Sharing sensor data with a cloud data center as intermediary invokes transmission methods with high battery costs, such as 4G LTE or WiFi. By sharing sensor information locally and without intermediaries, we can use other transmission methods with low energy cost, such as Bluetooth or BLE. In this paper, we introduce Sense Low Energy (SenseLE), a decentralized sensing framework which exploits the spatial locality of nearby sensors to save energy in Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments. We demonstrate the usability of SenseLE by building a real-life application for estimating waiting times at queues. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance and resource utilization of our SenseLE Android implementation for different sensing scenarios. Our empirical evaluation shows that by exploiting spatial locality, SenseLE is able to reduce application response times (latency) by up to 74% and energy consumption by up to 56%.

In order to apply indoor positioning technologies in any places and for any targets inexpensively and easily, the system should utilize simple sensors and devices. In addition, due to the scalability, it is necessary to perform indoor positioning algorithms on the device itself, not on the server. In this paper, we construct standalone embedded hardware for performing the indoor positioning algorithm. We use the geomagnetic field for indoor localization, which does not require the installation of infrastructure and has more stable signal strength than RF RSS. In addition, we propose low-memory schemes based on the characteristics of the geomagnetic sensor measurement and convergence of the target's estimated positions in order to implement indoor positioning algorithm to the hardware. We evaluate the performance in two testbeds: Hana Square (about 94 m x 26 m) and SK Future Hall (about 60 m x 38 m) indoor testbeds. We can reduce flash memory usage to 16.3% and 6.58% for each testbed and SRAM usage to 8.78% and 23.53% for each testbed with comparable localization accuracy to the system based on smart devices without low-memory schemes.

Home-based self-testing (HBST) for HIV holds promise for promoting regular testing among these individuals, but currently available HBSTs have limited follow-up options, providing only a 1-800 number that participants can call. Failure to actively conduct follow-up counseling and referrals after HBST use could result in delays in seeking confirmatory testing and care among users receiving reactive (preliminary positive) test results. HBST also fails to connect users who test negative with other prevention services that can reduce their future risk for HIV. Objective: The aim of our study was to use qualitative research methods with high-risk MSM to inform development of a "smart" HBST kit. The kit utilizes existing Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies to monitor HBST use in real-time and enable delivery of timely, active follow-up counseling and referrals over the phone. Methods: In phase 1, individual interviews (n=10) explored how participants might use HBST and their views and preferences for conducting counseling and referral after HBST. Based on these perspectives, we developed a smartphone app (iOS, Android) that uses data from light sensors on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons to monitor when HBST kits are opened, facilitating timely follow-up phone contact with users. In phase 2, a usability study conducted among high-risk MSM (n=10) examined the acceptability and feasibility of this system and provided user perspectives after using the system along with HBST. Results: Phase 1 themes suggested that MSM preferred HBST, that most thought active follow-up after HBST would be valuable, and that doing so over the phone within 24 h after testing was preferable. Phase 2 results showed that the eTEST system successfully detected HBST use in nearly all cases. Participant perspectives also suggested that the timing, method (ie, phone call), and duration of follow-up were appropriate and helpful. Conclusions: Using BLE beacons and a smartphone app to enable follow-up counseling and referral over the phone after HBST use is feasible and acceptable to high-risk MSM. Future research is needed to compare the effects of follow-up counseling on rates of repeat testing and receipt of referral services (eg, testing for sexually transmitted infections and initiation of preexposure prophylaxis) and to explore the acceptability of the eTEST system over longer periods of time.

C	Sakamura, K			IEEE	Sakamura, Ken			IEEE Std 2050-2018: the standardization of mu T-Kernel 2.0-A compact and efficient real-time OS for embedded computers	2018 IEEE 7TH GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (GCCE 2018)	IEEE Global Conference on Consumer Electronics		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 7th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	OCT 09-12, 2018	Nara, JAPAN	IEEE				Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) is an important emerging technology. Typical IoT application architecture consists of the cloud and the edge nodes. For cloud computing, resource-rich environment allows the use of powerful CPUs. On the other hand, edge nodes need to be lightweight to operate in resource-poor environment so that we can connect many objects in our surrounding to the cloud. Thus, the CPUs for edge nodes arc often not so powerful. Due the scarce resources, the system software for edge nodes must be lightweight (e.g., small memory footprint, low-power consumption, etc.). It also needs talk to the cloud using appropriate low-power network protocol stack such as Bluetooth Low Energy, 6LoWPAN, etc., and often needs to response to external stimuli in a real-time fashion. TRON Project, under the leadership of Ken Sakamura, has tackled the needs for such embedded computers by providing a series of TRON real-time OSs (RTOSs) since its inception in 1984. The TRON RTOS family has enjoyed the use by many users and in variety of applications: control modules of Japanese space satellite, consumer electronics goods such as digital cameras, printers, copiers, mobile phones (its RF module control), automobile engine control, etc. The TRON RTOS family specifications have become the de facto standards of RTOS in Japan and beyond. In August 2017, TRON Forum, an not-for-profit organization that promotes the activity of TRON Project, signed an agreement with IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) to share the copyright of the specification of mu T-Kernel 2.0, the latest member of TRON RTOS family, for the explicit purpose of turning the specification into an IEEE standard. An IEEE SA working group, WG 2050, was formed in late 2017 for the standardization work. Mr. Stephen Dukes of IEEE Consumer Electronics Society chaired the WC,. The WG membership consisted of stakeholders in consumer electronics industry. Thanks to the diligence of WG 2050, IEEE Std 2050-2018 based on the original mu T-Kernel 2.0 specification became an official IEEE standard in July 2018 in a record-breaking short time for such a document to become an IEEE standard. IEEE has already produced the famous POSIX standard for UNIX-like operating systems that can be used on the resource-rich cloud side. VT-Kernel 2.0 is meant to be the OS for the resource-poor edge node side. It is hoped that IEEE Std 2050-2018 will popularize and encourage the use of mu T-Kernel 2.0 by many engineers all over the world.

The cellular clocks outside the brain are effectively coordinated by the body temperature rhythm. We hypothesized that concurrent measurements of body temperature and rest-activity rhythms would assess circadian clocks coordination in individual patients, thus enabling the integration of biological rhythms into precision medicine. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the circadian clocks' coordination in healthy subjects and patients through simultaneous measurements of rest-activity and body temperature rhythms. Methods: Noninvasive real-time measurements of rest-activity and chest temperature rhythms were recorded during the subject's daily life, using a dedicated new mobile electronic health platform (PiCADo). It involved a chest sensor that jointly measured accelerations, 3D orientation, and skin surface temperature every 1-5 min and relayed them out to a mobile gateway via Bluetooth Low Energy. The gateway tele-transmitted all stored data to a server via General Packet Radio Service every 24 hours. The technical capabilities of PiCADo were validated in 55 healthy subjects and 12 cancer patients, whose rhythms were e-monitored during their daily routine for 3-30 days. Spectral analyses enabled to compute rhythm parameters values, with their 90% confidence limits, and their dynamics in each subject. Results: All the individuals displayed a dominant circadian rhythm in activity with maxima occurring from 12:09 to 20:25. This was not the case for the dominant temperature period, which clustered around 24 hours for 51 out of 67 subjects (76%), and around 12 hours for 13 others (19%). Statistically significant sex- and age-related differences in circadian coordination were identified in the noncancerous subjects, based upon the range of variations in temperature rhythm amplitudes, maxima (acrophases), and phase relations with rest-activity. The circadian acrophase of chest temperature was located at night for the majority of people, but it occurred at daytime for 26% (14/55) of the noncancerous people and 33% (4/12) of the cancer patients, thus supporting important intersubject differences in circadian coordination. Sex, age, and cancer significantly impacted the circadian coordination of both rhythms, based on their phase relationships. Conclusions: Complementing rest-activity with chest temperature circadian e-monitoring revealed striking intersubject differences regarding human circadian clocks' coordination and timing during daily routine. To further delineate the clinical importance of such finding, the PiCADo platform is currently applied for both the assessment of health effects resulting from atypical work schedules and the identification of the key determinants of circadian disruption in cancer patients.

The proposed system includes a front-end device and a software system. The front-end device includes a solar charging circuit, a wireless charging circuit and an analog front-end circuit. First, the solar charging block takes a dye-sensitized sorlar cell from National Chung Hsing University, which is responsible for energy harvesting under indoor illuminance. Second, the wireless charging block gives users an additional charging method to meet the demand of long-term monitoring. Third, the analog front-end block is composed of the ECG-sensing circuit, the microcontroller unit (MCU) and the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. The ECG-sensing circuit is based on single lead measurement, and it includes level shifter units, differential amplifiers and filters. The circuits are implemented by the commercial components and realized by self-designed print circuit boards (PCB). On the other hand, this paper takes ARM Cortex M4 and BLE 5.0 as the solution for data transmitting and encoding. All the above circuits are integrated into one PCB, and the prototype is designed by 3D-printer. The whole ECG Patch's size is 86.6 mm* 50 mm* 20 mm. The software system includes an application (APP) with DT algorithms, a cloud server is available to execute DT training and to provide a user interface for supporting telemedicine. This paper proposes a simplified DT model, which can be realized in APP based on iOS system. The APP classifies real-time ECG data into different arrhythmias, and the delay latency is 500 ms in average. Meanwhile, according to 4G or Wi-Fi, the collected ECG data are uploaded to the cloud server for training DT. Then, the coefficients of the pre-trained DT will be sent back to the APP for updating. The accuracy is 98.7%. By the proposed AIoT system, doctors and users can realize the task of long-term ECG monitoring, which is valuable for cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Also, doctors can assist users instantly by the web user interface, to meet the demands of telemedicine. The proposed AIoT system has been conducted human trials in National Cheng Kung University Hospital. The power consumption of the proposed front-end device is 8.25 mW, and it can be continuously used up to 32 hours with a 120 mAh lithium-ion battery. If it turns on solar charging, the device can continually operate, until the solar cell is dead.

To achieve the foundation of a new lifestyle, it is necessary to recognize the daily life patterns of users and give triggers for behavior change to users in their daily life. To realize this, in our research, we develop an interactive signage which is able to identify and actively talk to the passing user and try to induce behavior change by sending visual and auditory stimulation. Then, we record users' reactions and upload them to the server. In this paper, we report the investigation result on users' reactions and feelings to the developed interactive signage. As a survey experiment, we set up four interactive signs on a floor of our university and asked 15 participants to carry a name tag with a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon during their daily life. Five kinds of tasks based on dialogue scenarios are posted to the approaching participants. Participants can respond to these tasks through a touchscreen. The period of the experiment was three weeks. To get the data in an ideal environment, during the first week, we asked all the participants to respond to the utterance from the interactive signage whenever they hear the voice message. During the next two weeks, participants were not asked to respond to the task definitely to get the data in the real environment. The result of the experiment showed that our proposed interactive signage could induce behavior change effectively. Based on the result of experiment, we updated our interactive signage system by adding response time (the time passed from showing contents until user respond), record function, and voice feedback function. Furthermore, to collect the data of response time that is considered as a part of users' reactions, we conducted an additional experiment with the same participants in previous experiment (except for one missing participant) for one week after updating the system. In the additional experiment, the participants were not asked to respond to the utterance definitely. As a result, it is shown that the behavior change by the proposed signage is still effectively induced. We also analyzed the relationship between the day passed and the response rate of each task type. The result shows that the number of ignorance of personal task and check task does not rise even as the time passes.

A good diagnosis of diabetes may make a person's life better; otherwise, it can cause kidney failure, major heart damage, and damage to the blood vessels and nerves. As a result, diabetes classification and diagnosis are vital tasks. By using our proposed methodology, clinicians may obtain complete information about their patients using real-time monitoring. To gain new insights, they can combine historical information with current data, making it easier for them to perform more thorough and comprehensive treatments than before, and they will be able to provide proactive care, which will help to improve health outcomes and reduce hospital re-admissions. Diabetes is a long-term illness caused by the inefficient use of insulin generated by the pancreas. If diabetes is detected at an early stage, patients can live their lives healthier. Unlike previously used analytical approaches, deep learning does not need feature extraction. In order to support this viewpoint, we developed a real-time monitoring hybrid deep learning-based model to detect and predict Type 2 diabetes mellitus using the publicly available PIMA Indian diabetes database. This study contributes in four ways. First, we perform a comparative study of different deep learning models. Based on experimental findings, we next suggested merging two models, CNN-Bi-LSTM, to detect (and predict) Type 2 diabetes. These findings demonstrate that CNN-Bi-LSTM surpasses the other deep learning methods in terms of accuracy (98%), sensitivity (97%), and specificity (98%), and it is 1.1% better compared to other existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Hence, our proposed model helps clinicians obtain complete information about their patients using real-time monitoring and can check real-time statistics about their vitals.

In practice, both positions provided by Wi-Fi data and relative distance provided by Bluetooth data are subject to a certain degree of noise due to the uncertainty of radio propagation in complex indoor environments. In this study, we propose and evaluate two approaches, namely Non-temporal and Temporal ones, of collaborative positioning to combine these two cohabiting technologies to improve the tracking performance. In the Non-temporal approach, our model establishes an error observation function in a specific interval of the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi output. It is then able to reduce the positioning error by looking for ways to minimize the error function. The Temporal approach employs an extended error model that takes into account the time component between users' movements. For performance evaluation, several multi-user scenarios in an indoor environment are set up. Results show that for certain scenarios, the proposed approaches attain over 40% of improvement in terms of average accuracy.

A number of open challenges affect practical deployments, such as simultaneous use of multiple technologies, intelligent coordination of a subset of nodes, coexistence of different technologies using the same spectrum, efficient management of (simultaneously used) heterogeneous radio links, etc. This paper will consider Semantic Technology (ST), as a promising approach to coordination in such complex wireless infrastructures, especially in cases where interference models are not well understood. A Neural Network (NN) will be used for the network state estimation and ST for reasoning about required actions. It is based on semantic data sets mining such that coordination decisions may be driven by predictions instead of using physical spectrum sensing devices. ST facilitates reasoning about coordination, application priority, frequency selection and dynamic spectrum access. Because of capability of the NN to solve regression and classification problems, potentially problematic network states could be proactively avoided instead of reactively corrected particularly in priority critical applications.

In the area of electronic health (eHealth), many of these devices provide remote transfer of health data, as a result of the increasing need for ambulatory monitoring of patients. This has a potential to reduce the cost of care due to prevention and early detection. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide an overview of available wearable sensor systems with data exchange possibilities. Due to the heterogeneous capabilities these systems possess today, we aimed to systematize this in terms of usage, where there is a need of, or users benefit from, transferring self-collected data to health care actors. Methods: We searched for and reviewed relevant sensor systems (i.e., devices) and mapped these into 13 selected attributes related to data-exchange capabilities. We collected data from the Vandrico database of wearable devices, and complemented the information with an additional internet search. We classified the following attributes of devices: type, communication interfaces, data protocols, smartphone/PC integration, connection to smartphone health platforms, 3rd party integration with health platforms, connection to health care system/middleware, type of gathered health data, integrated sensors, medical device certification, access to user data, developer-access to device, and market status. Devices from the same manufacturer with similar functionalities/characteristics were identified under the same device family. Furthermore, we classified the systems in three subgroups of relevance for different actors in mobile health monitoring systems: EHR providers, software developers, and patient users. Results: We identified 362 different mobile health monitoring devices belonging to 193 device families. Based on an analysis of these systems, we identified the following general challenges: Few systems have a Conformite Europeene (CE) marking class II or above, or approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Few systems use the standardized Bluetooth Low Energy GATT profile for wireless transfer of health data Few systems support health middleware Approximately 30% of the device families provide the user access to the source data. However, only 16% allow the transfer of data through direct communication with the device (i.e., without using a proprietary cloud-based service) Conclusions: Few of the identified mobile health monitoring systems use standardized, open communication protocols, which would allow the user to directly acquire sensor data. Use of open protocols can provide mobile health (mHealth) application developers an alternative to proprietary cloud services and communication tools, which are often closely integrated with the devices. Emerging new types of sensors, often intended for everyday use, have a potential to supplement health records systems with data that can enrich patient care.

Therefore, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers, low cost Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors, barometers and magnetometers have been the standard configuration for many current smartphones, smart watches and tablets to provide positioning information. Although Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) based portable navigation system with GNSS and multiple sensors is able to provide promising positioning results in most outdoor environments, in the absence of GNSS signals in indoor or deep urban environments, it still lacks robustness because of the accumulated heading error and step length error, in addition to the challenges of portability and free change of the orientation and usage of the device by the user. These shortcomings will cause a skewed path over time and produce position estimates that might not be consistent with the building layout. The resulting paths cross walls, floors or other obstacles. Although magnetometer measurements can be used to update the heading, they are vulnerable to interferences which are quite common in complex indoor environments. This paper proposes a robust indoor navigation solution integrating low-cost sensors in consumer devices with indoor map matching and wireless positioning. The user can operate the portable device freely without constraints, such as talking on the phone, dangling the phone beside them, texting, putting the phone in their pocket, on their belt or in their backpack. The motion context detection algorithm can detect the user's motion patterns such as walking, fidgeting, going up/down stairs, standing/walking on escalators, or using elevators. The proposed map matching engine is based on multihypothesis Kalman filter and is very computationally efficient. The map match engine can manage the hypothesis creation, trim and removal based on the user position uncertain and the motion context. These motion contexts can be used to apply 2D position update to improve positioning performance and also to initiate floor changes. Furthermore, any incorrect misalignment between portable devices and the human body can be monitored and corrected based on the current indoor environments. Moreover, the map match engine analyzes the history of the user's trajectory and indoor environments to improve the step length estimates from PDR. Finally, the indoor map is combined with WiFi positioning to derive a more reliable weighting scheme based on the indoor environments. Also, with the map information, WiFi blunders can be more reliably removed. The proposed system can also use heading and speed estimated from the wireless system, if they are available; it is also capable of taking other wireless updates if they are available, such as for example from Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Real-time test results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed portable positioning system.

Information about sedentary behavior, such as how everyday sedentary behavior occurs throughout the day (eg, number and length of sedentary bouts), where, when, and with whom it takes place, and what people are doing while being sedentary, is useful to inform the development of interventions aimed at reducing sedentary time. However, examining everyday sedentary behavior requires specific methods. Objective: The purpose of this paper is (1) to introduce sedentary behavior-triggered Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) as a methodological advancement in the field of sedentary behavior research and (2) to examine the accuracy of sedentary behavior-triggered EMA in 3 different studies in healthy adults. Moreover, we compare the accuracy of sedentary behavior-triggered EMA to simulations of random-trigger designs. Methods: Sedentary behavior-triggered EMA comprises a continuous assessment of sedentary behavior via accelerometers and repeated contextual assessments via electronic diaries (ie, an application on a smartphone). More specifically, the accelerometer analyzes and transfers data regarding body position (a sitting or lying position, or an upright position) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a smartphone in real time and triggers the deployment of questionnaires. Each time a participant spends a specified time (eg, 20 minutes) in a sedentary position, the e-diary triggers contextual assessments. To test the accuracy of this method, we calculated a percentage score for all triggered prompts in relation to the total number of bouts that could trigger a prompt. Results: Based on the accelerometer recordings, 29.3% (5062/17278) of all sedentary bouts were classified as moderate-to-long (20-40 minutes) and long bouts (>= 41 minutes). On average, the accuracy by participant was 82.77% (3339/4034; SD 21.01%, range 71.00-88.22%) on the study level. Compared to simulations of random prompts (every 120 minutes), the number of triggered prompts was up to 47.9% (n=704) higher through the sedentary behavior-triggered EMA approach. Nearly 40% (799/2001) of all prolonged sedentary bouts (>= 20 minutes) occurred during work, and in 57% (1140/2001) of all bouts, the participants were not alone. Conclusions: Sedentary behavior-triggered EMA is an accurate method for collecting contextual information on sedentary behavior in daily life. Given the growing interest in sedentary behavior research, this sophisticated approach offers a real advancement as it can be used to collect social and environmental contextual information or to unravel dynamic associations. Furthermore, it can be modified to develop sedentary behavior-triggered mHealth interventions.

In addition to that, continuous learning is required in many working areas to be able to deal with constant technological improvements. This is especially important for companies in the high-tech sector, in which employees are dealing with state of the art technologies. As an example, employees in industrial production facilities (like in the car industry) need to improve their skills whenever new components are added to the manufacturing process. Therefore, they can hugely benefit from learning on the job. Learning on the job while working in a production facility allows employees to extend their knowledge at the same time and at their current location when they require it. This usually takes place in a situational context, i.e. the context of the learner is related to the learning content. An example for situated learning on the job in manufacturing is an industrial mechanic who looks up instructions for the next production step. In contrast to off-the-job training the learning content is adjusted to the learner's current context. Augmented reality learning is one solution which can be used to enable situated learning on the job. This can be achieved by the use of wearable computers (wearables). As wearables are worn by the user and as such portable, always operational and allow a hands-free use, they can be used by employees in many situations when learning content is required. Furthermore, wearables can analyze the environment and its' surrounding context using build-in sensors (like GPS and Bluetooth for localization or image sensors for pattern matching) to provide situational learning content. This could even be done proactively, i.e. the wearable notifies the employee about relevant learning materials on its own. The main goal of this paper is to determine how learning in manufacturing companies can be supported using augmented reality learning on wearables. Therefore, we will first focus on identifying application scenarios in industrial production facilities which can benefit from using augmented reality learning to enhance the employees' skills on the job. Besides the identification of scenarios, we present a prototype for smart glasses which is targeted at employees in industrial production facilities for supporting learning on the job. It can be used for displaying learning content which is linked to real objects or locations using Bluetooth low energy. The prototype is developed for running natively on Google Glass. The results of this paper-the identified applications scenarios and the developed prototype-can be used as a basis for further research and for developing and deploying augmented reality learning applications in companies.

The international experience of digital contact tracing apps during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates how challenging their design and deployment are. Objective: This study aims to derive and summarize best practice guidance for the design of the ideal digital contact tracing app. Methods: A collaborative cross-disciplinary approach was used to derive best practice guidance for designing the ideal digital contact tracing app. A search of the indexed and gray literature was conducted to identify articles describing or evaluating digital contact tracing apps. MEDLINE was searched using a combination of free-text terms and Medical Subject Headings search terms. Gray literature sources searched were the World Health Organization Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control publications library, and Google, including the websites of many health protection authorities. Articles that were acceptable for inclusion in this evidence synthesis were peer-reviewed publications, cohort studies, randomized trials, modeling studies, technical reports, white papers, and media reports related to digital contact tracing. Results: Ethical, user experience, privacy and data protection, technical, clinical and societal, and evaluation considerations were identified from the literature. The ideal digital contact tracing app should be voluntary and should be equitably available and accessible. User engagement could be enhanced by small financial incentives, enabling users to tailor aspects of the app to their particular needs and integrating digital contact tracing apps into the wider public health information campaign. Adherence to the principles of good data protection and privacy by design is important to convince target populations to download and use digital contact tracing apps. Bluetooth Low Energy is recommended for a digital contact tracing app's contact event detection, but combining it with ultrasound technology may improve a digital contact tracing app's accuracy. A decentralized privacy-preserving protocol should be followed to enable digital contact tracing app users to exchange and record temporary contact numbers during contact events. The ideal digital contact tracing app should define and risk-stratify contact events according to proximity, duration of contact, and the infectiousness of the case at the time of contact. Evaluating digital contact tracing apps requires data to quantify app downloads, use among COVID-19 cases, successful contact alert generation, contact alert receivers, contact alert receivers that adhere to quarantine and testing recommendations, and the number of contact alert receivers who subsequently are tested positive for COVID-19. The outcomes of digital contact tracing apps' evaluations should be openly reported to allow for the wider public to review the evaluation of the app. Conclusions: In conclusion, key considerations and best practice guidance for the design of the ideal digital contact tracing app were derived from the literature.

The current gold standard for detecting this type of people with sleep disorder is Polysomnography (PSG). But more than 80% Obstructive Sleep Apnea(OSA) patients of the Sleep Disorder(SD) have not been detected. The reason is that the current configuration of PSG is insufficient in more than 2,500 sleep labs in the United States, and that the lack of manpower of sleep professional technicians who analyze PSG signal has caused many OSA patients to be diagnosed in a timely and effective manner. It is no effective measures to reduce the risk even after OSA patients have been diagnosed. Current medical treatments are either surgical or a lifelong Continuous positive dual channel air pressure ventilator(CPAP). Domestic research shows that OSA patients have poor sleep at night and sleepiness during the day. It often results in inefficient work and causes many traffic accidents. Therefore, how to take effective monitoring measures for these already diagnosed OSA patients has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper extracts an interactive monitoring system for patients with OSA based on the Internet of Things(IoT) framework. It can reduce the timely rescue of OSA patients when they are in danger in field operations. At the same time, through the interactive function of this indicator mark, the anxiety during the waiting process can be reduced. It is also convenient for the peers to report the progress of the patient in time. The specific method is to use the existing IoT framework. The IoT data acquisition layer uses wearable sensors to collect vital signs of patients, with emphasis on ECG and SpO2 signals. The network layer transmits the collected physiological signals to the Beidou indicator using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The platform layer adopts the mature rescue interaction platform of Beidou&GPS. The previous GPS indicator has no short message function, and the patient can only passively wait for rescue. Positional standard is improved through Beidou model, and the short message interaction function has been added. Then the patient can report the progress of the disease in time while waiting for the rescue. After our simulation test, the effectiveness of the OSA patient rescue monitoring system based on the IoT framework has been greatly improved, especially in outdoor work, where the mobile phone signal coverage is relatively weak. The short message function added by the Beidou indicator can be used to provide timely progress of the patient's condition, and provide the medical rescue team with the data support to offer a more accurate rescue plan. After a comparative trial, the rescue rate of the OSA patients with the detection device of this article increased by 10 percentage points compared with the rescue rate with only GPS satellite phones.

J	Yamamoto, H; Nishiura, S; Higashiura, Y				Yamamoto, Hiroshi; Nishiura, Shota; Higashiura, Yoshihiro			Wide-Area and Long-Term Agricultural Sensing System Utilizing UAV and Wireless Technologies	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						key agricultural sensing system; UAV; LPWA; BLE; wireless posi-tioning; wireless power transfer	POWER	In order to improve crop production and efficiency of farming operations, an IoT (Internet of Things) system for remote mon-itoring has been attracting a lot of attention. The existing studies have proposed agricultural sensing systems such that environmental information is collected from many sensor nodes installed in farmland through wire-less communications (e.g., Wi-Fi, ZigBee). Especially, Low-Power Wide -Area (LPWA) is a focus as a candidate for wireless communication that enables the support of vast farmland for a long time. However, it is diffi- cult to achieve long distance communication even when using the LPWA because a clear line of sight is difficult to keep due to many obstacles such as crops and agricultural machinery in the farmland. In addition, a sensor node cannot run permanently on batteries because the battery capacity is not infinite. On the other hand, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that can move freely and stably in the sky has been leveraged for agricultural sensor network systems. By utilizing a UAV as the gateway of the sen-sor network, the gateway can move to the appropriate location to ensure a clear line of sight from the sensor nodes. In addition, the coverage area of the sensor network can be expanded as the UAV travels over a wide area even when short-range and ultra-low-power wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)) is adopted. Furthermore, various wireless technologies (e.g., wireless power transfer, wireless positioning) that have the possibility to improve the coverage area and the lifetime of the sensor network have become available. Therefore, in this study, we propose and develop two kinds of new agricultural sensing systems utilizing a UAV and various wireless technologies. The objective of the proposed system is to provide the solution for achieving the wide-area and long-term sensing for the vast farmland. Depending on which problem is in a priority, the pro-posed system chooses one of two designs. The first design of the system attempts to achieve the wide-area sensing, and so it is based on the LPWA for wireless communication. In the system, to efficiently collect the en-vironmental information, the UAV autonomously travels to search for the locations to maintain the good communication properties of the LPWA to the sensor nodes dispersed over a wide area of farmland. In addition, the second design attempts to achieve the long-term sensing, so it is based on BLE, a typical short-range and ultra-low-power wireless communication technology. In this design, the UAV autonomously flies to the location of sensor nodes and supplies power to them using a wireless power transfer technology for achieving a battery-less sensor node. Through experimental evaluations using a prototype system, it is confirmed that the combination of the UAV and various wireless technologies has the possibility to achieve a wide-area and long-term sensing system for monitoring vast farmland.

This paper presents a progressive schema which starts from pose browse, then locates the interesting region and then switches to online relevant motion exploration. It mainly addresses three core issues. First, to alleviate the contradiction between the limited visual space and ever-increasing size of real-world database, it applies affinity propagation to numerical similarity measure of pose to perform data abstraction and obtains representative poses of clusters. Second, to construct a meaningful neighborhood for user browsing, it further merges logical similarity measures of pose with the weight quartets and casts the isolated representative poses into a structure of phylogenetic tree. Third, to support online motion exploration including motion ranking and clustering, a biLSTM-based auto-encoder is proposed to encode the high-dimensional pose context into compact latent space.

J	Li, MF; Li, GY; Chen, HR; Jiang, CW				Li, Mingfu; Li, Guan-Yi; Chen, Hou-Ren; Jiang, Cheng-Wei			QoE-Aware Smart Home Energy Management Considering Renewables and Electric Vehicles	ENERGIES			English	Article						dynamic electricity prices; electric vehicles (EV); fuzzy control; home energy management system (HEMS); peak load; quality of experience (QoE); renewable energy	BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; DEMAND RESPONSE; INTEGRATION; CONTROLLER	To reduce the peak load and electricity bill while preserving the user comfort, a quality of experience (QoE)-aware smart appliance control algorithm for the smart home energy management system (sHEMS) with renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) was proposed. The proposed algorithm decreases the peak load and electricity bill by deferring starting times of delay-tolerant appliances from peak to off-peak hours, controlling the temperature setting of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and properly scheduling the discharging and charging periods of an EV. In this paper, the user comfort is evaluated by means of QoE functions. To preserve the user's QoE, the delay of the starting time of a home appliance and the temperature setting of HVAC are constrained by a QoE threshold. Additionally, to solve the trade-off problem between the peak load/electricity bill reduction and user's QoE, a fuzzy logic controller for dynamically adjusting the QoE threshold to optimize the user's QoE was also designed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed smart appliance control algorithm with a fuzzy-controlled QoE threshold significantly reduces the peak load and electricity bill while optimally preserving the user's QoE. Compared with the baseline case, the proposed scheme reduces the electricity bill by 65% under the scenario with RES and EV. Additionally, compared with the method of optimal scheduling of appliances in the literature, the proposed scheme achieves much better peak load reduction performance and user's QoE.

Railcars often take up to 24 hours to be processed through a railyard due to the need for manual inbound inspection, car classification, manual outbound inspection, and other intermediate processes. Much of the inspection and repair process has historically been completed manually with handwritten documents. Until recently, car inspections were rarely documented unless repairs were required. Currently, when a defect is detected in the yard, the railcar inspector must complete a "bad order" form that is adhered to each side of the car. This process may take up to ten minutes per bad order. To reduce labor costs and improve efficiency, asset management technology and Internet-of Things (IoT) frameworks can now be developed to reduce labor time needed to record bad orders, increase inspection visibility, and provide the opportunity to implement analytics and cognitive insights to optimize worker productivity and facilitate condition-based maintenance. The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost prototype electronic freight car inspection tracking system for small-scale (short line and regional) railroad companies. This system allows car inspectors to record mechanical inspection data using a ruggedized mobile platform (e.g. tablet or smartphone). This data may then be used to improve inspection quality and efficiency as well as reduce inspection redundancy. Data collection will involve two approaches. The first approach is the development of an Android-based mobile application to electronically record and store inspection data using a smartphone or rugged tablet. This automates the entire bad order form process by connecting to IBM's Bluemix Cloudant NoSQL database. It allows for the information to be accessed by railroad mechanical managers or car owners, anywhere and at any time. The second approach is a web-based Machine-to-Machine (M2M) system using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and beacon technology to store car inspection data on a secure website and/or a cloudant database. This approach introduces the freight car inspection process to the "physical web," and it will offer numerous additional capabilities that are not possible with the current radio frequency identification device (RFID) system used for freight car tracking. By connecting railcars to the physical web, railcar specifications and inspection data can be updated in real-time and be made universally available. At the end of this paper, an evaluation and assessment is made of both the benefits and drawbacks of each of these approaches. The evaluation suggests that although some railroads may immediately benefit from these technological solutions, others may be better off with the current manual method until IoT and M2M become more universally accepted within the railroad industry. The primary value of this analysis is to provide a decision framework for railroads seeking to implement IoT systems in their freight car inspection practices. As an additional result, the software and IoT source code for the mobile app developed for this project will be open source to promote future collaboration within the industry.

J	Sun, FM; Yi, CF; Li, WN; Li, Y				Sun, Fangmin; Yi, Chenfu; Li, Weinan; Li, Ye			A wearable H-shirt for exercise ECG monitoring and individual lactate threshold computing	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						H-shirt; Wearable; Exercise ECG; Lactate threshold; Accurate	QRS-DETECTION; SENSORS; SYSTEM; COMPRESSION; ACQUISITION; SMARTPHONE; ELECTRODES; PLATFORM	Millions of people worldwide are involved in daily physical exercise and fitness, which implies the growing demand for wearable devices and gadgets monitoring these activities. To ensure the comfort of exercise, wearable health monitoring devices are the most lucrative for real-time and continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, which is essential for making individualized fitness plans and avoiding the occurrence of cardiac arrest. Moreover, the ECG monitoring data obtained are instrumental in the computation of the individual lactate threshold heart rate, which is the inflection point of the heart rate-time curve and indicates the exercise intensity level, at which the blood concentration of lactate and lactic acid begins to exponentially increase and will result in overstraining, unless the exercise efforts (running speed or muscle intensity) are temporarily reduced. The respective monitoring and overstrain warning devices have a large potential for the individual assessment of the endurance performance, as well as for prescribing intensities in the endurance training. However, the common drawbacks of commercial wearable devices used in healthcare and medical fields for continuous monitoring of ECG, electroencephalogram, respiration, temperature, SpO(2), and human activity, such as smart helmets, wearable patches, and activity-tracking bands, are motion artifacts and unstable skin-electrode contact, which jeopardize the accurate measurements during exercise. Given this, the Health shirt (H-shirt) integrated with conductive fabric ECG electrodes enabling the accurate ECG monitoring during physical exercise has been introduced and validated by the authors. In this paper, the modified design of the sports H-shirt with the lactate threshold heart rate computing is proposed and implemented. High elasticity of the H-shirt not only ensures a stable skin-electrode contact but also avoids the discomfort caused by the measurement. A highly integrated printed circuit board is used to filter, amplify, digitalize, and transmit the ECG signal sampled from the electrodes, while a high input impedance amplifier circuit is designed to improve its signal-to-noise ratio. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is used as the data transmission protocol between the H-shirt and the mobile phone. A mobile phone-based ECG analysis and exercise evaluation platform have been developed, which allow one to detect six types of abnormal ECG (tachycardia, bradycardia, a dropped beat, premature beat, bigeminy, and trigeminy) and individual lactate threshold, as well as to provide real-time health warning and exercise optimization hints through mobile phone Voice messages. Being powered by a 150 mAh 3.7 V lithium battery, the H-shirt operated for at least 24 h and was tested on four volunteers of both genders and age from 14 to 32 years, whose ECG and the lactate threshold heart rate values were accurately measured during their test exercise on a treadmill with running speed up to 16 km/h and used as a reference for the users to adjust their exercise intensity. The available options of adding sensors for measurement of more physiological parameters by the proposed sports H-shirt make it quite lucrative for the rehabilitation exercise monitoring.

Starting by introducing the whole system, PMS obtains pilot's vital data in real time with two wearable devices (smartwatch and ear sensor). It is able to determine stress, fatigue, workload, health status and pilot capacity with new models based on DCNN encoded in Python which are able to interpret these vital data. Additionally, PMS is able to launch alerts when the vital parameters of the crew reach pre-established limits, giving the chance to detect an abnormal situation (e.g. excessive workload scenario with high stress level). In this way, it will improve situational awareness by making crew aware of their own condition Going deeper into the details of the Stress Model, its main objective is to determine Pilot stress in real time. For achieving this target, several design stages were taken into consideration while building the Stress Model DCNN: raw data acquisition, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training, model evaluation, model testing, and result analysis. Further details of these stages are explained below. Regarding data acquisition, Stress Model obtains pilot's vital data from a smartwatch (one of the wearable devices of PMS), which communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a laptop. Selected device was Analog Devices Inc. Gen II watch, which sends the following signals: Heart Rate (HR), ElectroDermal Activity (EDA), Skin temperature and 3D Acceleration. At Cleaning stage, Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) was used to normalize our raw data, being less sensitive to outliers and therefore more robust. At Feature engineering stage, several signal combinations were explored. The selected signal set which gave the best Stress Model accuracy was comprised of two EDA parameters (Real Admittance [Siemens], Impedance Magnitude [Ohm]) and wrist Skin Temperature [deg C]. At Algorithm selection stage, three convolutional layers (128, 256 and 128 filters respectively) were chosen to extract a feature map from the inputs. After them, a Global Average Pooling (GAP) was chosen to compress the convolutions output. Downstream GAP, a decision layer based on softmax activation function (stress vs non-stress) was chosen. At Training stage, it was necessary to implement a Stress Test recording campaign. Participants were asked to fulfill several individual demanding tasks (memory, multi-task, stroop, vigilance) which included relaxing periods among them. The Stress Model was fed with the vital data obtained in this campaign. In between the tasks, NASA-TLX questionnaires were filled by test subjects, to obtain their subjective rating of Mental demand, Physical demand, Temporal demand, Performance, Effort and Frustration. Therefore, the Stress Model considered both vital data and self-report questionnaires as inputs. At result analysis stage, the Stress Model accuracy was refined, understanding accuracy as the ratio between correct predicted stress scenarios versus total cases, and considering ground truth self-report questionnaires. Finally, Stress Model DCNN was validated considering three data sources, whose details are included below: A. Vital data from fifteen (N=15) subjects of Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) Database available online. Stress Model gave an average test accuracy of 99%, B. Vital data from four (N=4) Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) pilots while calibrating their NASATLX scale. Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 90%. C. Vital data from six (N=6) ADS pilots while performing simulator evaluations using an Enhanced Light Weight Visor (ELWEV). Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 87%.

Three types of wireless sensor technologies (Bluetooth, ZigBee, and ANT) have been used to monitor the biomechanical and physiological activities of bicycles and cyclists, respectively. However, the wireless monitoring of these activities has faced some challenges. The aim of this paper is to highlight various methodologies for monitoring cycling to provide an effective and efficient way to overcome the various challenges and limitations of sports cycling using wireless sensor interfaces. Several design criteria were reviewed and compared with different solutions for the implementation of current WSN research, such as low power consumption, long distance communications, small size, and light weight. Conclusions were drawn after observing the example of an advanced and adaptive network technology (ANT) network highlighting reduced power consumption and prolonged battery life. The power saving achieved in the slave node was 88-95% compared to the similar ANT protocol used in the medical rehabilitation.

The use of a digital twin for performance is critical, and for capital-intensive equipment such as jet engines it proved to be successful in terms of cost savings and reliability improvements. In this paper, we aim to study the expansion of the digital twin in including building life cycle management and explore the benefits and shortcomings of such implementation. In four rounds of experimentation, more than 25,000 sensor reading instances were collected, analyzed, and utilized to create and test a limited digital twin of an office building facade element. This is performed to point out the method of implementation, highlight the benefits gained from digital twin, and to uncover some of the technical shortcomings of the current Internet of Things systems for this purpose.

Adopting Internet of Things for the development of smart buildings: A review of enabling technologies and applications	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Internet of Things (IoT); Smart buildings; Built environment; State of the art review; Application assessment	BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; COMFORT MANAGEMENT; IOT; SYSTEM; CONSTRUCTION; OPPORTUNITIES; REQUIREMENTS; INDUSTRY; HOMES	The 21st century is witnessing a fast-paced digital revolution. A significant trend is that cyber and physical environments are being unprecedentedly entangled with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has been widely immersed into various domains in the industry. Among those areas where IoT would make significant impacts are building construction, operation, and management by facilitating high-class services, providing efficient functionalities, and moving towards sustainable development goals. So far, IoT itself has entered an ambiguous phase for industrial utilization, and there are limited number of studies focusing on the application of IoT in the building industry. Given the promising future impact of IoT technologies on buildings, and the increasing interests in interdisciplinary research among academics, this paper investigates the state-of-the-art projects and adoptions of IoT for the development of smart buildings within both academia and industry contexts. The wide-ranging IoT concepts are provided, covering the necessary breadth as well as relevant topic depth that directly relates to smart buildings. Current enabling technologies of IoT, especially those applied to buildings and related areas are summarized, which encompasses three different layers based on the conventional IoT architecture. Afterwards, several recent applications of IoT technologies on buildings towards the critical goals of smart buildings are selected and presented. Finally, the priorities and challenges of successful and seamless IoT integration for smart buildings are discussed. Besides, this paper discusses the future research questions to advance the implementation of IoT technologies in both building construction and operation phases. The paper argues that a mature adoption of IoT technologies in the building industry is not yet realized and, therefore, calls for more attention from researchers in the relevant fields from the application perspective.

This provides the ability to sense, process, analyze and infer environmental parameters from natural resources and delicate ecologies to urban environments. The explosion in the number of devices that are connected to the internet has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technological revolution. In these technologies, actuators and sensors incorporate smoothly with the IoT environment. Furthermore, the sensed data is shared through platforms to innovate a common operating picture. This cuffing-edge technology is fueled by a diversity of IoT devices that enables technologies such as near field communication, embedded actuator, sensor nodes, radio frequency identification tags, and readers. IoT has emerged from its infancy and has established a fully integrated future internet. Different visions of IoT technologies have been reviewed, however, what emerges currently in this field should be faced and displayed via the research community. In this paper, we are keen to discuss the recent worldwide implementation of IoT, where the prime enabling technologies, recent and future communication protocols and application areas that drive IoT research in the near future are explored. Furthermore, the original, recent, future enhancements of all IoT stack's protocols are extensively discussed. Middleware's definition, usages, types and open research challenges are further illustrated. Not only to this extent but rather, this survey details the simulation tools of IoT networks, IoT sensors along with their recent application areas, broad IoT research challenges, as well as in-depth analysis of IoT research history and recommendations that attract current IoT researchers' attention.

Such autonomous control is of paramount importance for several deployments of the Internet of Things (IoT), including smart manufacturing applications, healthcare systems and home automation just to name a few. As a result, several M2M technologies are nowadays available on the market as either proprietary solutions or the effort of standardization initiatives, each targeted for a specific class of IoT applications and characterized by unique features in terms of achievable performance, frequency in use and supported network topologies. In this paper, we aim to organize the existing M2M approaches and technologies into a consistent framework that provides an in-depth vision of the main trends, future directions and open issues. We provide three main contributions in this survey. First, we identify the main use cases and requirements of M2M scenarios and we introduce a multi-layer taxonomy for M2M solutions, taking into account both deployment types and PHY/MAC characteristics. Second, in light of such characteristics, we provide an in-depth review of the existing M2Mwireless technologies, considering both proprietary and open/standardized solutions for proximity-based, short-range and large-scale networks. Finally, we perform a critical comparison of the surveyed solutions over different M2M use cases and requirements, and we identify the research directions and open issues that still have to be addressed.

In the last two decades, numerous IoT solutions have been developed by small, medium-sized, and large enterprises to make our lives easier. Furthermore, private and academic researchers have extensively investigated some practical IoT solutions. The rapid expansion of IoT solutions accompanies numerous security concerns because the underlying IoT protocols and communication technologies have not considered security. Recently, blockchain has emerged to become one of the promising technologies that might overcome some of the IoT limitations (security limitations, in particular). Blockchain technology is a database ledger that uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and stores transactions and asset registries. Blockchain can be described as a mounting list of records (i.e., blocks) with the following properties: distributed, decentralized, immutable, and shared. This paper surveyed recent security advances to overcome IoT limitations using blockchain. In this article, the blockchain attempts to overcome IoT limitations that are related to cyber security have been classified into four categories: end-to-end traceability; data privacy and anonymity; identity verification and authentication; and confidentiality, data integrity, and availability (CIA). Intended as a guideline for future research, this paper also explores systematic processes.

However, the contradiction between the high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of massive data and the limited network bandwidth and the heterogeneous network is becoming deeper and deeper. The heterogeneity of smart factory networks brings many challenges to unified access and fusion, real-time transmission, and centralized control and management. This article provides a survey on heterogeneous networks in smart factories. We first study and discuss the heterogeneity of smart factory networks, and then discuss the existing mainstream wired and wireless network technologies, as well as promising future technologies, including 5G, OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In addition, we also analyze current heterogeneous network fusion architecture and discuss the enabling technologies of heterogeneous network fusion in view of the shortcoming of the current solutions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards the effective realization of the smart factory.

However, applying the appropriate data fusion strategy to design an efficient energy efficiency system is not straightforward; it requires a priori knowledge of existing fusion strategies, their applications and their properties. To this regard, seeking to provide the energy research community with a better understanding of data fusion strategies in building energy saving systems, their principles, advantages, and potential applications, this paper proposes an extensive survey of existing data fusion mechanisms deployed to reduce excessive consumption and promote sustainability. We investigate their conceptualizations, advantages, challenges and drawbacks, as well as performing a taxonomy of existing data fusion strategies and other contributing factors. Following, a comprehensive comparison of the state-of-the-art data fusion based energy efficiency frameworks is conducted using various parameters, including data fusion level, data fusion techniques, behavioral change influencer, behavioral change incentive, recorded data, platform architecture, IoT technology and application scenario. Moreover, a novel method for electrical appliance identification is proposed based on the fusion of 2D local texture descriptors, where 1D power signals are transformed into 2D space and treated as images. The empirical evaluation, conducted on three real datasets, shows promising performance, in which up to 99.68% accuracy and 99.52% F1 score have been attained. In addition, various open research challenges and future orientations to improve data fusion based energy efficiency ecosystems are explored.

Wireless technologies, despite their offered convenience, flexibility, low cost, and mobility pose unique challenges such as fading, interference, energy, and security, which must be carefully addressed when using resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, the efforts of the research community have led to the standardization of several wireless technologies for various types of application domains depending on factors such as reliability, latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this paper, we first overview these standard wireless technologies, and we specifically study the MAC and physical layer technologies proposed to address the requirements and challenges of wireless communications. Furthermore, we explain the use of these standards in various application domains, such as smart homes, smart healthcare, industrial automation, and smart cities, and discuss their suitability in satisfying the requirements of these applications. In addition to proposing guidelines to weigh the pros and cons of each standard for an application at hand, we also examine what new strategies can be exploited to overcome existing challenges and support emerging IoT applications.

A smart city system aims at a seamless and secure interconnection of sensors, actuators, and data processing resources to ensure digital, efficient, and reliable services. In this article, we present a brief planar overview of a smart city system architecture by introducing the application, sensing, communication, data, and security/privacy planes. Tailoring existing communication protocols and infrastructures to bridge massively deployed sensors and data processing/storage resources introduces unique communication challenges for smart cities. Furthermore, coexistence, integration, and control of dedicated and non-dedicated sensors is a grand challenge while loT sensors continuously push sensory data through the communication medium towards data processing and analysis planes. While pervasiveness and ubiquity of smart city services are ensured by the interaction of communication and sensing technologies, their robustness and resilience call for customized security and privacy solutions. With these in mind, we focus on sensing/actuation, communication, and security planes of a smart city system and present a comprehensive survey of the challenges and state-of-the-art solutions in each plane. Furthermore, we provide insights for open issues and opportunities in these planes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			ISPO 17th world congress Kobe, Hyogo, Japan 5-8 Oct 2019 Abstracts	PROSTHETICS AND ORTHOTICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Meeting							EDUCATION; CARE	Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an inherently serious condition that have a profound physical, psychological, and socioeconomic impact on affected individuals. Recently, the incidence of incomplete SCIs are increasing, and the central nervous system of incomplete injury has the potential of plastic change. Hybrid assistive limb (HAL) is an exoskeleton robot suit that supports walking of persons with motor dysfunction. The effectiveness of HAL training on walking ability and balance in individuals with chronic SCI is still unlear. Aim To investigate the effctiveness of walking tarining with robot suit HAL for walking ability and balance in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury. Method Fifteen patients with chronic SCI (11 men, 4 women) classified by the American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) D (zone of partial preservation C4-L3), who received full rehabilitation in the acute and subacute phase of SCI were enrolled. A single case experimental A-B(pre-post) design study by repeated assessments of the same patients. The subjects performed 3 to 6 months (30 minutes per session, 2 times per week) HAL training with walker and supported by physical therapists. Functional outcome measures included 10-m walk test(10MWT), 6-minute walk test(6MWT), Berg balance scale(BBS), and the walking index for SCIII(WISCIII), which were evaluated without HAL. Results Twelve patients completed 3 to 6 months HAL training (3 patients dropped out after 6 or 8 sessions). Functional outcome measures were analyzed in those who completed HAL training. The mean walking speed in 10MWT increased from 0.46 +/- 0.37 m/s to 0.73 +/- 0.50 m/s (p<0.01). The improvement corresponded to a 59% faster walking than in initial evaluation. Walking distance in 6MWT increased from 127.8 +/- 112.7m to 217.5 +/- 159.1m (p<0.05). Balance evaluated by BBS also improved from 28.1 +/- 13.4 to 39.8 +/- 11.8 (p<0.01), and WISCIII from 13.8 +/- 5.1 to 17.0 +/- 2.6 (p<0.05). Discussion and Conclusion Our results suggest that HAL training could improve walking ability and balance in individuals with chronic SCI. In the past, rehabilitation for SCI focused not on functional improvement, but on compensation for impairment. HAL would facilitate motor recovery and improve mobility in chronic SCI, and may play an important role in rehabilitation for SCI in future. Further controlled studies should be needed. It is very important that people who are in need of assistive products utilise those products in their daily life. In the first part of this symposium a keynote lecture will be made by a Japanese opinion leader who is an AT development director of a national institute, and is recommended by The Rehabilitation Engineering Society of Japan (RESJA). He will talk about the current situation of assistive products development and use in Japan which is the most aged society in the world. In his speech a research project is introduced which focuses relationship of assistive products use and daily activities of older people including nonagenarians and centenarians. A panel discussion will be held in the second part of the symposium. Remarkable panelists from WHO and Japan make short presentations about the circumstances of people with disabilities or the elders and usage status of assistive products in Southeast Asian and other countries. After the short reports, the organisers from WHO and NRCPD develop discussions with the panelists about better practice of AT use or methods to improve access to high-quality affordable AT. Statement of the objective / learning objectives The aim is to bring deeper understanding among opinion leaders in P&O / Assistive Technology fields. The audience can learn the current situations of AT and be inspired to support AT development and dissemination. The Symposium 'Assistive Technologies against Ageing Society' on Sunday, 6 October 2019, consists of two presentations with the first one taking place from 13:00 - 14:15 and the second one continuing from 14:30 - 15:45. Background The Australian Orthotic Prosthetic Association (AOPA) regulates the profession of orthotist/prosthetists in Australia through the establishment, maintenance and application of professional standards, such as competency standards. While portfolios are commonly used to assess professional competency, little research has investigated how reliable these assessments are, or how reliability can be improved. Aim To evaluate how reliable AOPA's competency portfolio assessment is and examine causes of variation to improve reliability. Method Overseas trained practitioners wishing to have their qualifications and experience recognised by AOPA submitted a portfolio for assessment. Portfolios were randomly assigned to two independent assessors who determined whether the applicant's portfolio demonstrates competency against each of the 68 AOPA Competency Standards (2014) and recorded their determination as "satisfied" or "not satisfied". An administrator collated the independent evaluations and identified any points of disagreement for discussion at a consensus meeting. To quantify interassessor reliability, the Kappa statistic was used for each of the 68 competency standards. To better understand the reasons for disagreement, semi-structured interviews were conducted with each assessor. Results Results from this study show high rates of agreement between assessors upon independent assessment. Points of disagreement were commonly resolved during the consensus meeting between assessors, disagreement was rare. The standards which experienced the highest rates of disagreement were identified. Discussion and Conclusion Evidence based standards should be supported by evidence-based processes. Competency assessment via a portfolio of evidence can be conducted and assessed by two assessors with high levels of agreement. Factors that may increase the reliability of the assessment include; appropriate assessor training, the presence of a consensus meeting and clear standards. There are opportunities to further improve the clarity of standards identified as having the lowest level of agreement. Background Evidence highlights that a major factor associated with inappropriate wheelchair distribution is the global shortage of wheelchair service provision education and training.[1-4] The World Health Organization Guidelines on the provision of manual wheelchairs in less-resourced settingsrecommend integrating wheelchair service provision content into existing academic rehabilitation programs.[1] However, a 2017 study reported limited training time allocated to wheelchair service provision in some professional rehabilitation programs in low-, middle- and high-income countries.(4) Aim To develop an evidence-based online Seating and Mobility Academic Resource Toolkit (SMART) through a mixed-methods approach to identify necessary components and investigate preliminary impact. Method Data was collected from 3 primary data sources, including an international wheelchair education survey, qualitative interview transcripts with representatives from health care professional university programs and wheelchair education integration 'pilot sites'. Data sources were analyzed using a deductive content analysis approach to produce the Seating and Mobility Academic Resource Toolkit (SMART). Subsequent analyses of SMART analytics and purposive interviews were performed to identify how the toolkit was used in a variety of settings across different types of academic rehabilitation programs and contexts. Results We received 72 responses on our international wheelchair education survey, conducted 14 qualitative interviews with health care professional university program representatives, and hosted 16 presentations from wheelchair education integration 'pilot sites' to identify integration challenges. Themes emerged related to having minimal resources (human, financial, clinical, equipment), unawareness of open-source educational materials, and lack of trained personnel to name a few. Therefore, SMART was developed and includes educational resources (e.g., syllabi, presentations, online modules, evidence-based training packages, labs, evaluations) and strategies to overcome barriers to integrating wheelchair content into curricula. Analytics reveal SMART pages have been accessed 11,703 times globally, and since its launch in April 2018, the average number of pages viewed per session have increased by 7.4%. The interview findings suggest SMART has potential to improve the wheelchair education provided in terms of pedagogic approach, content and resources used. Discussion and Conclusion SMART may facilitate the integration of wheelchair content into health care professional university curricula. Ultimately, improved education in this important area of practice may enhance the participation and quality of life of those individuals who use a wheelchair for mobility. Prosthetics and orthotics training programs may consider using globally available resources, such as SMART, to identify strategies to improve wheelchair education and to advocate for their implementation. Background Nowadays is well known that voice-activated wheelchairs help the quadriplegic get around, and houses can be equipped with similar systems to operate lights and appliances; but which are the options when besides quadriplegic there is no way to give voice commands to the wheelchair or to communicate our desires to other people. The first approach of this project was presented in the International Workshop on Wearable Robotics (WeRob 2014) and a new version in WeRob 2017[2]. Aim Provide an alternative to quadriplegic persons in order to give commands from eye blinking and communicate with outside world through Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities incorporated in a wheelchair. Method To fulfill the aim of the project, the engineering design method was followed which as first step includes the definition of a clear problem statement, then pertinent information was gathered in order to generate multiple solutions. Afterwards, the information was analyzed, a solution was selected, tested and implemented. Two approaches have been generated previously (WeRob 2014, 2017), the first one was developed with a neural signal reading device and a Bluetooth communication board; afterwards a new alternative was evaluated including eye blinking commands. Now, a faster microcontroller with IoT capabilities has been incorporated in the design process to include IoT capabilities. Results Taking a decision considering commands coming from eye blinking, to give mobility to a wheelchair, is not a simple task, bad decisions can end up in moving a person in a wrong direction which will give more difficulties instead of solutions. In the actual study a faster microcontroller with embedded software and hardware for IoT is used, this device can manage multiple sensors as inputs and multiple actuators as outputs. The raspberry Pi 3 was selected because it is single-board computer with wireless LAN and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) on board. The developed system discriminates an involuntary blinking from a low motion voluntary blinking and take a decision to move forward a model wheelchair. The position and given commands are sent to an IoT platform to save the wheelchair movement data. Discussion and Conclusion A single board computer with on board wireless LAN and Bluetooth gives more possibilities to incorporate IoT capabilities for decision-making about wheelchair movement, and besides that voluntary blinking recognition is detected with precision and faster. The developed system fulfils the aim to provide an alternative to quadriplegic persons in order to give commands from eye blinking and communicate with outside world through IoT capabilities incorporated in a wheelchair. Background Most cervical cord injury (CCI) people need to use a wheelchair in daily life [1]. Especially, C5-C6 level of CCI patients can't usually perform the extension movement of elbow joint so that they can't operate the wheelchair strongly. Previously, we have developed the motion assist robot, which is named Active Cast (AC) for the upper limbs to transmit their residual function around shoulder to hand operations [2]. Aim The purpose of this study is to clarify the influence of wearing AC on the musculoskeletal of their residual function during wheelchair operation by people with different symptoms of CCI. Method Two subjects with C6B1(right), C5B(left) and C6B2(both) of the Zancolli classification were participated in this evaluation experiment. The treadmill was set to reproduce the running on a slope. The inclination was set to 3% for the C5 level CCI subject, and 4% for the C6 level CCI subject in order to confirm that the musculoskeletal of their residual functions better. We used the 3D motion analysis system and a myoelectric potentiometer for the analysis during 20 [s] wheelchair operation. From the above, the effect of AC on residual muscles of CCI subjects with different symptoms was analyzed. Results Based on the experimental results without AC, we confirmed that the C5 level subject operated the wheelchair using the elbow flexion force, and the C6 level subject used the force of the pronation of forearm. On the other hand, from the results with AC, in the case of C5 level subject, the scapula elevated greatly due to locking the elbow joint, and the amount of activity of the upper trapezius muscle also increased comparing with the case without AC. In the case of C6 level subject, we confirmed that the amount of scapula abduction increased, and the serratus anterior muscle was also exerted. Discussion and Conclusion It was revealed that wearing AC induced motions and residual muscles around the shoulder of CCI subjects with different symptoms. In C5 level CCI, it was confirmed that the elevation movement of the scapula was induced, and in the C6 level CCI, the abduction motion of the scapula was induced. It was confirmed that the effect of AC differs by symptoms with the pronation of forearm. Background Patients with complete paraplegia after spinal cord injury (SCI) are difficult to walk by themselves. Gait training with conventional orthoses for complete paraplegia requires excessive upper limb usage and is difficult to train knee extensor during ambulation. We developed a new method of HAL using remaining muscle activation as a trigger for paralyzed limb, and we called heterotopic HAL method (T-HAL). Aim This study aims to describe voluntary gait and voluntary knee extension using Heterotopic Triggered HAL method in patients with complete quadri/paraplegia after chronic SCI. Method Nine patients, 20-67 years old, C6-T11, AIS A-B, were enrolled in this study. HAL session consisted of two parts: the first session was voluntary ambulation using upper limb triggered HAL (UT-HAL method). In addition, for cases who could contract hip flexor, the second session was done for active knee extension using hip flexor activation. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to evaluate muscle activity of hip flexor and quadriceps femoris (Quad) in synchronization with a Vicon motion capture system. The modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score was evaluated before and after each session. Results There were not seen severe complications such as hypoautonomic hyperreflexia, or symptomatic venous vein thrombosis, etc. The only observed adverse event was redness caused by contact between the skin and harness in cases 1, 2, and 3 which was avoidable by using a cushion. In three cases, from C6 to T6, MAS score significantly decreased after each session. In all cases, EMG before the intervention showed no activation in either Quad. However, periodic activation of the lower limb muscles was seen during UT-HAL ambulation. In two cases, in T10-11, there was observed active contraction in both Quads and hip flexors after intervention. Discussion and Conclusion We focused on residual upper limb muscle activity and the coordination between the upper limbs and contralateral lower limbs in natural gait. We observed neurological positive changes in two cases after the intervention. Moreover, patients with cervical cord or upper thoracic cord injuries, who have difficulty performing conventional gait training with orthoses, may experience decreased spasticity and activation of paralyzed muscles. These findings suggest that T-HAL method is a feasible option for rehabilitation for complete quadri/paraplegia with chronic SCI. Background Using a seat cushion, we feel the situation where the protrusion of the ischium hits the bottom of the cushion. At the pressure measuring time, the phenomenon that the peak pressure value gradually increases is observed. In prevention of pressure sores, it is important to elucidate the mechanism of bottoming phenomenon. The pressure distribution response characteristics when continuously using various seat cushions were studied in the human body and human body model. Aim It was aimed to investigate whether the bottom was due to a change in the condition in the seat cushion or a change in the internal pressure in the human body. Method Seven seat cushions were prepared on the wheelchair. Subjects were two healthy adult male and a biological model. The biological model was made from plastic bone specimens and silicone materials (170 cm, 32 kg). Each cushion was placed on the plate seating surface of a wheelchair (Netti em, Alu Rehab AS) set at a tilt angle of 0 degrees and a reclining angle of 95 degrees, and a pressure distribution measuring device was laid on top(Xsensor X 3 Pro, Xsensor Technology Corp.). Measurements were carried out, with the human body and human body model sitting still at the pelvis intermediate position, randomly on each seat cushion (3 minutes / 4861 frames). Results In each seat cushion, there was a gradual trend of peak pressure after sitting of the human body. On the other hand, this tendency was not observed in the human body model. The difference between the maximum and the minimum value of the peak pressure was significantly higher for each human body than for the human body model. There was no significant difference between the maximum and minimum values of the contact area between human body and human body model. Discussion and Conclusion Local concentration of pressure can not be said to be caused by sinking of humans in the seat cushion or compression of the material. Rather, it is presumed that biological changes occur over time. If compressive stress affects blood flow, in order to distribute body pressure, wheelchair users are required to improve the movement such as push-up and use the wheelchair posture conversion function. Background We are developing Qolo, a new personal mobility device for those with motor disability in their lower limbs. It assists sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit postural transitions as well as navigation in standing posture with hands-free operation. Its mechanism to assist the postural transition is implemented with passive gas springs without using electric actuators, making it compact, light-weight and low cost. Aim The purpose of this study is to report clinical assessment of the device after modification of its design to realize voluntary sit-to-stand posture transition of people with thoracic level spinal cord injury (SCI). Method In the improved design of the device, reviewing our preceding clinical experiments, the assistive force of the knee springs was doubled and lumbar assist was added. Six participants with SCI (age: 30-52y, 4 males and 3 females, neurological level: T4-L3, AIS: A-C, MMT Hip Ext.: 0-1, Knee Ext.: 0-3) were asked to conduct stand-up and sit-down postural transitions using the improved version of the device. Feasibility of the assisted motions were evaluated. Results Six out of the seven participants were able to smoothly conduct voluntary stand-up and sit-down motions using the device by themselves, without additional assistance. Two of the them (T10A, T6A, MMT Knee<=1) achieved voluntary stand-up motion only with the improved version of the device. One participant (T4A, MMT Knee=0) needed additional manual assistance to achieve voluntary stand-up motion using the device. Discussion and Conclusion The improvement of the device extended its capability to assist sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit posture transition of people with lumbar or thoracic level SCI. At the same time, necessity of stronger support for middle to upper thoracic level SCI was investigated. For the next step, we plan to introduce stronger assistive force, and improve of harnessing and attachment and detachment processes to facilitate its daily use. Background Gait enables human beings to move forward, and most people consider gait to be natural skill. But gait disturbances are very prevalent to the patients with burn injury. A major cause of functional impairment including pain and joint contractures. Contractures at the lower extremities such as the hip, knee and ankle significantly limit gait. Recent attention of the application of artificial intelligence in rehabilitation, in particularly lower limbs robot assisted rehabilitation has become a hot issue of studies. Aim This study is purposed to find the efficacy and study the mechanism of motor recovery after robot assisted gait training on patients with lower extremity burn. Method 7 patients with lower extremity burn were included. All patients received 4 weeks robot assisted training. Functional scores of functional ambulation category (FAC) and 6-minute walking distances, and pain score of visual analog score (VAS) during robot assisted gait training were measured. Results FAC and VAS scores after training were better than the scores before training. 6-min walking distance after training were significantly increased than the measure before training(p<0.05). Lower limbs robot assisted rehabilitation training improves patient's pain, and increases walking speed on patients with lower extremity burn. Discussion and Conclusion Lower limbs robot assisted rehabilitation improves the walking speed, and prolongs their walking distances. The use of robot assisted rehabilitation may facilitate early recovery from burn injury. Background The infant cerebral palsy is one of the most wide-spread reasons of disability at child's age. The success of rehabilitation depends on intensity of kinesitherapy, quality of movements and motivation of the child that is ensured with modern robotized systems with biological feedback. Aim to estimate efficiency of use of robotized systems with biological feedback in rehabilitation of children with infant cerebral palsy. Method The basic and control groups of children (26 persons in each) with spastic paraparesis, flexion positioning of lower extremities, impairment of supportability and walking, matched in functions, age and gender were formed. The course of rehabilitation included: massage, apparatus physiotherapy, therapeutic exercises. The patients of the basic group additionally had mechanotherapy on a robotized system "Lokomat Pediatric" for training strength of muscle, for increasing of amount of movements in joints. The period of observation - 1 year (3 courses of treatment). Efficiency of the given treatment was evaluated with a method of functional testing (Ashworth, GMFCS, GMFM), program testing of a robotized system (L-FORCE, L-ROM) before and after the course of rehabilitation. Results For the period of observation the spasticity of muscles (Ashworth) of lower extremities in patients of both groups reduced, on the average, for 1 point. The level of limitation of the gross motor functions (GMFCS) in both groups didn't change essentially. Motor possibilities (GMFM) of the patients of the basic group increased, on the average, on 25 +/- 7 %, of the control group - on 12 +/- 7 %. The isometric strength of muscles - flexors of a knee and a hip (L-FORCE) in the basic group increased, on the average, on 3 Nm, the strength of muscles-extensors of a knee and a hip - on 2 Nm, in the control group - didn't change. The amount of active movements in knee and hip joints (L-ROM) achieved physiological norm in the basic group and in 25 % of children of the control group. Discussion and Conclusion The mechanotherapy on a robotized system with biological feedback "Lokomat Pediatric" in rehabilitation of children with infant cerebral palsy allows to increase the strength of muscles trained, amount of movements in joints, results in improvement of indexes of functional testing, to increase motivation of children for performing active exercises in game. Motor rehabilitation of patients with infant cerebral palsy with the use of mechanotherapy on a robotized system "Lokomat Pediatric" has shown high efficiency in comparison with traditional methods.					de Jager, Aimee/AAL-1264-2021						661	1	1	32	212	WOLTERS KLUWER HEALTH	Philadelphia	2001 Market St., Philadelphia, PA, UNITED STATES	0309-3646	1746-1553		PROSTHET ORTHOT INT	Prosthet.
