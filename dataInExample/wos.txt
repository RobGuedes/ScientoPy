Selcuk; Nojoumian, Mehrdad			Privacy-preserving protocols for secure and reliable data aggregation in IoT-enabled Smart Metering systems	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Internet of things; Privacy-preserving protocols; Reliable data aggregation; Secure multiparty computation; Fully homomorphic encryption; Smart Metering systems	GRIDS; INFORMATION; SCHEME; MODEL	As the Internet of Things (IoT) gets more pervasive, its areas of usage expands. Smart Metering systems is such an IoT-enabled technology that enables convenient and high frequency data collection compared to existing metering systems. However, such a frequent data collection puts the consumers' privacy in risk as it helps expose the consumers' daily habits. Secure in-network data aggregation can be used to both preserve consumers' privacy and reduce the packet traffic due to high frequency metering data. The privacy can be provided by performing the aggregation on concealed metering data. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and secure multiparty computation (secure MPC) are the systems that enable performing multiple operations on concealed data. However, both FHE and secure MPC systems have some overhead in terms of data size or message complexity. The overhead is compounded in the IoT-enabled networks such as Smart Grid (SG) Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). In this paper, we propose new protocols to adapt FHE and secure MPC to be deployed in SG AMI networks that are formed using wireless mesh networks. The proposed protocols conceal the smart meters' (SMs) reading data by encrypting it (FHE) or computing its shares on a randomly generated polynomial (secure MPC). The encrypted data computed shares are aggregated at some certain aggregator SM(s) up to the gateway of the network in a hierarchical manner without revealing the readings' actual value. To assess their performance, we conducted extensive experiments using the ns-3 network simulator. The simulation results indicate that the secure MPC-based protocol can be a viable privacy-preserving data aggregation mechanism since it not only reduces the overhead with respect to FHE but also almost matches the performance of the Paillier cryptosystem when it is used within a proper sized AMI network.

In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining,etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare loT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof of-concept design demonstrates an loT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.

J	Dhillon, PK; Kalra, S				Dhillon, Parwinder Kaur; Kalra, Sheetal			Secure multi-factor remote user authentication scheme for Internet of Things environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						biometrics; IoT; key agreement; remote user authentication; security	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME; ELLIPTIC-CURVES CRYPTOGRAPHY; HEALTH-CARE; MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION; SMART CARD; PROTOCOL; IOT; ARCHITECTURE; SYSTEMS	Because of the exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT), several services are being developed. These services can be accessed through smart gadgets by the user at any place, every time and anywhere. This makes security and privacy central to IoT environments. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust, and multi-factor remote user authentication and key agreement scheme for IoT environments. Using this protocol, any authorized user can access and gather real-time sensor data from the IoT nodes. Before gaining access to any IoT node, the user must first get authenticated by the gateway node as well as the IoT node. The proposed protocol is based on XOR and hash operations, and includes: (i) a 3-factor authentication (ie, password, biometrics, and smart device); (ii) mutual authentication; (iii) shared session key; and (iv) key freshness. It satisfies desirable security attributes and maintains acceptable efficiency in terms of the computational overheads for resource constrained IoT environment. Further, the informal and formal security analysis using AVISPA proves security strength of the protocol and its robustness against all possible security threats. Simulation results also prove that the scheme is secure against attacks.

J	Kua, J; Nguyen, SH; Armitage, G; Branch, P				Kua, Jonathan; Nguyen, Suong H.; Armitage, Grenville; Branch, Philip			Using Active Queue Management to Assist IoT Application Flows in Home Broadband Networks	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Active queue management (AQM); first-in-firstout (FIFO); home broadband networks; Internet of Things (IoT)	TECHNOLOGIES; CHALLENGES	Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as telehealth, smart appliances, and smart energy are becoming more common within the home. However, they must compete for bandwidth with traditional applications such as video streaming, video conferencing, and bulk file transfers. Such competition can be detrimental to the IoT applications when home gateways use traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue management. Simply increasing bandwidth between the home gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP), even when possible, provides no guarantee of bandwidth for IoT applications since many traditional applications will consume as much bandwidth as is available. In this paper, we explore whether active queue management (AQM), now being implemented in home gateways, can provide protection for IoT flows. We investigate the effect of different AQM algorithms deployed at the home gateway in scenarios with multiple concurrent application flows. We find that deploying multiqueue FlowQueue Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) or the hybrid FlowQueue Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (FQ-PIE) at the home gateway can provide excellent capacity sharing, flow isolation, and good protection in terms of throughput and queuing delays for IoT flows and other applications, which cannot be achieved with traditional FIFO or other single-queue AQMs such as Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE).

J	Derhamy, H; Eliasson, J; Delsing, J				Derhamy, Hasan; Eliasson, Jens; Delsing, Jerker			IoT Interoperability-On-Demand and Low Latency Transparent Multiprotocol Translator	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Arrowhead; industrial automation; Internet of Things (IoT); interoperability; multiprotocol translation; protocol conversion; service-oriented architecture (SOA)		In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) there is a clear need for a high level of interoperability between independently developed systems, often from different vendors. Traditional methods of interoperability including protocol gateways and adapters are often used at the network layer. Recent work on application interoperability has emphasized the use of middleware or protocol proxy/gateway. However, middleware tends to move the interoperability problem rather than solving it, and there are scalability issues with increasing the number of proxies, reconfiguration effort, and required bandwidth and processing overheads. This paper proposes a secure, on-demand, and transparent protocol translator for the IIoT. Targeting the challenge of interoperability between Internet protocol-based communication protocols, this paper analyzes current solutions and develops a set of requirements to be met by IoT protocol interoperability. The proposed protocol translator is not a middleware, it is a service-oriented architecture-based participant, it is used on-demand when needed, it does not introduce design time dependencies, it operates transparently, it supports low-latency, and it is secured through the use of Arrowhead authorization and authentication.

J	Al-Kaseem, BR; Al-Raweshidy, HS				Al-Kaseem, Bilal R.; Al-Raweshidy, Hamed S.			SD-NFV as an Energy Efficient Approach for M2M Networks Using Cloud-Based 6LoWPAN Testbed	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Cloud computing; customized SD-NFV; energy efficiency; IoT; M2M; NFV; SDN; 6LoWPAN testbed		Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is the leading technology for realising the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The M2M sensor nodes are characterized by low-power and low-data rates devices which have increased exponentially over the years. IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) is the first protocol that provides IPv6 connectivity to the wireless M2M sensor nodes. Having a tremendous number of M2M sensor nodes execute independent control decision leads to difficulty in network control and management. In addition, these evergrowing devices generate massive traffic and cause energy scarcity, which affects the M2M sensor node lifetime. Recently, software defined-networking (SDN) and network functioning virtualization (NFV) are being used in M2M sensor networks to add programmability and flexibility features in order to adopt the exponential increment in wireless M2M traffic and enable network configuration even after deployment. This paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation which aims to analyze how SDN, NFV, and cloud computing can interact together in the 6LoWPAN gateway to provide simplicity and flexibility in network management. The proposed approach is called customized software defined-NFV (SD-NFV), and has been tested and verified by implementing a real-time 6LoWPAN testbed. The experimental results indicated that the SD-NFV approach reduced the network discovery time by 60% and extended the node's lifetime by 65% in comparison to the traditional 6LoWPAN network. The implemented testbed has one sink which is the M2M 6LoWPAN gateway where the network coordinator and the SDN controller are executed. There are many possible ways to implement 6LoWPAN testbed but limited are based on open standards development boards (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Beagle Bones). In the current testbed, the Arduino board is chosen and the SDN controller is customized and written using C++ language to fit the 6LoWPAN network requirements. Finally, SDN and NFV have been envisioned as the most promising techniques to improve network programmability, simplicity, and management in cloud-based 6LoWPAN gateway.

J	Petracca, M; Passaro, P; Gioia, E				Petracca, Matteo; Passaro, Pierluigi; Gioia, Egidio			AMBER: Advanced Mother Board for Embedded systems pRototyping	EURASIP JOURNAL ON EMBEDDED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Embedded system design; Fast prototyping; Industrial internet of things; IIoT gateway design		The proliferation of low-cost embedded system platforms has allowed the creation of large communities of developers, as well as the development of new advanced applications. Even though some of these applications can be of industrial relevance, their immediate application to real products is not straightforward since most of them require a complete and expensive hardware redesign of the considered embedded solution. To speed up the technological transfer of custom embedded solutions while overtaking the limits imposed by a complete hardware redesign, the article presents AMBER, an innovative embedded platform leveraging on a design based on System-on-Modules (SOM) and Extender modules. AMBER decouples the processing part of the system, which is fully contained on the SOM, from the peripherals, which are contained on the main board and Extender modules. This allows a smooth industrialoriented redesign of the embedded solution. In the article, AMBER is first presented starting from its philosophy and design choices while highlighting its main features. Then, an application of AMBER as an enhanced gateway to be used in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario is reported by considering a monitoring and actuation use case.

In an IoT fog computing system, three elements can be distinguished: IoT nodes that collect data, the cloud, and interconnected IoT gateways that exchange messages with the IoT nodes and with the cloud. This article focuses on securing IoT gateways, which are assumed to be constrained in terms of computational resources, but that are able to offload some processing from the cloud and to reduce the latency in the responses to the IoT nodes. However, it is usually taken for granted that IoT gateways have direct access to the electrical grid, which is not always the case: in mission-critical applications like natural disaster relief or environmental monitoring, it is common to deploy IoT nodes and gateways in large areas where electricity comes from solar or wind energy that charge the batteries that power every device. In this article, how to secure IoT gateway communications while minimizing power consumption is analyzed. The throughput and power consumption of Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are considered, since they are really popular, but have not been thoroughly analyzed when applied to IoT scenarios. Moreover, the most widespread Transport Layer Security (TLS) cipher suites use RSA as the main public key-exchange algorithm, but the key sizes needed are not practical for most IoT devices and cannot be scaled to high security levels. In contrast, ECC represents a much lighter and scalable alternative. Thus, RSA and ECC are compared for equivalent security levels, and power consumption and data throughput are measured using a testbed of IoT gateways. The measurements obtained indicate that, in the specific fog computing scenario proposed, ECC is clearly a much better alternative than RSA, obtaining energy consumption reductions of up to 50% and a data throughput that doubles RSA in most scenarios. These conclusions are then corroborated by a frame temporal analysis of Ethernet packets. In addition, current data compression algorithms are evaluated, concluding that, when dealing with the small payloads related to IoT applications, they do not pay off in terms of real data throughput and power consumption.

However, most LPWAN solutions like SIGFOX (TM) or LoRaWAN (TM) rely on star topology networks, where stations (STAs) transmit directly to the gateway (GW), which often leads to rapid battery depletion in STAs located far from it. In this work, we analyze the impact on LPWANs energy consumption of multi-hop communication in the uplink, allowing STAs to transmit data packets in lower power levels and higher data rates to closer parent STAs, reducing their energy consumption consequently. To that aim, we introduce the Distance-Ring Exponential Stations Generator (DRESG) framework,(1) designed to evaluate the performance of the so-called optimal-hop routing model, which establishes optimal routing connections in terms of energy efficiency, aiming to balance the consumption among all the STAs in the network. Results show that enabling such multi-hop connections entails higher network lifetimes, reducing significantly the bottleneck consumption in LPWANs with up to thousands of STAs. These results lead to foresee multi-hop communication in the uplink as a promising routing alternative for extending the lifetime of LPWAN deployments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These applications require a reconfigurable sensor architecture that can span multiple scenarios, devices and use cases that allow storage, networking and computational resources to be efficiently used on the edge of the network. There are a number of platforms and gateway architectures that have been proposed to manage these components and enable application deployment. These approaches lack horizontal integration between multiple providers as well as higher order functionalities like load balancing and clustering. This is partly due to the strongly coupled nature of the deployed applications, a lack of abstraction of device communication layers as well as a lock-in for communication protocols. This limitation is a major obstacle for the development of a protocol agnostic application environment that allows for single application to be migrated and to work with multiple peripheral devices with varying protocols from different local gateways. This research looks at existing platforms and their shortcomings as well as proposes a messaging based modular gateway platform that enables clustering of gateways and the abstraction of peripheral communication protocol details. These novelties allow applications to send and receive messages regardless of their deployment location and destination device protocol, creating a more uniform development environment. Furthermore, it results in a more streamlined application development and testing while providing more efficient use of the gateway's resources. Our evaluation of a prototype for the system shows the need for the migration of resources and the QoS advantages of such a system. The examined use case scenarios show that clustering proves to be an advantage in certain use cases as well as presenting the deployment of a larger testing and control environment through the platform.

J	Aranzazu-Suescun, C; Cardei, M				Aranzazu-Suescun, Catalina; Cardei, Mihaela			Distributed Algorithms for Event Reporting in Mobile-Sink WSNs for Internet of Things	TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						composite events; distributed algorithm; energy efficiency; event-based clustering; Internet of Things; mobile sink; wireless sensor networks	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; ENERGY-EFFICIENT; PROTOCOL; SCHEME; IOT	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have many applications, such as climate monitoring systems, fire detection, smart homes, and smart cities. It is expected that WSNs will be integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT)and participate in various tasks. WSNs play an important role monitoring and reporting environment information and collecting surrounding context. In this paper we consider a WSN deployed for an application such as environment monitoring, and a mobile sink which acts as the gateway between the Internet and the WSN. Data gathering is a challenging problem in WSNs and in the IoT because the information has to be available quickly and effectively without delays and redundancies. In this paper we propose several distributed algorithms for composite event detection and reporting to a mobile sink. Once data is collected by the sink, it can be shared using the IoT infrastructure. We analyze the performance of our algorithms using WSNet simulator, which is specially designed for event-based WSNs. We measure various metrics such as average residual energy, percentage of composite events processed successfully at the sink, and the average number of hops to reach the sink.

J	Chung, H; Park, J; Lee, S				Chung, Hyunji; Park, Jungheum; Lee, Sangjin			Digital forensic approaches for Amazon Alexa ecosystem	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Internet of Things; Cloud-based IoT; Intelligent virtual assistant (IVA); Amazon Alexa; Amazon Echo; Cloud native forensics; Client centric forensics; CIFT	DATA REMNANTS	Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as the Amazon Echo - a smart speaker developed by Amazon - are undoubtedly great sources of potential digital evidence due to their ubiquitous use and their always-on mode of operation, constituting a human-life's black box. The Amazon Echo in particular plays a centric role for the cloud-based intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) Alexa developed by Amazon Lab126. The Alexa-enabled wireless smart speaker is the gateway for all voice commands submitted to Alexa. Moreover, the IVA interacts with a plethora of compatible IoT devices and third-party applications that leverage cloud resources. Understanding the complex cloud ecosystem that allows ubiquitous use of Alexa is paramount on supporting digital investigations when need raises. This paper discusses methods for digital forensics pertaining to the IVA Alexa's ecosystem. The primary contribution of this paper consists of a new efficient approach of combining cloud-native forensics with client-side forensics (forensics for companion devices), to support practical digital investigations. Based on a deep understanding of the targeted ecosystem, we propose a proof-of-concept tool, CIFT, that supports identification, acquisition and analysis of both native artifacts from the cloud and client-centric artifacts from local devices (mobile applications and web browsers).

The GRAFCET is then used to model the individual functional modules and the hierarchical behavior of the system. The behavior of each module is represented as a sequential-concurrent hybrid discrete event system. We apply high-level synthesis rules to generate a VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL)-target efficient hardware for a smart sensor controller and smart gateway controller. Finally, these embedded hardware controllers are generated automatically to integrate all intelligent functional modules into a complex embedded system, and a hardware circuit is then synthesized. The experimental results show that the hardware circuit can meet the definition of an SSN system for Industrial Internet of Things applications. Moreover, this methodology enables a coherent design quality, short design period, low development cost, and short time-to-market for complex industrial applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, designing a secure and reliable authentication scheme for WSNs that can be deployed in IoT remains a research and operational challenge. For example, recently in 2016, Amin and Biswas showed that the Turcanovic et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to smart card loss attack, user impersonation attack, etc. They then proposed a new authentication scheme for WSNs with multi-gateway. In this paper, we revisit the scheme of Amin and Biswas and reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities in the scheme (i.e. sensor capture attack, user forgery attack, gateway forgery attack, sensor forgery attack and off-line guessing attack). In addition, we demonstrate that the user in the scheme can be tracked due to the use of a constant pseudo-identity and previously established session keys can be calculated by the attacker. Rather than attempting to fix a broken scheme, we present a novel authentication scheme for multi-gateway based WSNs. We then demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme using Proverif, as well as evaluating the good performance of the scheme using NS-2 simulation.

J	Tai, WL; Chang, YF; Li, WH				Tai, Wei-Liang; Chang, Ya-Fen; Li, Wei-Han			An IoT notion-based authentication and key agreement scheme ensuring user anonymity for heterogeneous ad hoc wireless sensor networks	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Iot; Wireless sensor network; Authentication Key agreement; Integrity	MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION; ENVIRONMENTS; PROTOCOL	In 2014, Turkanovic et al. applied the Internet of Things (IoT) notion to wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and proposed a user authentication and key agreement scheme for heterogeneous ad hoc wireless sensor networks with lightweight computational operations. In 2015, Chang et al. find that Turkanovic et al.'s scheme possesses two drawbacks that can be overcome with simple modification. After further analyzing Turkanovic et al.'s scheme, we find that their scheme suffers from two fatal security flaws. First, user anonymity is not provided as claimed. Second, an attacker can obtain the session key shared between a normal sensor node and the user who has ever connected to a compromised sensor node. In this paper, we explicitly show the found security flaws and propose an improvement by taking the following into consideration: (1) user anonymity, (2) no complex computations, (3) mutual authentication between any two of a gateway node, a sensor node, and the user, (4) user friendly, and (5) ensuring the correctness of the session key earlier.

It is intended to be used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving battery-powered devices with low throughput requirements. A LoRaWAN network consists of multiple end nodes that communicate with one or more gateways. These gateways act like a transparent bridge towards a common network server. The amount of end devices and their throughput requirements will have an impact on the performance of the LoRaWAN network. This study investigates the scalability in terms of the number of end devices per gateway of single-gateway LoRaWAN deployments. First, we determine the intra-technology interference behavior with two physical end nodes, by checking the impact of an interfering node on a transmitting node. Measurements show that even under concurrent transmission, one of the packets can be received under certain conditions. Based on these measurements, we create a simulation model for assessing the scalability of a single gateway LoRaWAN network. We show that when the number of nodes increases up to 1000 per gateway, the losses will be up to 32%. In such a case, pure Aloha will have around 90% losses. However, when the duty cycle of the application layer becomes lower than the allowed radio duty cycle of 1%, losses will be even lower. We also show network scalability simulation results for some IoT use cases based on real data.

However, the further flourishing of e-/m-healthcare still faces many challenges including information security and privacy preservation. To address these problems, a healthcare system (HES) framework is designed that collects medical data from WBANs, transmits them through an extensive wireless sensor network infrastructure, and finally, publishes them into wireless personal-area networks via a gateway. Furthermore, HES involves the groups of send-receive model scheme to realize key distribution and secure data transmission, the homomorphic encryption based on matrix scheme to ensure privacy, and an expert system able to analyze the scrambled medical data and feedback the results automatically. Theoretical and experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the security, privacy, and improved performance of HES compared with current systems or schemes. Finally, the prototype implementation of HES is explored to verify its feasibility.

J	Singh, A; Awasthi, AK; Singh, K				Singh, Akansha; Awasthi, Amit K.; Singh, Karan			Cryptanalysis and Improvement in User Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for Wireless Sensor Network	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						WSN; Authentication; Key agreement; Network security	SECURITY	Turkanovic et al. (Ad Hoc Netw 20:96-112, 2014) proposed a user authentication and key agreement scheme based on the notion of the 'internet of things' for wireless sensor network. Authors claimed that their scheme is safe against various attacks. We found that this scheme fails against session key recovery attack. If an attacker has stolen the smartcard, he can easily obtain the session key generated between user and sensor node. In this paper, we shows that the attacker is able to compute the secret parameter , which is the used by a gateway during communication with others. Now the attacker can modify the first message that was send by the user to the sensor node. Finally, he breaks the complete system. We also provide few other insecurities and vulnerability to many attacks like offline password guessing attack, replay attack and impersonate attack etc. To remedy this, an enhanced scheme is also proposed to remove the flaws of the Turkanovic et al. scheme. The result and performance analysis of our proposed scheme shows that the new enhanced scheme provides high security with low computation, communication and storage overhead.

J	Georgiou, O; Raza, U				Georgiou, Orestis; Raza, Usman			Low Power Wide Area Network Analysis: Can LoRa Scale?	IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS			English	Article						Low power wide area networks; wireless communications; stochastic geometry; interference analysis; outage probability		Low power wide area (LPWA) networks are making spectacular progress from design, standardization, to commercialization. At this time of fast-paced adoption, it is of utmost importance to analyze how well these technologies will scale as the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things inevitably grows. In this letter, we provide a stochastic geometry framework for modeling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network, a leading LPWA technology. Our analysis formulates the unique peculiarities of LoRa, including its chirp spreadspectrum modulation technique, regulatory limitations on radio duty cycle, and use of ALOHA protocol on top, all of which are not as common in today's commercial cellular networks. We show that the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering signals using the same spreading sequence. We conclude that this fundamental limiting factor is perhaps more significant toward LoRa scalability than for instance spectrum restrictions. Our derivations for co-spreading factor interference found in LoRa networks enables rigorous scalability analysis of such networks.

Prefabricated construction enabled by the Internet-of-Things	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Internet of Things (IoT); BIM (Building Information Modelling); Multi-dimensional; Real-time; Visibility and traceability	MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; SAFETY; BIM; VISUALIZATION; TRACKING	Prefabricated construction has been used for public rental housing in Hong Kong. In order to speed up housing delivery, Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) have employed advanced technologies, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), in some of their pilot prefabrication-based construction projects. However, the information obtained from BIM and RFID is not well connected and shared among relevant stakeholders. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled BIM platform (MITBIMP) to achieve real-time visibility and traceability in prefabricated construction. Design considerations of a RFID Gateway Operating System, visibility and traceability tools, Data Source Interoperability Services, and decision support services are specified for developing the MITBIMP. A case study from a real-life construction project in Hong Kong is used as a pilot project to demonstrate advanced decision-making by using cutting-edge concepts and technologies within the MITBIMP to providing a basis for real-time visibility and traceability of the whole processes of prefabrication-based construction.

J	Guo, YG; Zhu, HB; Yang, LX				Guo, Yongan; Zhu, Hongbo; Yang, Longxiang			Smart Service Systern(SSS): A Novel Architecture Enabling Coordination of Heterogeneous Networking Technologies and Devices for Internet of Things	CHINA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Internet of Things; network architecture; clean slate; evolutionary approach; network heterogeneity; reconfiguration	FUTURE INTERNET; VIRTUALIZATION; DESIGN	In Internet of Things (IoT), the devices or terminals are connected with each other, which can be very diverse over the wireless networks. Unfortunately, the current devices are not designed to communicate with the collocated devices which employ different communication technologies. Consequently, the communication between these devices will be realized only by using the gateway nodes. This will cause the inefficient use of wireless resources. Therefore, in this paper, a smart service system(SSS) architecture is proposed, which consists of smart service terminal (SST), and smart service network (SSN), to realize the IoT in a general environment with diverse communication networks, devices, and services. The proposed architecture has the following advantages: i) the devices in this architecture cover multiple types of terminals and sensor-actuator devices; ii) the communications network therein is a converged network, and will coordinate multiple kinds of existing and emerging networks. This converged network offers ubiquitous access for various sensors and terminals; iii) the architecture has services and applications covering all smart service areas. It also provides the adaptability to new services and applications. A SSS architecture-based smart campus system was developed and deployed. Evaluation experiments of the proposed smart campus system demonstrate the SSS's advantages over the existing counterparts, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

J	Oh, S; Jang, JW				Oh, Sungmin; Jang, Ju Wook			A Scheme to Smooth Aggregated Traffic from Sensors with Periodic Reports	SENSORS			English	Article						Internet of Things (IoT); wireless IoT sensor; offset; scheduling; traffic aggregation	INTERNET; THINGS	The possibility of smoothing aggregated traffic from sensors with varying reporting periods and frame sizes to be carried on an access link is investigated. A straightforward optimization would take O(p(n)) time, whereas our heuristic scheme takes O(np) time where n, p denote the number of sensors and size of periods, respectively. Our heuristic scheme performs local optimization sensor by sensor, starting with the smallest to largest periods. This is based on an observation that sensors with large offsets have more choices in offsets to avoid traffic peaks than the sensors with smaller periods. A MATLAB simulation shows that our scheme excels the known scheme by M. Grenier et al. in a similar situation (aggregating periodic traffic in a controller area network) for almost all possible permutations. The performance of our scheme is very close to the straightforward optimization, which compares all possible permutations.

J	Kim, DY; Jung, M				Kim, Dae-Young; Jung, Minwoo			Data Transmission and Network Architecture in Long Range Low Power Sensor Networks for IoT	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Sensor network; IoT; Data transmission; Network architecture	INTERNET; THINGS	Internet of Things (IoT) becomes an inevitable technology for ICT convergence. It gathers information from various objects and provides intelligent services through analyzing the information. To collect surrounding information, IoT employs a sensor network, which is a low-power wireless communication network with numerous sensor nodes. Sensor nodes in conventional sensor networks have short transmission range. However, it is required a sensor network with long transmission range as well as low transmission power consumption for various IoT services. Long transmission range of IoT devices affects transmission environment. Lots of sensor nodes (i.e., IoT devices) in the long range sensor network transmit data to a given gateway node in order to deliver data to a network server. The gateway node can experience serious traffic load to relay the data. It causes to drop transmission efficiency. Therefore, for efficient data transmission, a network architecture and a data transmission method for long range IoT services are necessary. This paper proposes the network and data transmission architecture for the long range sensor networks. The proposed network architecture is based on oneM2M IoT standard. It has Infrastructure Node (IN), Middle Node (MN) and Application Service Node (ASN) as network elements. In the proposed method, IN employs cloned MNs to reduce the traffic load at the MN, which is the gateway. ASN delivers data through MN or cloned MNs to the IN. Through the load balancing by the proposed method at the MN, the efficient data transmission for IoT services in long range sensor networks can be provided. The performance of the proposed method is validated by the computer simulation.

Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile gateways	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Internet of Things; Interoperability; Interconnection; Smartphone-centric Computing; Smart Objects	BODY SENSOR NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK; INTERNET	In the near future, all our everyday things and objects will be both connected to the Internet and equipped with enough sensing, acting and processing capabilities to exploit the full potential benefits of the so called Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Even the simplest objects will become "smart" because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, highlevel and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.

J	Petrolo, R; Morabito, R; Loscri, V; Mitton, N				Petrolo, Riccardo; Morabito, Roberto; Loscri, Valeria; Mitton, Nathalie			The design of the gateway for the Cloud of Things	ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Cloud of Things; Distributed cloud computing; Sensor Networks; Internet of Things	INTERNET	The increasing momentum of the Internet of Things (IoT) leaded to the development of a huge number of applications in different domains. Those applications are based on different standards and protocols, making therefore the IoT landscape widely fragmented. In this context, the evolution of Web semantic technologies together with the popularity of Cloud computing represents a solution to enable the horizontal integration of various IoT applications and platforms. This is what the Cloud of Things (CoT) aims to achieve. In this paper, we propose the design of a gateway for the Cloud of Things. The proposed gateway is able to manage semantic-like things and at the same time to act as an end-point for the presentation of data to users. Moreover, thanks to the use of virtualized software-which introduces a negligible impact in terms of performance-the gateway enables a lightweight and dense deployment of services.

J	Cho, C; Choi, JY; Jeong, J; Chung, TM				Cho, Chulhee; Choi, Jae-Young; Jeong, Jongpil; Chung, Tai-Myoung			Performance Analysis of Inter-Domain Handoff Scheme Based on Virtual Layer in PMIPv6 Networks for IP-Based Internet of Things	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUPPORT	Lately, we see that Internet of things (IoT) is introduced in medical services for global connection among patients, sensors, and all nearby things. The principal purpose of this global connection is to provide context awareness for the purpose of bringing convenience to a patient's life and more effectively implementing clinical processes. In health care, monitoring of biosignals of a patient has to be continuously performed while the patient moves inside and outside the hospital. Also, to monitor the accurate location and biosignals of the patient, appropriate mobility management is necessary to maintain connection between the patient and the hospital network. In this paper, a binding update scheme on PMIPv6, which reduces signal traffic during location updates by Virtual LMA (VLMA) on the top original Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) Domain, is proposed to reduce the total cost. If a Mobile Node (MN) moves to a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)-located boundary of an adjacent LMA domain, the MN changes itself into a virtual mode, and this movement will be assumed to be a part of the VLMA domain. In the proposed scheme, MAGs eliminate global binding updates for MNs between LMA domains and significantly reduce the packet loss and latency by eliminating the handoff between LMAs. In conclusion, the performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme improves performance significantly versus PMIPv6 and HMIPv6 in terms of the binding update rate per user and average handoff latency.

J	Sahni, Y; Cao, JN; Zhang, SG; Yang, L				Sahni, Yuvraj; Cao, Jiannong; Zhang, Shigeng; Yang, Lei			Edge Mesh: A New Paradigm to Enable Distributed Intelligence in Internet of Things	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Edge devices; Internet of Things; distributed intelligence; distributed computing; mesh network	CENTRIC INTERNET; INTEGRATION; CHALLENGES; NETWORKS; SERVICES; SYSTEM	In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, lowlatency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh. Different application scenarios, including smart home, intelligent transportation system, and healthcare, are presented to illustrate the significance of Edge Mesh computing paradigm.

The number of sensing devices is rapidly increasing along with the amount of sensing data. Consequently, a bottleneck problem at the local gateway has attracted high concern. An example scenario is smart elderly houses in rural areas where each house installs thousands of sensors and all connect to resource-limited and unstable 2G/3G networks. The bottleneck state can incur unacceptable latency and loss of significant data due to the limited waiting-queue. Orthogonally to the existing solutions, we propose a two-tier prioritization system to enhance information quality, indicated by VoI, at the local gateway. The proposed system has been designed to support several requirements with several conflicting criteria over shared sensing streams. Our approach adopts Multicriteria Decision Analysis technique to merge requirements and to assess the VoI. We introduce the framework that can reduce the computational cost by precalculation. Through a case study of building management systems, we have shown that our merge algorithm can provide 0.995 cosine-similarity for representing all user requirements and the evaluation approach can obtain satisfaction values around 3 times higher than the naive strategies for the top-list data.

At present, the emissions of carbon dioxide have become the main greenhouse gas composition, and have received the attention of all parties. Port is an important stage in the process of logistics and transportation. The large amounts of carbon emissions have brought a huge burden to environmental improvement. In order to develop green economy, a thorough research on the port logistics carbon emission management system is necessary. Under the premise of pertinence, the existing function of each node can be improved. Through the study of the specific model in the concept of Internet of things, the basic structure, intelligent node, gateway node and the various parts of the operating system of the port logistics carbon emission management system were investigated based on the idea of green and low-carbon. Hopefully this can be helpful to the management and decision related to carbon emissions for those port logistics enterprises.

In addition, we drew up a new generation of Internet protocol implementation scheme in 6LoWPAN, which is the access of the combination of the mobile node and IoT gateway, etc. In the local IoT, things connect with IPv6, which satisfy the demand of mobility, the whole IoT architecture model of IPv6 connection will be implemented. The analysis and evaluation of network performance was completed in Cooja simulator based on Contiki system after the hardware test. Results show that this method is suitable for the stub network of Internet of things in the common dynamic scenes and more efficient and less packet loss probability when compare to the original 6LoWPAN.

J	Yao, XF; Wang, L				Yao, Xiaofeng; Wang, Lei			Design and implementation of IOT gateway based on embedded mu Tenux operating system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND UTILITY COMPUTING			English	Article						IOT gateway; OS; mu Tenux; mu T/studio		Among the three layers of the Internet of Things (IoT), perceptual layer and network layer belong to the heterogeneous network, which can't communicate directly; they need an IoT gateway to realise the communication protocol conversion between the two layers. Because the gateway does not have a unified standard in the field of IoT, the gateway of each manufacturer has certain limitations. In this paper, combining actual gateway requirements definition in the network, small intelligent gateway was accomplished based on an OSI model that integrated ZigBee and TCP/IP protocols. The gateway provides Wi-Fi control interface for the user, and supports OTA, risk management and behaviour analysis operation etc. The STM32F439NI development board of ST company was adopted as the test platform, and the test was completed through cooperating with the Wi-Fi module and the ZigBee module. The results indicate that the design has better stability and higher performance.

A Reconfigurable IoT Architecture with Energy Efficient Event-Based Data Traffic Reduction Scheme	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data Transfer Scheme; Internet of Things; Network Architecture; Wireless Network	INTERNET; THINGS; SYSTEMS; WEB	Designing an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled environment requires integration of various things/ devices. Integrating these devices require a generalized approach as these devices can have different communication protocols. In this paper, we have proposed generalized nodes for connecting various devices. These nodes are capable of creating a scalable local wireless network that connects to the cloud through a network gateway. The nodes also support over the air programming to re-configure the network from the cloud. As number of devices connected to the cloud increases, the network traffic also increases. In order to reduce the network traffic we have used different data transfer schemes for the network. We have also proposed an event-based data transfer scheme for situations where there is low probability of change in sensor value. The experimental results shows that the event-based scheme reduces the data traffic by up to 48% under practical conditions without any loss of information compared to priority based data transfer. We have also shown that the proposed scheme is more reliable for data transfer in a large network with a success rate of 99.5% measured over 200 minutes for 1201 data packets.

J	Srinivas, J; Mukhopadhyay, S; Mishra, D				Srinivas, Jangirala; Mukhopadhyay, Sourav; Mishra, Dheerendra			Secure and efficient user authentication scheme for multi-gateway wireless sensor networks	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); Wireless sensor networks(WSNs); Authentication	KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME; MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION; POWER ANALYSIS; SMART CARDS; PROTOCOL; INTERNET; ATTACKS	By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT), the collected information from the sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) could be provided to the users who are permitted to get access of sensor nodes. As the information from the sensors are transmitted via public network and sensor nodes have limited battery, shift the focus on security and efficiency in WSNs. User authentication is the security task for limiting the access. It is achieved by equipping authorized users with passwords, tokens or biometrics. However, password and token are easy being stolen and forgotten; even biometrics inherit some limitation. More suitable approach is to combine both password and biometric authenticator to harvest benefits in security. This paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs using biohashing. Biohashing facilitates elimination of false accept rates without increasing occurrence of false rejection rate. Additionally, biohashing has highly clear separation of imposter populations and genuine, and zero equal error rate level. The proposed scheme also supports dynamic node addition and user friendly password change mechanism. Using the BAN-logic, we prove that the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication. In addition, we simulate proposed scheme for the security against man-in-the middle attack and replay attack using the AVISPA tool, and the simulation results show that our scheme is safe. Through the informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against the known attacks for authentication protocols. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, with the increasing number of involved devices, IoT systems may consume substantial amounts of energy. Thus, the relevant energy efficiency issues have recently been attracting much attention from both aca-demia and industry. In this article we adopt an energy-efficient architecture for Industrial IoT (IIoT), which consists of a sense entities domain, RESTful service hosted networks, a cloud server, and user applications. Under this architecture, we focus on the sense entities domain where huge amounts of energy are consumed by a tremendous number of nodes. The proposed framework includes three layers: the sense layer, the gateway layer, and the control layer. This hierarchical framework balances the traffic load and enables a longer lifetime of the whole system. Based on this deployment, a sleep scheduling and wake-up protocol is designed, supporting the prediction of sleep intervals. The shifts of states support the use of the entire system resources in an energy-efficient way. Simulation results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed architecture in resource utilization and energy consumption.

Aggregation logic is typically programmed in the C language and embedded into the firmware. However, developing aggregation programs is difficult for M2M service providers because it requires gateway-specific knowledge and consideration of resource issues, especially RAM usage. In addition, modification of aggregation logic requires the application of firmware updates, which are risky. We propose a rule-based sensor data aggregation system, called the complex sensor data aggregator (CSDA), for M2M gateways. The functions comprising the data aggregation process are subdivided into the categories of filtering, statistical calculation, and concatenation. The proposed CSDA supports this aggregation process in three steps: the input, periodic data processing, and output steps. The behaviors of these steps are configured by an XML-based rule. The rule is stored in the data area of flash ROM and is updatable through the Internet without the need for a firmware update. In addition, in order to keep within the memory limit specified by the M2M gateway's manufacturer, the number of threads and the size of the working memory are static after startup, and the size of the working memory can be adjusted by configuring the sampling setting of a buffer for sensor data input. The proposed system is evaluated in an M2M gateway experimental environment. Results show that developing CSDA configurations is much easier than using C because the configuration decreases by 10%. In addition, the performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed system's ability to operate on M2M gateways.

In the proposed system, all necessary components, including the battery, energy-harvesting solar cells, and the RF antenna, are fully integrated within a millimeter-scale form factor. Designing an energy-optimized wireless communication system for such a miniaturized platform is challenging because of unique system constraints imposed by the ultra-small system dimension. The proposed system targets orders of magnitude improvement in wireless communication energy efficiency through a comprehensive system-level analysis that jointly optimizes various system parameters, such as node dimension, modulation scheme, synchronization protocol, RF/analog/digital circuit specifications, carrier frequency, and a miniaturized 3-D antenna. We propose a new protocol and modulation schemes that are specifically designed for energy-scarce ultrasmall IoT nodes. These new schemes exploit abundant signal processing resources on gateway devices to simplify design for energy-scarce ultra-small sensor nodes. The proposed dynamic link adaptation guarantees that the ultra-small IoT node always operates in the most energy efficient mode for a given operating scenario. The outcome is a truly energy-optimized wireless communication system to enable various classes of new applications, such as implanted smart-dust devices.

The DA-GW framework is designed to improve the throughput performance and energy efficiency of group communication to monitor and control multiple sensor devices collectively with a single user terminal. The DA-GW consists of four function blocks-the message analyzer, group manager, message scheduler and data handler-and three informative databases-the client database, resource database and information database. The DA-GW performs group management and group communication through each functional block and stores resources in the informative databases. The DA-GW employs international standard-based data structures and provides the interoperability of heterogeneous devices used in various applications. The DA-GW is implemented using a Java-based open source framework called jCoAP to evaluate the functions and performance of the DA-GW. The experiment results showed that the DA-GW framework revealed better performance than existing group communication methods in terms of throughput and energy consumption.

J	Yeh, KH				Yeh, Kuo-Hui			BSNCare plus : A Robust IoT-Oriented Healthcare System with Non-Repudiation Transactions	Applied Sciences-Basel			English	Article						authentication; healthcare; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy; security	NETWORK; CLOUD	Recently, the rapid advancement in technologies of modern intelligent objects has led to a new network paradigm, called the Internet of Things (IoT), in which every networked and automated object has been connected in a pervasive manner. New types of IoT-based application services are thus presented. In a healthcare oriented environment, the usage of IoT has brought opportunities for assisting physicians (or nurses) to provide on-demand and real-time body-care services to patients with higher accuracy and better efficiency. However, while IoT-oriented techniques deliver such advantages, they may encounter system security vulnerabilities and patient privacy threats not seen in the past. In this paper, we propose a robust IoT-based healthcare system, called BSNCare+, in which body sensor networks (BSNs) are adopted as the underlying communication architecture. In the proposed healthcare system, we exploit lightweight crypto-primitives to construct a secure communication mechanism that does achieve data confidentiality and entity authentication among intelligent body sensors, the mobile gateway and the backend BSN-Care server. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed healthcare system using the Raspberry PI series platform. The results show the practicability and feasibility of BSNCare+.

Vehicles as part of the Internet of Things should provide to the driver and passenger with a variety of services using efficient gateway discovery mechanism while maintaining a certain level of security and authentication to avoid potential malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure hybrid adaptive gateway discovery and communication protocol for smart vehicular networks, which we refer to as SEGAL. Our proposed SEGAL protocol is based upon building a secure clustered vehicular network, and permits the exchange of gateway discovery messages through authenticated clusterheads and cluster members. We shall present the design of our protocol, and describe how it can overcome the possible malicious attacks that might harm the network. Then, we report its efficiency and scalability using an extensive set of simulation experiments using Ns-2 simulator. Our results indicate that the proposed SEGAL protocol is scalable while achieving high success rate, low response time and dropping rate. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Altamimi, AB; Ramadan, RA				Altamimi, Ahmed B.; Ramadan, Rabie A.			Towards internet of things modeling: a gateway approach	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS MODELING			English	Article						Gateways deployment; Geographical based modeling; Ferries based modeling	ADAPTIVE COMMUNICATION-NETWORKS; SELF-ORGANIZATION; COMPLEX NETWORKS; AD HOC; WIRELESS; INTEGRATION; PLACEMENT; SYSTEMS	Purpose: Internet of things (IoT) is an interaction between more than one network to facilitate communication. These networks by themselves are complex networks. Therefore, IoT network is expected to grow at unprecedented scale involving other networks such as Mobile, VANET, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In fact, modeling each network by itself is a complicated process. In addition, on a large scale, the communication among these networks increases the modeling complexity in which energy consumption could be critical due to large number of dropped messages. Therefore, this paper is a step forward towards modeling IoT complex network through gateway deployment. The paper answers the question of how to deploy these gateways in a way that guarantees an efficient and adaptive communication. Methods: Two models/methods are proposed and examined which are geographical based and mobile ferry based models. Due to the complexity of the deployment problem in reality, the deployment problem is treated as a complex adaptive problem and simulated through different sets of experiments and settings. Results: The two methods have been compared through set of experiments using ONE simulator with the same number of employed gateways in the two methods. The experiments shows that ferry based model outperforms geographical based model with 29% improvement in messages delivery probability. Additionally, when the number of mobile ferries are reduced by 34% compared to gateways that are distributed based on geographical area, the mobile ferries approach still outperform geographical area based approach when it comes to messages delivery probability. Conclusions: The paper presents the two methods to model the complex internet of things environment and its sub networks interaction. The paper concludes that employing mobile ferries as gateways is better than deploying gateways based on geographical area when the sub networks interaction is facilitated in IoT network.

J	Kang, J; Park, G; Park, JH				Kang, Jungho; Park, Geunil; Park, Jong Hyuk			Design of secure authentication scheme between devices based on zero-knowledge proofs in home automation service environments	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						IoT; Smart home automation; Smart home network system; Sensor; Home gateway; Zero knowledge proof	SMART HOME; SENSOR; NETWORKS; ACCESS; ZIGBEE; SYSTEM	Due to the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, various services have been developed. Among different types of IoT technologies, one of the representative examples is smart home environment that has made it much convenient to live as IoT technology started being applied to humans. In addition, smart home environment has been utilized in many fields with related services due to rapid development of the smart home market. Smart home automation that has been rapidly growing in the smart home market communicates by providing the least requirement of the computing function along with the least amount of security compared to the network used in other fields. Therefore, a secure authentication phase is required among devices in the smart home automation network in the use of the least amount of computing function. This study is intended to design mutual authentication protocol that is secure and optimized among devices in the smart home automation network and suggest efficient authentication technique based on zero-knowledge proof instead of the use of secret value between sensor node and home gateway to solve an issue of security threat.

Task requirement aware pre-processing and Scheduling for IoT sensory environments	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet-of-Things; Wireless sensor networks; Task allocation; Quality of service	INTERNET; THINGS; SERVICES; NETWORKS	In Internet of Things (IoT) sensory environment Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are connected to the Internet through gateways and this gives birth to many real time sensor based applications. Applications from Internet querying for Spatio-temporal information within WSN may require query decomposition. Decomposition of queries may result in tasks having similar functional and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Thus pre-processing the tasks results in decreased number of task executions within WSN as compared to executing tasks individually. Moreover prior knowledge of sensor nodes' residual energy can help in deciding if a task can be scheduled for its successful completion. Existing energy monitoring protocols in WSNs incur considerable amount of message traffic and energy. Thus an Energy Monitoring System (EMS) that works on reduced message traffic and yet provide the correct energy information will be of great value. This paper proposes Task Requirements Aware Pre-processing and Scheduling (TRAPS) mechanism comprising a task pre-processor, EMS and scheduler within the gateway. The scheduler allocates the best available sensor nodes to the incoming tasks while meeting their QoS requirement. Task pre-processor and EMS are tested individually to measure the key performance metrics that include number of tasks entering WSN and energy information prediction accuracy respectively. Further the performance evaluation of TRAPS is extended to study its effects on various network parameters. It is found that TRAPS outperforms the findings of recent research on task scheduling in IoT sensory environments in terms of the identified network performance metrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A Standard-Based and Context-Aware Architecture for Personal Healthcare Smart Gateways	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						e-Health; Personal health devices; Personal area networks; IEEE 11073		The rising availability of Personal Health Devices (PHDs) capable of Personal Network Area (PAN) communication and the desire of keeping a high quality of life are the ingredients of the Connected Health vision. In parallel, a growing number of personal and portable devices, like smartphones and tablet computers, are becoming capable of taking the role of health gateway, that is, a data collector for the sensor PHDs. However, as the number of PHDs increase, the number of other peripherals connected in PAN also increases. Therefore, PHDs are now competing for medium access with other devices, decreasing the Quality of Service (QoS) of health applications in the PAN. In this article we present a reference architecture to prioritize PHD connections based on their state and requirements, creating a healthcare Smart Gateway. Healthcare context information is extracted by observing the traffic through the gateway. A standard-based approach was used to identify health traffic based on ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards. A reference implementation was developed showing the relevance of the problem and how the proposed architecture can assist in the prioritization. The reference Smart Gateway solution was integrated with a Connected Health System for the Internet of Things, validating its use in a real case scenario.	[Santos, Danilo F.

To comprehend this vision, this article studies the design of a large-scale IoT system for smart grid application, which constitutes a large number of home users and has the requirement of fast response time. In particular, we focus on the messaging protocol of a universal IoT home gateway, where our cloud enabled system consists of a back-end server, a unified home gateway (UHG) at the end users, and a user interface for mobile devices. We discuss the features of such an IoT system to support a large-scale deployment with a UHG and real-time residential smart grid applications. Based on the requirements, we design an IoT system using XMPP and implemented in a testbed for energy management applications. To show the effectiveness of the designed testbed, we present some results using the proposed IoT architecture.

Retransmission mechanisms are introduced to compensate for the lack of data reliability. If the device does not receive the acknowledgement (ACK) before retransmission timeout (RTO) expires, the device will retransmit data. Setting an appropriate RTO is important because the delay may be large or retransmission may be too frequent when the RTO is inappropriate. We propose a Gateway-assisted CoAP (GaCoAP) to dynamically compute RTO for devices. Simulation models are proposed to investigate the performance of GaCoAP compared with four other methods. The experiment results show that GaCoAP is more suitable for IoT devices.

The COSWOB monitors the CO concentration in ambient conditions around natural gas water heaters and transmits it to an intelligent gateway. When the CO level reaches a dangerous level, the COSWOB alarm sounds loudly. Meanwhile, the intelligent gateway also sends a trigger to activate Wi-Fi alarms and sends notifications to the mobile device through the Internet. Our strategy can warn people indoors and outdoors, thereby reducing CO poisoning accidents. We also believe that our technique not only can be used for home security but also can be used in industrial applications (for example, to monitor leak occurrence in a pipeline).

The Raspberry Pi platform has become a very interesting choice for IoT applications for several reasons: (1) good computing power/cost ratio; (2) high availability; it has become a de facto hardware standard; and (3) ease of use; it is based on operating systems with a big community of users. In IoT applications, data are frequently carried by means of wireless sensor networks in which energy consumption is a key issue. Energy consumption is especially relevant for smart sensors that are scattered over wide geographical areas and may need to work unattended on batteries for long intervals of time. In this scenario, it is convenient to ease the construction of IoT applications while keeping energy consumption to a minimum at the sensors. This work proposes a possible gateway implementation with specific technologies. It solves the following research question: how to build gateways for IoT applications with Raspberry Pi and low power IQRF communication modules. The following contributions are presented: (1) one architecture for IoT gateways that integrates data from sensor nodes into a higher level application based on low-cost/low-energy technologies; (2) bindings in Java and C that ease the construction of IoT applications; (3) an empirical model that describes the consumption of the communications at the nodes (smart sensors) and allows scaling their batteries; and (4) validation of the proposed energy model at the battery-operated nodes.

J	Lin, HC; Bergmann, N				Lin, Huichen; Bergmann, Neilw.			IoT Privacy and Security Challenges for Smart Home Environments	INFORMATION			English	Article						Internet of Things; cybersecurity; Smart Home	INTERNET; THINGS	Often the Internet of Things ( IoT) is considered as a single problem domain, with proposed solutions intended to be applied across a wide range of applications. However, the privacy and security needs of critical engineering infrastructure or sensitive commercial operations are very different to the needs of a domestic Smart Home environment. Additionally, the financial and human resources available to implement security and privacy vary greatly between application domains. In domestic environments, human issues may be as important as technical issues. After surveying existing solutions for enhancing IoT security, the paper identifies key future requirements for trusted Smart Home systems. A gateway architecture is selected as the most appropriate for resource-constrained devices, and for high system availability. Two key technologies to assist system auto-management are identified. Firstly, support for system auto-configuration will enhance system security. Secondly, the automatic update of system software and firmware is needed to maintain ongoing secure system operation.

Resources are named through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) at the application layer and typically reachable at the network layer through IP connectivity. Such an approach can be used also to access extremely resource-constrained devices, provided that lightweight interactions with a gateway, remotely exposing their resources, are granted. Among potential alternatives to support communication between the gateway and such constrained devices, we investigate the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, gaining momentum in the future Internet research arena. It differs from the host-centric IP networking in that it cares for the content to retrieve instead of the device hosting it By directly using content names at the network layer and a receiver-driven communication, ICN well fits the requirements of many machine-to-machine (M2M) applications that are information-centric in nature and rely on a publish-subscribe service model. In this paper, we propose an ICN-based solution to be deployed on top of constrained devices whose named resources are exposed at a wide area scope by an M2M gateway. The proposal aims at ensuring easy interoperability with ETSI M2M specifications, thus allowing remote applications to access the resources of ICN-enabled nodes.

Smart IoT Gateway For Heterogeneous Devices Interoperability	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Internet of Things; Gateway; Interoperability; Interconnection; MQTT		The Internet of things (IoT) will interconnect a huge amount of devices, leading to a new way of interaction in the physical and virtual world, inspired by the idea of ubiquity, where all the objects around us, such as: sensors, automobiles, refrigerators, thermostats, industrial robots, tablets, smartphones, etc. could be connected anytime and anywhere. However, one of the main challenges that faces IoT is the high degree of heterogeneity in terms of communication capabilities of the devices, protocols, technologies or hardware. We focus on the implementation of a new Smart IoT Gateway designed to allow interconnection and interoperability between heterogeneous devices in the IoT. The proposed gateway offers significant advantages: (i) it enables connectivity of different protocols and traditional communication technologies (Ethernet) and wireless (ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi); (ii) it uses a flexible protocol that translates all the data obtained from the different sensors into a uniform format, performing the analysis of the data obtained from the environment-based-rules related to the different types of sensors; (iii) it uses a lightweight and optimal protocol on the use of devices with limited resources for delivering information environment; and (iv) it provides local data storage for later use and analysis. Our proof of concept demonstrates the performance and capacity of the proposed Smart IoT Gateway is related with Active and Healthy Aging (AHA).	[Yacchirema, D.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple access protocol with time-slot reservation that can increase the success rate of the uplink data transmission with collision avoidance in the IoT. Further, using a modem calculator tool from the LoRa Alliance, we evaluate the system performance of the low power wide area network which is designed for sensors and applications in terms of equivalent bitrate, time on air, and Tx energy consumption for the uplink of the IoTDs.

J	Kim, YG; Wang, Y; Park, B; Choi, HH				Kim, Yang G.; Wang, Yu; Park, ByoungSeob; Choi, Hyo Hyun			A heuristic resource scheduling scheme in time-constrained networks	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multi-channel; Multi-timeslot; Multi-hop; Scheduling algorithms; End-to-end delay; Wireless sensor networks	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; VERSION	Sensor device is emerging as a promising enabler for the development of new solutions in a plethora of Internet of Things (loT) applications. With the explosion of connected devices, it is essential for conversion gateway between the Internet and sensor nodes to support end-to-end (e2e) interoperability because the current Internet Protocol (IT) does not support end-to-end delay in IEEE 802.15.4e. As part of IoT, we propose a scheduling scheme of multiple channels and multiple timeslots to minimize the e2e delay in multi-hop environments. The proposed greedy heuristic approach is compared with the meta-heuristics in terms of the given end-to-end delay bound. Although the meta-heuristics is more accurate in finding a global optimum or sub-optimal values than the greedy heuristic approach, this advantage comes at the expense of high complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the complexity by obtaining suboptimal solutions that satisfy the e2e delay requirement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Safeguarding personal information privacy is an increasing concern in smart living services. To guarantee the mobile security of smart living services, security managers use taint checking approaches with dynamic taint propagation analysis operations to examine how a software-defined networking app uses sensitive information and investigate suspicious security vulnerabilities of devices and the effects of the spread of taint propagation over the Internet by identifying taint paths. For solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem, most approaches focus on cloud computing applications (apps) with malware threat analysis that involves program vulnerability analyses, rather than on the risk posed by suspicious apps connected to the cloud computing server. Accordingly, this article proposes a taint propagation analysis model incorporating a weighted spanning tree analysis scheme for tracking data with taint marking using several taint checking tools with an open software-defined networking architecture for solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem. In the proposed model, Android programs perform dynamic taint propagation to analyse the spread of risks posed by suspicious apps connected to the centralised gateway in a smart home system. In probabilistic risk analysis, risk and defence capability are used for each taint path to assist a defender in recognising the attack results against network threats caused by malware infection and to estimate the losses of associated taint sources. A case of threat analysis of a typical cyber security attack is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. A new approach was used for verifying the details of an attack sequence for malware infection by incorporating a finite state machine to appropriately represent the real dynamic taint propagation analysis situations at various configuration settings and safeguard deployment. The experimental results proved that the threat analysis model enables a defender to convert the spread of taint propagation to loss and estimate the risk of a specific threat using behavioural analysis associated with 60 families of real malware. Consequently, our scheme was significantly effective in predicting the risk and loss of tainted data propagation for security concerns in smart home systems when the number of taint paths associated with the propagation rules discovered through taint analysis was increased.

Today, several approaches exist to facilitate communication of sensors and actuators in IoT applications. Most communications go through often proprietary gateways requiring availability of the gateway for each and every interaction between sensors and actuators. Sometimes, the gateway does some processing of the sensor data before triggering actuators. Other approaches put this processing logic further in the cloud. These approaches introduce significant latencies and increased number of packets. In this paper, we introduce a CoAP-based mechanism for direct binding of sensors and actuators. This flexible binding solution is utilized further to build IoT applications through RESTlets. RESTlets are defined to accept inputs and produce outputs after performing some processing tasks. Sensors and actuators could be associated with RESTlets (which can be hosted on any device) through the flexible binding mechanism we introduced. This approach facilitates decentralized IoT application development by placing all or part of the processing logic in Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). We run several tests to compare the performance of our solution with existing solutions and found out that our solution reduces communication delay and number of packets in the LLN.

For most sensor nodes, the macro cells of cellular networks provide cost-effective connectivity. However, covering the remaining nodes, which are either in the out-of-service state or have short-range wireless interfaces only, is a difficult issue. For example, when deploying small cells densely to provide fuller node coverage, the cost of the small cells should be well considered. From the perspective of economy, small cells that use the passive optical network (PON) and moderately priced wireless interfaces, called fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) in this paper, seem the most promising candidates. However, the flexibility in Fi-Wi system deployment is strictly constrained by the need for a stable power source. Because most of the PON systems have been developed for fiber to the home (FTTH), the gateway node on the customer premise continuously consumes power and thus requires a stable power source. Therefore, the key issue is how to reduce the power consumption of the Fi-Wi gateway node drastically enough to run continuously with only battery and/or solar power. Additionally, the power-saving approach must meet the requirements of the IoT applications at the same time. We focus on the deep sleep approach, which turns OFF almost all the components, with significant power savings at the cost of a drop in quality of service (QoS). This paper proposes methods to control the deep sleep while assuring successful packet reception.

IPAs are software agents used to support users to fulfill several daily actions. They are supposed to be intelligent in such a way that allows them to give their owners advices about many different subjects. To do so, IPAs must learn about their user behavior and routines. With the current state of the art technologies, scenarios of ubiquitous communication can be created. One of the potential enablers for those scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. In an IoT environment, IPAs can interact with other smart objects in order to gain new knowledge and awareness about their users. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, that will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately. The algorithms used for each mobile gateway service, and the scenarios where the mobile gateway acts as a communication channel or a smart object are also addressed on this paper.

J	Liu, J				Liu, Jun			Design and Implementation of an Intelligent Environmental-Control System: Perception, Network, and Application with Fused Data Collected from Multiple Sensors in a Greenhouse at Jiangsu, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							INTERNET; THINGS; ARCHITECTURE	Big-data (BD) can contribute to the perceptive layer in the Internet of Things (IoT). BD for environmental factors at the tiny scale has to be obtained by simultaneously monitoring and fusing data collected from multiple sensors. In this study, we designed an intelligent environmental-monitor-control system for the precise culture of grape (Vitis vinifera "Wink") in greenhouse IoT. Sensors were equipped to obtain multiple types of data, which were then fused at the gateway and stored, analyzed, and modified in the background. Environmental factors included air temperature, air humidity, illumination, soil moisture, and CO2 concentration. Also, videos and images were recorded during the grape growth. The whole system was identified on an online platform with a static IP and a domain name. The fore-and backgrounds were communicated to each other by a real-time connection, and a database was activated whilst the website was open at the foreground. Results indicated that fused data can be successfully stored, transmitted, and treated for dotted graph creation and background management on a self-built online platform. Our study illustrated the availability of data fusion for BD and supplied a feasible instance for the implementation of this technique in IoT for the greenhouse environment.

Because of the vast difference in bit rates between both networks, buffering characteristics of these gateways are becoming important. In this paper, we modeled a fieldbus gateway using an M/M/1 queuing system for the transient packet buffering. Assuming burst packet arrivals at the gateway, time trends of the expected value and the standard deviation of the number of buffered packets were calculated analytically. Validity of our analysis was confirmed using computer simulation for CSMA/CD communications. Time trend curves for the expected value and the standard deviation matched within 5% and 20 %, respectively. Our transient analysis method provides a practical estimation method for the transient performance of the fieldbus gateways. (C) 2016 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

J	Serdaroglu, KC; Baydere, S				Serdaroglu, Kemal Cagri; Baydere, Sebnem			WiSEGATE: Wireless Sensor Network Gateway framework for internet of things	WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						IoT; WSN; TCP; Gateway		With internet of things vision, computing systems get the ubiquity of real world. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology plays a critical role for the construction of this paradigm. Hence, WSN technology should be adapted to support interoperability with the commodity internet entities. Since technological background of WSN and IP networks do not fit each other, this effort is not a straightforward process. In this paper, we introduce WiSEGATE which addresses end-to-end reliable interconnection problem between multiple internet entities and sensor nodes. WiSEGATE is a prototype of a new web server which supports three tier service scheme with a data acquisition mechanism of WSN to access the physical data in particular locations in the real world. In WiSEGATE, an interconnection gateway handles operations required for the interoperability. Since this gateway maintains reliable TCP/IP connections of the interconnected entities, the resource constraint sensor nodes on WSN do not require a TCP/IP stack for handling end-to-end connections. A lightweight service layer is implemented on a sensor node for operations required by the interconnection. The strength and novelty of the model lies in the fact that this lightweight service layer relieves extra memory usage for end-to-end connection management. For determining limits of the proposed model, firstly, we examined the steps for request/response mechanism and modeled the gateway as a queueing system. By doing this, we derive a definition of the request traffic. For proof of concept, we performed comprehensive tests in simulation and real testbed environments for WLAN connection. WiSEGATE can achieve reasonable response times up to 80 simultaneous connections from remote entities to WSN when WLAN PER is less than 0.2.

However, we found some problems with Farash et al.'s protocol, such as a known session-specific temporary information attack, an off-line password-guessing attack using a stolen-smartcard, a new-smartcard-issue attack, and a user-impersonation attack. Additionally, their protocol cannot preserve user anonymity, and the secret key of the gateway node is insecure. The main intention of this paper is to design an efficient and robust smartcard-based user authentication and session key agreement protocol for wireless sensor networks that use the Internet of Things. We analyze its security, proving that our protocol not only overcomes the weaknesses of Farash et al.'s protocol, but also preserves additional security attributes, such as the identity change and smartcard revocation phases. Moreover, the results of a simulation using AVISPA show that our protocol is secure against active and passive attacks. The security and performance of our work are also compared with a number of related protocols. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Amin, Ruhul; Biswas, G.

Extraction and analysis of non-volatile memory of the ZW0301 module, a Z-Wave transceiver	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Z-Wave; Wireless; Embedded systems; Internet of Things forensic analysis; IoT forensics	FORENSICS	Z-Wave is an implementation of home automation, under the broad category of Internet of Things (IoT). To date, the ability to perform forensic investigations on Z-Wave devices has largely been ignored; however, the placement of these devices in homes and industrial facilities makes them valuable assets for the investigation of criminal and adversarial actors. Z-Wave devices consist of sensors and actuators, which can be connected to the Internet via a gateway. Therefore, their memory contents may contain sensor reports of criminal activity or, more indirectly, provide evidence that the devices have been manipulated to achieve physical or cyber access. This paper provides details on extracting and programming the Flash and EEPROM memory of the ZW0301, which is a common Z-Wave transceiver module found on many Z-Wave devices. Specifically, the memory usage is characterized and several artifacts are identified. The feasibility of conducting a firmware modification attack on the ZW0301 is also explored. The results of this work identify several data structures including the node protocol information table and node adjacency table. The compiler and coding language used for the firmware image are also fingerprinted. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The drive to reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the increasing installation of meters and sensors for monitoring energy use and indoor environmental conditions in buildings. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in building energy metering and environmental monitoring, including their social, economic, environmental and legislative drivers. The integration of meters and sensors with existing building energy management systems (BEMS) is critically appraised, especially with regard to communication technologies and protocols such as ModBus, M-Bus, Ethernet, Cellular, ZigBee, WiFi and BACnet. Findings suggest that energy metering is covered in existing policies and regulations in only a handful of countries. Most of the legislations and policies on energy metering in Europe are in response to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), 2002/91/EC. However, recent developments in policy are pointing towards more stringent metering requirements in future, moving away from voluntary to mandatory compliance. With regards to metering equipment, significant developments have been made in the recent past on miniaturisation, accuracy, robustness, data storage, ability to connect using multiple communication protocols, and the integration with BEMS and the Cloud - resulting in a range of available solutions, selection of which can be challenging. Developments in communication technologies, in particular in low-power wireless such as ZigBee and Bluetooth LE (BLE), are enabling cost-effective machine to machine (M2M) and internet of things (IoT) implementation of sensor networks. Privacy and data protection, however, remain a concern for data aggregators and end-users. The standardization of network protocols and device functionalities remains an active area of research and development, especially due to the prevalence of many protocols in the BEMS industry. Available solutions often lack interoperability between hardware and software systems, resulting in vendor lock-in. The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of available technologies for energy metering and environmental monitoring; their drivers, advantages and limitations; factors affecting their selection and future directions of research and development - for use a reference, as well as for generating further interest in this expanding research area.

J	Condry, MW; Nelson, CB				Condry, Michael W.; Nelson, Catherine Blackadar			Using Smart Edge IoT Devices for Safer, Rapid Response With Industry IoT Control Operations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Biometrics; client devices; control systems; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things (IoT); microcomputers; networks; security		The Internet of Things (IoT) offers the user seamless interoperability and connectivity between devices, systems, services, disparate networks, and in particular control systems. End users expect to connect quickly and transparently via any endpoint device, be it a phone, tablet, wearable, TV, car, or other system that is Internet enabled. Smart IoT devices can serve as versatile control system interfaces, allowing for rapid response and potentially ubiquitous access. However, these devices can present significant security challenges. Using these technologies for user access control at IoT endpoints is vulnerable to replay, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. This paper presents a model that combines the capabilities of smart IoT devices with control system gateways using real-time challenge response for secure control operations. The proposed solution using both endpoint and gateway devices employs a mix of compute, cryptography, signal/image processing, and communication capabilities for authentication and authorization functions. We propose a model that is more secure, scalable, and resilient with real-time performance as compared to traditional approaches. We also provide an example IoT architecture, by showing an overview of Intel's IoT framework for control system gateways currently deployed in control, manufacturing, transportation, and retail tracking environments.

J	Vogler, M; Schleicher, JM; Inzinger, C; Dustdar, S				Voegler, Michael; Schleicher, Johannes M.; Inzinger, Christian; Dustdar, Schahram			A Scalable Framework for Provisioning Large-Scale IoT Deployments	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						IoT; framework; provisioning; large-scale; resource-constrained; gateway	INTERNET; THINGS; DELIVERY	Internet of Things (iIoT) devices are usually considered external application dependencies that only provide data or process and execute simple instructions. The recent emergence of IoT devices with embedded execution environments allows practitioners to deploy and execute custom application logic directly on the device. This approach fundamentally changes the overall process of designing, developing, deploying, and managing IoT systems. However, these devices exhibit significant differences in available execution environments, processing, and storage capabilities. To accommodate this diversity, a structured approach is needed to uniformly and transparently deploy application components onto a large number of heterogeneous devices. This is especially important in the context of large-scale IoT systems, such as in the smart city domain. In this article, we present LEONORE, an infrastructure toolset that provides elastic provisioning of application components on resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge devices in large-scale IoT deployments. LEONORE supports push-based as well as pull-based deployments. To improve scalability and reduce generated network traffic between cloud and edge infrastructure, we present a distributed provisioning approach that deploys LEONORE local nodes within the deployment infrastructure close to the actual edge devices. We show that our solution is able to elastically provision large numbers of devices using a testbed based on a real-world industry scenario.

Then, a representational state transfer(REST) framework for IoT based on software defined network (SDN) is proposed. Based on the proposed framework, control plane model and data plane model for IoT are proposed. In addition, a gateway model is provided to evaluate the proposed framework and use case results show that the proposed architectures are good for raw sensor data collecting.

J	Kwon, JH; Kim, EJ				Kwon, Jung-Hyok; Kim, Eui-Jik			Asymmetric Directional Multicast for Capillary Machine-to-Machine Using mmWave Communications	SENSORS			English	Article						asymmetric sectorization; capillary machine-to-machine; directional multicast; Internet of things; millimeter Wave communications	AD-HOC NETWORKS; ANTENNAS; SCHEME; TRANSMISSION; CHALLENGES; LIFETIME; INTERNET; THINGS; WPANS	The huge demand for high data rate machine-to-machine (M2M) services has led to the use of millimeter Wave (mmWave) band communications with support for a multi-Gbps data rate through the use of directional antennas. However, unnecessary sector switching in multicast transmissions with directional antennas results in a long delay, and consequently a low throughput. We propose asymmetric directional multicast (ADM) for capillary M2M to address this problem in mmWave communications. ADM provides asymmetric sectorization that is optimized for the irregular deployment pattern of mulicast group members. In ADM, an M2M gateway builds up asymmetric sectors with a beamwidth of a different size to cover all multicast group members with the minimum number of directional transmissions. The performance of ADM under various simulation environments is evaluated through a comparison with legacy mmWave multicast. The results of the simulation indicate that ADM achieves a better performance in terms of the transmission sectors, the transmission time, and the aggregate throughput when compared with the legacy multicast method.

J	King, J; Awad, AI				King, James; Awad, Ali Ismail			A Distributed Security Mechanism for Resource-Constrained IoT Devices	INFORMATICA-JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						internet of things (IoT); IoT security; class-0 IoT devices; object data encryption	INTERNET; THINGS; ENCRYPTION	Internet of Things (IoT) devices have developed to comprise embedded systems and sensors with the ability to connect, collect, and transmit data over the Internet. Although solutions to secure IoT systems exist, Class-0 IoT devices with insufficient resources to support such solutions are considered a resource-constrained in terms of secure communication. This paper provides a distributed security mechanism that targets Class-0 IoT devices. The research goal is to secure the entire data path in two segments, device-to-gateway and gateway-to-server data communications. The main concern in the provided solution is that lighter security operations with minimal resource requirements are performed in the IoT device, while heavier tasks are performed in the gateway side. The proposed mechanism utilizes a symmetric encryption for data objects combined with the native wireless security to offer a layered security technique between the device and the gateway. In the offered solution, the IoT gateways provide additional protection by securing data using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Real-time experimental evaluations have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed mechanism pertaining to the security assurance and the consumed resources of the target Class-0 IoT devices.

Considering the characteristics of M2M networks in IoTs systems, traditional security solutions are not able to be applied to E2E (End-to-End) M2M networks because the M2M network itself is vulnerable to various attacks. We consider security aspects for M2M communications and then propose a security gateway application (SGA) including the lightweight symmetric key cryptographic negotiation function, secure E2E M2M key exchange generation function and secure E2E M2M messages delivery function. The proposal of the SGA is newly suggested to improve the gateway application (GA) of the ITU-T M2M service layer in the IoTs reference model. We prove that it could prevent various attacks via the theoretical security analyses. Therefore, it could meet the basic security requirements of the M2M service layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Data in the data center can be remotely accessed by the user at any time and anywhere from end user devices such as PCs, laptop PCs, and smart phones., and data should be accessed securely. The Only legitimated user can access the data sensor from an environmental health data center. CP-ABE (Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption) is becoming a robust cryptographic scheme solution to this issue. To enable a secure data sensor sharing and access on an environmental health data center, we propose a secure system model using CP-ABE which ensures confidentiality, integrity, and user privacy features. Experimental results prove that the implementation of CP-ABE does not overload the system.	[Huda, Samsul; Fahmi, Nurul; Sudarsono, Amang; Al Rasyid, M.

Wireless technologies are important assets in the diffusion of this concept, as they allow the easy and seamless connection of all devices. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being established for sensing and actuating critical applications, like industrial automation, domotics and remote patient monitoring. The 6LoWPAN protocol has been proposed as the key to integrate WSNs and internet procotols. It is based in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is widely used in low power wireless networks. This paper evaluates the mechanisms of header compression and fragmentation of IPv6 datagrams proposed in the 6LoWPAN standard through experiments using a gateway prototype and IEEE 802.15.4 nodes.

J	Tseng, CH				Tseng, Chinyang Henry			Multipath Load Balancing Routing for Internet of Things	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article								In the next-generation technology, Internet of Things (IoT), billions of smart objects will communicate with one another to make human lives more convenient. IoT is based on wireless sensor network (WSN), and Zigbee is one of the most popular WSN protocols. A mature IoT environment involves heavy WSN data transmission causing bottleneck problems. However, Zigbee's AODV routing stack does not have load balance mechanism to handle bursty traffic. Therefore, we develop Multipath Load Balancing (MLB) Routing to substitute Zigbee's AODV routing. Our proposed MLB consists of two main designs: LAYER DESIGN and LOAD BALANCE. LAYER DESIGN assigns nodes into different layers based on node distance to IoT gateway. Nodes can have multiple next-hops delivering IoT data. All neighboring layer nodes exchange flow information containing current load, used by LOAD BALANCE to estimate future load of next-hops. With MLB, nodes can choose the neighbors with the least load as the next-hops and thus can achieve load balance and avoid bottlenecks. Compared with Zigbee's AODV and multipath version AODV (AOMDV), experiment results demonstrate that MLB achieves better load balance, lower packet loss rate, and better routing connectivity ratio in both grid and random uniform topologies. MLB provides a more convincing routing solution for IoT applications.

The integration between advanced technologies of ICT and tourism industry plays vital role in enhancing the tourism services and experiences, particularly, in the context of archaeological tourism. Following this, this study proposes a protocol that offers tourists site/destination and experiences according to their preferences. More specifically, tourists can express various preferences regarding the type of tourism site, their contention level in order to avoid crowded ones, the accessibility and convenience of different sections of a site, and the distance and congestion of the paths lead to such site. etc. Our Contention, Convenience and Accessibility based Smart Tourism-destination Approach (CASTA) is presented in this paper to offer online services for tourists assuming that they are always connected and they do not have advanced IT skills. A tourist has only to send a preference message that specifies all the personal constraints via a smart hand held device. A control unit that resides on the cloud analyzes the message and suggests a tour to certain sites and their sections based on the tourist preferences. Information about tourism sites and their sections, in terms of contention, convenience, and accessibility, is collected by wireless sensor networks and sent to the control unit via a gateway node. Results of simulated experiments of CASTA have shown that it outperforms the shortest path approach which suggests a tour based solely on the distance toward those tourism destinations. Moreover CASTA outperformance shortest path approach that takes the quality of network connections available over the selected paths.

J	Bai, ZY; Kuo, CH; Wang, TC				Bai, Zhi-yong; Kuo, Chin-Hwa; Wang, Tzu-Chia			Design and implementation of an IoT multi-interface gateway for establishing a digital art interactive system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AD HOC AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						digital arts; gateways; heterogeneous networks; identification; interactive systems; IoT; internet of things; smart objects; ubiquitous computing	SMART; INTEGRATION	The internet of things (IoTs) can be established by connecting smart objects in a wireless manner. However, a variety of wireless technologies, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, WiFi and infrared, which have been embedded into smart objects or controllers, cannot exchange information since they apply different standards or even work on different frequencies. To provide information exchange in heterogeneous networks, this paper proposes the design and implementation of an IoT multi-interface gateway, which can transform the information into a data which can be recognised by various smart objects. In the implementation, the IoT multi-interface gateway can be used for digital arts or some smart spaces that can automatically control traditional TV, air condition, smart meter, sphygmomanometer, smart phone, etc. The implementation shows that the IoT gateway can exchange data among various smart objects that use different wireless technologies and also guarantee the stability of data conversion time.

IoT goes beyond a broad range of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication technologies and covers a wide variety of networking protocols. There exist solutions like MQTT or SIP collecting data from sensors, CoAP for constrained devices and networks, or XMPP for interconnecting devices and people. Also there is a plethora of standards and frameworks (OSGi, AllJoyn) bringing closer the paradigm of IoT vision. However, the main constraint of most existing platforms is their limited mutual interoperability. To this end, we provide a comprehensive description of protocols suitable to support the IoT vision. Further, we advocate an alternative approach to already known principles and employ the SIP protocol as a container for M2M data. We provide description of data structures and practical implementation principles of the proposed structures (JSON and Protocol Buffers are discussed in detail) transmitted by SIP as a promising enabler for efficient M2M communication in the IoT world. Our reported findings are based on extensive hands-on experience collected after the development of advanced M2M smart home gateway in cooperation with the operator Telekom Austria Group.

J	Ding, F; Song, AG; Tong, E; Li, JQ				Ding, Fei; Song, Aiguo; Tong, En; Li, Jianqing			A Smart Gateway Architecture for Improving Efficiency of Home Network Applications	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							TECHNOLOGIES; PLATFORM; MHEALTH; SYSTEMS	A smart home gateway plays an important role in the Internet of Things (IoT) system that takes responsibility for the connection between the network layer and the ubiquitous sensor network (USN) layer. Even though the home network application is developing rapidly, researches on the home gateway based open development architecture are less. This makes it difficult to extend the home network to support new applications, share service, and interoperate with other home network systems. An integrated access gateway (IAGW) is proposed in this paper which upward connects with the operator machine-to-machine platform (M2M P/F). In this home network scheme, the gateway provides standard interfaces for supporting various applications in home environments, ranging from on-site configuration to node and service access. In addition, communication management ability is also provided by M2M P/F. A testbed of a simple home network application system that includes the IAGW prototype is created to test its user interaction capabilities. Experimental results show that the proposed gateway provides significant flexibility for users to configure and deploy a home automation network; it can be applied to other monitoring areas and simultaneously supports a multi-ubiquitous sensor network.

J	Hu, SS; Tang, CC; Liu, F; Wang, XJ				Hu, Shushan; Tang, Cunchen; Liu, Feng; Wang, Xiaojun			A distributed and efficient system architecture for smart home	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						IoT; internet of things; smart home; distributed system; SOA; service-oriented architecture; OSGi; open services gateway initiative	SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE; TARGET TRACKING; SENSOR NETWORKS; RESEARCH ISSUES; MOBILE-AGENT; OSGI; TECHNOLOGIES; TELEMEDICINE; MANAGEMENT; FUTURE	To improve the efficiency of deploying and calling of home services, this paper proposes a distributed service-oriented architecture (D-SOA) for a smart-home system. In this proposed D-SOA, a distributed bundle is designed for remote deploying of bundles and remote calling of services with open services gateway initiative (OSGi) architecture. Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is adopted to improve communication efficiency between terminals of a smart-home system. A specific interaction mechanism is designed to transmit data, using the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and the extensible markup language (XML). Performance analysis shows that the proposed D-SOA achieves up to 37.5% reduction in network load, and 65% improvement in response time, compared to service central system architectures.

J	Farash, MS; Turkanovic, M; Kumari, S; Holbi, M				Farash, Mohammad Sabzinejad; Turkanovic, Muhamed; Kumari, Saru; Hoelbi, Marko			An efficient user authentication and key agreement scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor network tailored for the Internet of Things environment	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet of Things; Wireless sensor networks; Key agreement; Authentication; BAN-logic; AVISPA tools	MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION; SECURITY; PROTOCOL; ATTACKS	The concept of Internet of Things (IOT), which is already at our front doors, is that every object in the Internet infrastructure (II) is interconnected into a global dynamic expanding network. Sensors and smart objects are beside classical computing devices key parties of the IOT. We can already exploit the benefits of the IOT by using various weareables or smart phones which are full of diverse sensors and actuators and are connected to the II via GPRS or Wi-Fi. Since sensors are a key part of IOT, thus are wireless sensor networks (WSN). Researchers are already working on new techniques and efficient approaches on how to integrate WSN better into the IOT environment. One aspect of it is the security aspect of the integration. Recently, Turkanovic et al.'s proposed a highly efficient and novel user authentication and key agreement scheme (UAKAS) for heterogeneous WSN (HWSN) which was adapted to the JOT notion. Their scheme presented a novel approach where a user from the JOT can authenticate with a specific sensor node from the HWSN without having to communicate with a gateway node. Moreover their scheme is highly efficient since it is based on a simple symmetric cryptosystem. Unfortunately we have found that Turkanovic et al.'s scheme has some security shortcomings and is susceptible to some cryptographic attacks. This paper focuses on overcoming the security weaknesses of Turkanovic et al.'s scheme, by proposing a new and improved UAKAS. The proposed scheme enables the same functionality but improves the security level and enables the HWSN to dynamically grow without influencing any party involved in the UAKAS. The results of security analysis by BAN-logic and AVISPA tools confirm the security properties of the proposed scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shih, CS; Wu, GF				Shih, Chi-Sheng; Wu, Guan-Fan			Multiple Protocol Transport Network Gateway for IoT Systems	APPLIED COMPUTING REVIEW			English	Article						ACM proceedings		Exchange data among devices in machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems is an essential feature for these systems. For the sake of simplicity and reliability, many M2M and IoT solutions support homogeneous/single network deployment. However, when the complexity of the system and the number of device vendors continue to grow, it is challenging, if not impossible, to build M2M and IoT systems with devices using single communication protocol. The targeted problem of this paper is to enable the communication among devices in heterogeneous networks. Multiple Protocol Transport Network (MPTN) gateway is designed to be a distributed messaging gateway to enable messaging among multiple networks. To leverage the routing capability in existing network protocols, MPTN gateway converts an end-to-end message request to a multiple segment message based on network topology. The protocol schedules periodic routing table update to pro-actively keep the routing table up to dates with long time intervals, and allows on-demand route update to shorten the delay on topology and connectivity change. The performance evaluation results show that the protocol completes table update within tens of milliseconds when there are more than ten devices in a system.

The security consideration should satisfy a concise set of cryptographic and security mechanisms, single security policy framework, and configuration parameters policy-dependent. This may require consideration of system perspectives, taking into account the entire system and device lifecycle, ease-of-use and ease-of-deployment.

J	Chen, WE; Chen, BE				Chen, Whai-En; Chen, Bo-En			An Effective NAT Traversal Mechanism for SIP/IMS Services in SDN-Enabled All-IP Mobile Networks	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						NAT; SDN; SIP/IMS and ALG		Network Address Translation (NAT) is the major solution to ease the IP address shortage problem and support the upcoming demands of huge IP address from the Machine-to-Machine communications and Internet of Things . However, NAT breaks the peer-to-peer communications and blocks the Internet-oriented requests. In order to resolve the problems, lots of NAT traversal solutions such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT, Universal Plug-and-Play, Traversal Using Relay NAT, Application-Layer Gateway (ALG) and Interactive Connectivity Establishment have been proposed. Among the NAT traversal solutions, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project adopts the ALG solution for SIP/IMS multimedia services in the mobile networks. The ALG solution does not require modifications to the clients (e.g., User Equipments). However, the ALG solution utilizes the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) proxy to translate the RTP packets, and thus this solution produces extra delay and packet loss possibility to the RTP packets. In this paper, we integrate Software-defined networking (SDN) to the All-IP mobile networks and propose a solution to improve the ALG solution in the SDN-enabled All-IP mobile networks. We derive the analytic models for analyzing the ALG solution and the proposed solution, and compare these two solutions in terms of the throughput, loss rate and delay.

Combining all these technologies requires a research effort to address all the challenges of these technologies, especially for sensing and delivering information from the physical world to cloud-hosted services. In this article we outline the most important issues related to standardization efforts, mobility of objects, networking and gateway access, and QoS support. In particular, we describe a novel IoT network architecture that integrates software defined networking (SDN) and data distribution service (DDS) middleware. The proposed architecture will improve service delivery of IoT systems and will bring flexibility to the network.

Each protocol focuses on a specific aspect of IoT communications. The lack of a protocol that can handle the vertical market requirements of IoT applications including machine-to-machine, machine-to-server, and server-to-server communications has resulted in a fragmented market between many protocols. In turn, this fragmentation is a main hindrance in the development of new services that require the integration of multiple IoT services to unlock new capabilities and provide horizontal integration among services. In this work, after articulating the major shortcomings of the current IoT protocols, we outline a rule-based intelligent gateway that bridges the gap between existing IoT protocols to enable the efficient integration of horizontal IoT services. While this intelligent gateway enhances the gloomy picture of protocol fragmentation in the context of IoT, it does not address the root cause of this fragmentation, which lies in the inability of the current protocols to offer a wide range of QoS guarantees. To offer a solution that stems the root cause of this protocol fragmentation issue, we propose a generic IoT protocol that is flexible enough to address the IoT vertical market requirements. In this regard, we enhance the baseline MQTT protocol by allowing it to support rich QoS features by exploiting a mix of IP multicasting, intelligent broker queuing management, and traffic analytics techniques. Our initial evaluation of the lightweight enhanced MQTT protocol reveals significant improvement over the baseline protocol in terms of the delay performance.

We propose a resource-constrained asymmetric redundancy elimination algorithm (RCARE) to leverage downlink bandwidth and receiver capability to accelerate the uplink data transfer. RCARE can be deployed on a client or a proxy. Different from existing asymmetric algorithms, RCARE uses a flexible matching mechanism to identify redundant data and allocates a small sender cache to absorb the high downlink traffic overhead. Compared to existing redundancy elimination algorithms, RCARE provides a scalable sender cache that is adaptive based on resource and performance. We evaluate RCARE with real traffic traces collected from multiple servers and a campus gateway. The trace-driven simulation results indicate that RCARE achieves higher goodput gains and reduces downlink traffic compared to existing asymmetric communication algorithms. We design an adaptation algorithm for resource-constrained senders sending multiple data streams. Our algorithm takes samples from data streams and predicts how to invest cache size on individual data streams to achieve maximal uplink goodput gain. The adaptation algorithm improves the goodput gain by up to 87% compared to the baseline. In first 10% of data streams (sorted by the optimal goodput gains), RCARE achieves up to 42% goodput gain on average.

J	Bagula, A; Castelli, L; Zennaro, M				Bagula, Antoine; Castelli, Lorenzo; Zennaro, Marco			On the Design of Smart Parking Networks in the Smart Cities: An Optimal Sensor Placement Model	SENSORS			English	Article						Internet-of-Things; wireless sensor networks; smart parking; radio frequency identification; optimal sensor placement	MULTIOBJECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM; IMPLEMENTATION; DEPLOYMENT; SCHEME	Smart parking is a typical IoT application that can benefit from advances in sensor, actuator and RFID technologies to provide many services to its users and parking owners of a smart city. This paper considers a smart parking infrastructure where sensors are laid down on the parking spots to detect car presence and RFID readers are embedded into parking gates to identify cars and help in the billing of the smart parking. Both types of devices are endowed with wired and wireless communication capabilities for reporting to a gateway where the situation recognition is performed. The sensor devices are tasked to play one of the three roles: (1) slave sensor nodes located on the parking spot to detect car presence/absence; (2) master nodes located at one of the edges of a parking lot to detect presence and collect the sensor readings from the slave nodes; and (3) repeater sensor nodes, also called anchor nodes, located strategically at specific locations in the parking lot to increase the coverage and connectivity of the wireless sensor network. While slave and master nodes are placed based on geographic constraints, the optimal placement of the relay/anchor sensor nodes in smart parking is an important parameter upon which the cost and efficiency of the parking system depends. We formulate the optimal placement of sensors in smart parking as an integer linear programming multi-objective problem optimizing the sensor network engineering efficiency in terms of coverage and lifetime maximization, as well as its economic gain in terms of the number of sensors deployed for a specific coverage and lifetime. We propose an exact solution to the node placement problem using single-step and two-step solutions implemented in the Mosel language based on the Xpress-MPsuite of libraries. Experimental results reveal the relative efficiency of the single-step compared to the two-step model on different performance parameters. These results are consolidated by simulation results, which reveal that our solution outperforms a random placement in terms of both energy consumption, delay and throughput achieved by a smart parking network.

There are many challenges remain. Taking advantage of IPv6, IPv6 over Low-power personal area networks (6LoWPANs) implemented on resource constrained devices makes the connection possible and easier. This paper is contributing on constructing architecture of the end-to-end communication system based on 6LoWPAN gateway, which enabled convergence of IPv6 network and low-power wireless networking, featuring encapsulating 6LoWPAN adapter layer in a Network adapter driver (NAD) of personal computer. Using real commercial deployment, the result of application test bed shows that the IPv6 hosts could be interactive with IP-based sensor nodes through 6LoWPAN gateway with acceptable latency and packet loss.

One popular IoT scenario features a smart home service gateway, which becomes the central point of user's home environment facilitating a multitude of tasks. Given that most IoT devices connected to residential gateway are small-scale and battery-powered, the key challenge is to extend their lifetime without recharging/replacing batteries. To this end, a novel radio technology named Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has recently been completed to enable energy-efficient data transfer. Another inspiring innovation is the capability of sensors to harvest wireless energy in their local environment. In this work, we envision a scenario where many in-home sensors are communicating with a smart gateway over the BLE protocol, while at the same time harvesting RF energy transmitted from the gateway wirelessly via a dedicated radio interface. We thoroughly investigate performance limitations of such wireless energy transfer interface (WETI) with dynamic analytical model and with important practical considerations. Our methodology delivers the upper bound on WETI operation coupled with BLE-based communication, which characterizes ultimate system performance over the class of practical radio and energy resource management algorithms.

Also, a growing number of consumer electronic and mobile devices are becoming capable of taking the role of a health gateway, thus operating as a data collector for PHDs. In this context, we present a system that enables PHDs to share information in home networks and with the Internet based on a new Internet of Things protocol, namely the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). CoAP is used along with the IEEE 11073 family of standards, which is the main exchange data model for PHD communication. We discuss how the proposed system can be integrated to other connected health systems, such as a Universal Plug and Play healthcare system. We detail how the CoAP communication model was adapted to the IEEE 11073 model. We also present a real PHD prototype and its evaluation results. These results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed solution, showing how its network overhead is around 50% lighter when compared to other protocols. Finally, we tested the proposed solution based on different scenarios, including a proof-of-concept integration with a service in the cloud, using different wireless physical interfaces.

The potentials lie in the creation of an advanced ICT infrastructure with support for connected and entangled services possibilities including technologies for efficient communication in an Internet of Things (5G) contexts. In this paper we discuss some of the key challenges that exist in the smart city and smart home networks in the light of possible 5G-solutions. Focus is on deploying cognitive radio technologies (5G) which enables the smart city networks to support interconnected infrastructure elements, to handle big-data from the smart homes, and to be compatible with existing infrastructures. The considered cognitive radio technology is based on pre-coded OFDM which offers the needed flexibility to deal with the key challenges found in the smart home networks. Thus, it is able to overcome the WiFi interferences and the wall penetration losses for a limited power cost. By simulation it has been found that power saving in the range of 10-23 % can be achieved for a small bandwidth cost. Additionally, it has been found that the choice of the smart home gateway location can change its power consumption with 99 %. The developed simulator incorporates interferences, wall losses, and packet error rates, which is elaborated in this paper.

SENSORS			English	Article						Internet of Things; industrial networks; machine to machine; smart grid; wireless sensor network	MONITORING-SYSTEM; SMART; ENVIRONMENT; INTERNET; STANDARD	The concept of the Internet of Things is rapidly becoming a reality, with many applications being deployed within industrial and consumer sectors. At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.

J	Liu, CB; Qiu, JM				Liu, Chibiao; Qiu, Jinming			Study on a Secure Wireless Data Communication in Internet of Things Applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						Internet of things; Wireless security attacks; Secure data transmission; Performance overhead	SENSORS; CLOUD	Internet of Things (IOT) applications are being widely deployed in many industrial and social fields, and guarantee of the safety of IOT related data transmission is the key for successful IOT related businesses. Our study provides a new way to secure the data transmission of the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) related IOT applications. The WLAN-based IOT application is mainly composed of WLAN sensor nodes, the WLAN gateway, transmission networks and the data service center. The WLAN gateway collects data from sensor nodes in real-time and sends the collected data to the data service center via the transmission network. Since many WLAN-based IOT applications involve critical services, such as power, water, industry productions and health care, the data transmission between the wireless gateway and the data service center is required to be secured for preventing crypto attacks, such as traffic analysis, man in the middle, session hijack, unauthorized access, masquerading, eavesdropping, replay, tampering and forgery. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to secure the data transmission of the WLAN-based IOT applications. Meanwhile, we conduct experiments and theoretical analysis to study the performance of the proposed integrated security approach; it shows that the integrated approach is a new and effective way to secure the data transmission of the WLAN related IOT applications.

Tharinda Nishantha; Arai, Daisuke; Ogishi, Tomohiko			Service Environment for Smart Wireless Devices: An M2M Gateway Selection Scheme	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						M2M service architecture; M2M communication; M2M gateway selection; Bluetooth smart device; energy consumption; Internet of Things	INTERNET	Wireless standardization activities, such as the Bluetooth V4.x (Bluetooth smart), have led to an explosive growth in innovative short-range wireless devices capable of providing various services to assist everyday life. Allowing machine-to-machine (M2M) communication between these M2M devices also presents new commercial service opportunities. M2M service providers, including telecom carriers, may need to establish new networks to accommodate M2M interactions while identifying new business opportunities. Typically, M2M devices need another capable device, such as a smartphone, to act as a gateway to connect to the Internet to operate at their full potential. We propose a novel scheme in which any Internet-enabled device in the vicinity can act as an M2M gateway for M2M devices. This eliminates the need for the M2M device user to also own a smartphone or an Internet-enabled device to obtain services such as online-to-offline. This scheme faces new challenges, such as how to identify the best M2M gateway for a required service and the QoS. This paper proposes a method to select an M2M gateway from a large number of possibilities in order to increase service availability while also obtaining better signal strength for higher QoS. The methods presented are evaluated in terms of their performance, including energy consumption, and a service deployment guideline is derived using real-world data collected at an exhibition, which gave encouraging results.

J	Li, HT; Kun, G; Lu, YM; Li, YH				Li Haitao; Guo Kun; Lu Yueming; Li Yonghua			A User-Centric Approach to Activity Recognition and Guidance in Semantic Smart Home	CHINA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Internet of Things; smart home; activity recognition; activity guidance; semantic model	SENSOR NETWORK; ONTOLOGY; MODEL	Wireless smart home system is to facilitate people's lives and it trend to adopt a more intelligent way to provide services. It is very desirable in the recent SH market for the system to recognize users' behaviors and automatically response the corresponding activities to satisfy users' actual demands. However, activity models in the existing approaches are usually defined separately through knowledge-driven methods. These approaches cause that the activity models can't be matched with the services dynamically. To address the problem, we develop the semantic association model and a novel approach of activity recognition and guidance is presented. In our approach, the smart devices and users' requirements are described by semantic models. When the requirements are detected and understood, smart gateway can provide appropriate services, achieving activity assistance. The semantic association model allows all related elements in smart home connect with each other logically. The approach has been implemented and the results show that the success rate of the approach based on semantic association model is higher than 33% at average as compared to the approach based on predefined models. The proposed approach can effectively help people who are in trouble with learning or remembering in the common life.

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.

J	Zhu, DQ; Xu, L; Zhu, YH; Tian, XZ				Zhu, Deqing; Xu, Lin; Zhu, Yi-hua; Tian, Xianzhong			Implementing PMIPv6 Protocol Based on Extended Service Set for IEEE 802.11 Infrastructure WLAN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							MOBILITY MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; POWER; IP	With the popularity of IEEE 802.11 based wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) portable devices, it becomes increasingly significant to support the mobile users carrying Wi-Fi devices to access the Internet of Things (IoT) so that the communications between the mobile users and the smart objects deployed in the IoT stay uninterrupted when the mobile users are in movement. A scheme using Extended Service Set-(ESS-) based architecture is presented to implement the proxy mobile IPv6 protocol, that is, PMIPv6, for IEEE 802.11 infrastructure Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The key signaling packets together with their time sequences for the mobility management in the proposed scheme are proposed. Moreover, the handoff delay in the proposed scheme is derived, through which the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed. Numerical analysis indicates that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms the existing scheme that uses the Basic Service Set (BSS) based architecture in terms of handoff delay in the case when the delay between Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and local mobile anchor (LMA) is relatively large.

J	Jung, SW; Jung, S				Jung, Seung Wook; Jung, Souhwan			Secure Bootstrapping and Rebootstrapping for Resource-Constrained Thing in Internet of Things	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							AUTHENTICATED KEY EXCHANGE; GUESSING ATTACKS; EFFICIENT; PROTOCOLS	In Internet of Things, secure key establishment and building trust relationship between the thing and the home gateway (or the controller) in home network or Body Area Network are extremely important. Without the guarantee of establishment of key and trust relationship, the traffic over the Internet of Things network cannot be presumed secure. Also, when the home gateway, which knows the shared secret key, is out of order and the new gateway should be installed, the secure key establishment and building trust relationship are also very important because this scenario is likely to happen in real world. In addition, the thing is resource-constrained device, so it is difficult when secure key establishment and building trust relationship involve Public Key Infrastructure. To address these problems, this paper presents user-friendly bootstrapping and rebootstrapping schemes in the context of Internet of Thing using the human memorable password. The proposed schemes do not require a special hardware module on the thing or special equipment for bootstrapping and rebootstrapping. All these properties make the proposed scheme cost-effective and easy to use.

J	Wang, XH				Wang, Xiaohui			The architecture design of the wearable health monitoring system based on internet of things technology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND UTILITY COMPUTING			English	Article						internet of things; wearable; health monitoring system; architecture		Ageing societies will have to rely increasingly on wearable health monitoring systems to monitor and protect health of the aged in real time. This paper considers that the architecture of the wearable health monitoring system is mainly composed by wearable sensor system, network transmission system and the information processing system on the basis of the three-layer architecture of the internet of things. The data collected by wearable sensor systems would be transmitted through Bluetooth technology to a gateway for providing real-time monitoring. In the family life scope, home computer is usually selected as the home gateway. And when we are out, we can choose intelligent mobile phone as the mobile gateway. The physiological information and data acquired through network are transmitted in real time to the database server. As emerging technologies such as the internet of things are gradually applied to medical monitoring, the wearable health monitoring system will develop into an intelligent, networked and multifunctional one in the future.

A gateway is often employed as infrastructure in this scenario, acting as the data collector, the relay and the agency of the initial multisensor fusion, and thus must be able to handle as many concurrent requests as possible from diverse sensors of different vendors. This study proposes a high-performance scheduling model with a cloud-supported caching mechanism for the gateway of the cloud sensor system-based smart-living. Scheduling and caching optimization are performed by 0-1 programming combined with the periodic task models. Correlation analyses of the simulated results determine the most effective factors to the performance, and the performance tests with the selected factors show that a gateway with 2.4 G-uniCPU/4 G-memory/300 G-harddisk can support the system with one million sensors registered in the cloud and 5000 concurrent live sensors through it, with a 25x gain throughput improvement compared to the traditional application-type scheduling.

Bluetooth LE is a rapidly emerging ultra-low-power radio technology expected to be incorporated in billions of IoT devices in the next few years. Consequently, it is particularly important to specify Internet connectivity solutions for Bluetooth LE. In this article we present such solutions based on the ongoing standardization work in the IETF and Bluetooth Special Interest Group. We prove the feasibility of a complete IP-based protocol stack on constrained devices and illustrate its performance, highlighting key trade-offs. In addition, we discuss gateway operation covering global IPv6 connectivity and proxy-cache functionality.

While existing technologies have harvested power from ambient RF sources (e.g.. TV broadcasts), they require a dedicated gateway (like an RFID reader) for Internet connectivity. We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RE-powered devices with the Internet. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show Wi-Fi Backscatter's feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and demonstrate the first communication link between an RE-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices including Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys Routers, and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters. We believe that this new capability can pave the way for the rapid deployment and adoption of RE-powered devices and achieve ubiquitous connectivity via nearby mobile devices that are Wi-Fi enabled.

F.; Han, Guangjie			Wireless Sensor Networks in IPv4/IPv6 Transition Scenarios	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Ubiquitous computing; Mobile computing; Internet of things; 6LoWPAN; Wireless sensor network		The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) concept was appeared in the middle of 90s and have been a subject under intensive research in the past few years. Several factors have contributed to this, but the potential for application of WSNs in almost every aspect of day-to-day life is the predominant one. This type of networks has been developed using proprietary solutions instead of standard solutions. More recently, the importance of standards motivated the use of IETF standards in WSNs, making the Internet integration easier. However, more efforts are necessary in order to provide a full integration. The WSNs use mainly IPv6 protocol, but the IPv4 is the predominant one in the Internet. As a consequence, IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms must be provided to allow the interaction between all Internet connected devices independently of the supported IP version. It is also critical to provide a standard application interface to make easier the application development and independently of the hardware platform used. The RESTfull Web services can provide this standard interface. So, combine RESTfull Web services with IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms can increase the WSN services dissemination. The transition mechanisms and the REST Web services are supported in the gateway in order to save the wireless sensor device resources'. The smartphone with Internet connectivity can also be the drive to the WSNs growth, because user-friendly applications can be used to retrieve and collect sensed data. This paper proposes a solution based on REST web services to permit the interaction between a mobile application and the IPv6 compliant WSN.	[Oliveira, Luis M. L.; Rodrigues, Joel J. P.

J	Dong, M; Zeng, X; Bi, S; Huang, QY; Pan, XW				Dong Min; Zeng Xiao; Bi Sheng; Huang Quanyong; Pan Xuwei			Design and implementation of heterogeneous IOT gateway based on dynamic priority scheduling algorithm	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						Data transmission; gateway; IOT; scheduling		In practice, IOT (Internet of things) gateways are often used between sensor networks and the Internet to provide advanced services such as device monitoring and control. Sensor networks are connected to the Internet via these gateways based on various transmission protocols. In particular, the main features of IOT gateways are reliability, high real-time, security and so on. This paper proposes a heterogeneous IOT gateway based on dynamic priority scheduling algorithm. This gateway realizes data conversion and transformation between the Internet and sensor networks as well as several kinds of communication protocol: RS485, Bluetooth, CAN, Zigbee and GSM. To ensure the data security and reliability for IOT gateway, some higher-level protocols are designed and implemented on the gateway. A dynamic priority scheduling algorithm of a real-time system is also used in the gateway to address the problem of data concurrency and improve real-time performance by efficiently scheduling tasks. Simulation results reveal that the gateway realizes the data transmission between sensor networks and the Internet using specific higher-level protocols and response within a very short delay, achieving the goal of addressing the problem of data concurrency.

J	Turkanovic, M; Brumen, B; Holbl, M				Turkanovic, Muhamed; Brumen, Bostjan; Hoelbl, Marko			A novel user authentication and key agreement scheme for heterogeneous ad hoc wireless sensor networks, based on the Internet of Things notion	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Wireless sensor network; Ad hoc; Mutual authentication; Key agreement; Smart card; Internet of Things	MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION; DESIGN; DEPLOYMENT; PROTOCOL	The idea of the Internet of Things (IOT) notion is that everything within the global network is accessible and interconnected. As such Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) play a vital role in such an environment, since they cover a wide application field. Such interconnection can be seen from the aspect of a remote user who can access a single desired sensor node from the WSN without the necessity of firstly connecting with a gateway node (GWN). This paper focuses on such an environment and proposes a novel user authentication and key agreement scheme for heterogeneous ad hoc wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme enables a remote user to securely negotiate a session key with a general sensor node, using a lightweight key agreement protocol. The proposed scheme ensures mutual authentication between the user, sensor node, and the gateway node (GWN), although the GWN is never contacted by the user. The proposed scheme has been adapted to the resource-constrained architecture of the WSN, thus it uses only simple hash and XOR computations. Our proposed scheme tackles these risks and the challenges posed by the IOT, by ensuring high security and performance features. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cubo, J; Nieto, A; Pimentel, E				Cubo, Javier; Nieto, Adrian; Pimentel, Ernesto			A Cloud-Based Internet of Things Platform for Ambient Assisted Living	SENSORS			English	Article						ambient intelligence; ambient assisted living; Internet of Things; service-oriented; cloud computing; devices; sensors; services; gateway	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; CONTEXT-AWARE MIDDLEWARE; HEALTH-CARE; SERVICES; ARCHITECTURE; INTELLIGENCE; PEOPLE; ACCESS	A common feature of ambient intelligence is that many objects are inter-connected and act in unison, which is also a challenge in the Internet of Things. There has been a shift in research towards integrating both concepts, considering the Internet of Things as representing the future of computing and communications. However, the efficient combination and management of heterogeneous things or devices in the ambient intelligence domain is still a tedious task, and it presents crucial challenges. Therefore, to appropriately manage the inter-connection of diverse devices in these systems requires: (1) specifying and efficiently implementing the devices (e.g., as services); (2) handling and verifying their heterogeneity and composition; and (3) standardizing and managing their data, so as to tackle large numbers of systems together, avoiding standalone applications on local servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a platform to manage the integration and behavior-aware orchestration of heterogeneous devices as services, stored and accessed via the cloud, with the following contributions: (i) we describe a lightweight model to specify the behavior of devices, to determine the order of the sequence of exchanged messages during the composition of devices; (ii) we define a common architecture using a service-oriented standard environment, to integrate heterogeneous devices by means of their interfaces, via a gateway, and to orchestrate them according to their behavior; (iii) we design a framework based on cloud computing technology, connecting the gateway in charge of acquiring the data from the devices with a cloud platform, to remotely access and monitor the data at run-time and react to emergency situations; and (iv) we implement and generate a novel cloud-based IoT platform of behavior-aware devices as services for ambient intelligence systems, validating the whole approach in real scenarios related to a specific ambient assisted living application.

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years 1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT.

Driven by the vision of service oriented architecture (SOA), this paper proposed a carrier class Internet of Things (IoT) service architecture named asMUSE. MUSE integratesWSN with IMS OSE framework to enable theWSN services to be operable and manageable. Also sensor web enablement (SWE) framework is adopted to shield the heterogeneity of different WSNs. MUSE consists of two key entities-MUSE Enabler and MUSE Gateway. On the one hand, the architecture promotes the node manageability and enriches the diversity of high level task planning flexibility. On the other hand, the architecture extends the telecom context-aware service and realizes service operability and network scalability. Moreover, the key components of the architecture and the detailed service procedure were introduced in the paper. Besides, an intelligent building prototype with 20 nodes was illustrated and the feasibility and performance of MUSE were verified at last.

Opposite to Internet world, things usually belong to resource-challenged environments where energy, data throughput, and computing resources are scarce. Building upon existing standards in the field such as IEEE1451 and ZigBee and rooted in context semantics, this paper proposes CTP (Communication Things Protocol) as a protocol specification to allow interoperability among things with different communication standards as well as simplicity and functionality to build IoT systems. Also, this paper proposes the use of the IoT gateway as a fundamental component in IoT architectures to provide seamless connectivity and interoperability among things and connect two different worlds to build the IoT: the Things world and the Internet world. Both CTP and IoT gateway constitute a middleware content-centric architecture presented as the mechanism to achieve a balance between the intrinsic limitations of things in the physical world and what is required from them in the virtual world. Said middleware content-centric architecture is implemented within the frame of two European projects targeting smart environments and proving said CTP's objectives in real scenarios.

Here, the authors focus on energy resources for smart grids and smart buildings, investigating how a smart grid infrastructure accesses the energy resources in a smart building to obtain or control data. The energy service interface (ESI), which plays a communication gateway role at the boundary of a customer building, hasn't received much study. The authors examine its design principles for enabling fine-grained access, implement and deploy an ESI prototype, and illustrate interactive energy services between the grid infrastructure and smart buildings.

Interconnection Framework for mHealth and Remote Monitoring Based on the Internet of Things	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Internet of things; mHealth; communication architecture; remote monitoring; ambient assisted living	SERVICE SYSTEM; WIRELESS; TECHNOLOGY; MOBILE; NETWORKS; DEMENTIA; M2M; IP	Communication and information access defines the basis to reach a personalized health end-to-end framework. Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient. The data is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem. This evaluates for the proposed protocol the data aggregation mechanism level, Round-Trip delay Time, impact of the distance, and the impact of the security. It has been concluded that secure continuous monitoring is feasible with the use of the proposed YOAPY aggregation mechanisms and the capabilities from the proposed interconnection framework.

J	Yu, H; He, JS; Zhang, T; Xiao, P; Zhang, YQ				Yu, Hong; He, Jingsha; Zhang, Ting; Xiao, Peng; Zhang, Yuqiang			Enabling end-to-end secure communication between wireless sensor networks and the Internet	WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); web of things (WoT); wisdom web of things (W2T); wireless sensor networks (WSNs); security	AUTHENTICATION; SIGNCRYPTION; SCHEMES; THINGS	In the paradigms of the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as the evolving Web of Things (WoT) and the emerging Wisdom Web of Things (W2T), not only can the data collected by the sensor nodes (i.e., the things) in the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) be transmitted to and processed at Internet nodes and subsequently transformed into information, knowledge, wisdom and eventually into services to serve humans, but human users can also access, control and manage the sensor nodes in the WSNs through nodes in the Internet. Since data are the basis for enabling applications and services in W2T, it becomes imperative that enabling technologies for end-to-end security be developed to secure data communication between Internet user nodes and sensor server nodes to protect the exchange of data. However, traditional security protocols developed for the Internet rely mostly on symmetric authentication and key management based on public key algorithms, thus are deemed to be unsuitable for WSNs due to resource constraints in the sensor nodes. Specifically, acting as the server nodes in this scenario, sensor nodes cannot take on the heavy duty like regular servers in the Internet. Meanwhile, current security mechanisms developed for WSNs have mainly focused on the establishment of keys between neighboring nodes at the link layer and thus are not considered to be effective for end-to-end security in the W2T scenario. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end secure communication scheme for W2T in WSNs in which we follow an asymmetric approach for authentication and key management using signcryption and symmetric key encryption. In our proposed scheme, a great part of the work for authentication and access control is shifted to a gateway between a WSN and the Internet to reduce the burden and energy consumption in the sensor nodes. In addition, our scheme can ensure the privacy of user identities and key negotiation materials, and denial of service (DoS) attacks targeted at the sensor nodes can be effectively blocked at the gateway. We will also conduct quantitative analysis and an experiment to show that our proposed scheme can enhance the effectiveness of end-to-end security while reducing the cost of sensor nodes in terms of computation, communication and storage overhead as well as the latency of handshaking compared to similar schemes that are based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

Most existing middleware for sensor networks lack attention for integrating services into a generic architecture and present inflexibility that make them useless in the context of industrial solutions of Internet of Things. To solve this problem, we proposed a new middleware deployment model and present layered and distributed architecture utilizing our "Ends to the Middle" approach. Actual application of middleware demonstrates that our proposed architecture is highly modular and efficient, offers good performance in complex application scenarios of Internet of Things.

Multiplication and Squaring with Shifting Primes on OpenRISC Processors with Hardware Multiplier	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Security GT; Internet of Things; Elliptic Curve Cryptography; Shifting Primes; OpenRISC	J.UCS SPECIAL-ISSUE; INTERNET; SECURITY; THINGS	Cryptographic primitives are the key component in the security protocols to support the authentication, key management and secure communication establishment. For that reason, this work presents the optimization of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography through the usage of Shifting Primes for constrained devices. Specifically, this presents the optimization for the chipsets JN51XX from NXP/Jennic, which are based on OpenRISC architecture and offer a class-2 constrained device. In details, Shifting Primes features have allowed to optimize the multiplication and squaring through a double accumulator and shifting reduction. This work is ancillary to the previous works about optimization of Shifting Primes for class-1 constrained devices. The optimization of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography for the class-2 constrained devices brings several opportunities for realistic scenarios, where the security interoperability between a gateway (class-2 device) and end-nodes ( class 1 devices) is a major requirement.

With the new developed IoT (Internet of Things) technology, remote authorized users are allowed to access reliable sensor nodes to obtain data and even are allowed to send commands to the nodes in the WSN. Because of the resource constrained nature of sensor nodes, it is important to design a secure, effective and lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme. The gateway node (GWN) plays a crucial role in the WSN as all data transmitted to the outside network must pass through it. We propose a temporal-credential-based mutual authentication scheme among the user. GWN and the sensor node. With the help of the password-based authentication, GWN can issue a temporal credential to each user and sensor node. For a user, his/her temporal credential can be securely protected and stored openly in a smart card. For a sensor node, its temporal credential is related to its identity and must privately stored in its storage medium. Furthermore, with the help of GWN, a lightweight key agreement scheme is proposed to embed into our protocol. The protocol only needs hash and XOR computations. The results of security and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides relatively more security features and high security level without increasing too much overhead of communication, computation and storage. It is realistic and well adapted for resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently, technology is integrated in all objects of our daily life. TCP/IP let us monitor our home in real time and check ubiquitously if something is happening at home. Bearing in mind this idea, we have developed a low-cost system, which can be used in any type of electrical household appliance that takes information from the appliance and posts the information to the Twitter Social network. Several sensors placed in the household appliances gather the sensed data and send them wired or wirelessly, depending on the case, using small and cheap devices to a gateway located in the home. This gateway takes decisions, based on the received data, and sends notifications to Twitter. We have developed a software application that takes the values and decides when to issue an alarm to the registered users (Twitter friends of our smart home). The performance of our system has been measured taking into account the home network (using IEEE 802.3u and IEEE 802.11g) and the data publishing in Twitter. As a result, we have generated an original product and service for any electrical household appliance, regardless of the model and manufacturer, that helps home users improve their quality of life. The paper also shows that there is no system with the same innovative features like the ones presented in this paper.

In particular, objects embedding Human Machine Interaction (HMI), such as mobile devices and, increasingly, connected vehicles, home appliances, urban interactive infrastructures, etc., may not only be conceived as sources of sensor information, but, through interaction with their users, they can also produce highly valuable context-aware human-generated observations. We believe that the great promise offered by combining and sharing all of the different sources of information available can be realized through the integration of HMI and Semantic Sensor Web technologies. This paper presents a technological framework that harmonizes two of the most influential HMI and Sensor Web initiatives: the W3C's Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces (MMI) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) with its semantic extension, respectively. Although the proposed framework is general enough to be applied in a variety of connected objects integrating HMI, a particular development is presented for a connected car scenario where drivers' observations about the traffic or their environment are shared across the Semantic Sensor Web. For implementation and evaluation purposes an on-board OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) architecture was built, integrating several available HMI, Sensor Web and Semantic Web technologies. A technical performance test and a conceptual validation of the scenario with potential users are reported, with results suggesting the approach is sound.

J	De Poorter, E; Moerman, I; Demeester, P				De Poorter, Eli; Moerman, Ingrid; Demeester, Piet			Enabling direct connectivity between heterogeneous objects in the internet of things through a network-service-oriented architecture	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Internet of things; Network architecture; Clean slate; Heterogeneity	FUTURE INTERNET; VIRTUALIZATION	In a future internet of things, an increasing number of everyday objects are connected with each other. These objects can be very diverse in terms of the used network protocols and communication technologies, which leads to a wild growth of co-located networking technologies. Unfortunately, current consumer items are not designed to communicate with co-located devices that use different communication technologies. In addition, commercially available internet of things devices, such as sensor nodes, often use vendor-specific propriety network solutions. As a result, communication between these devices is only possible through the use of gateway nodes, resulting in inefficient use of the wireless medium. To remedy this situation, this paper discusses which features are required to integrate such a diverse number of heterogeneous objects into a single internet of things. In addition, the paper introduces the IDRA architecture, which is designed specifically to enable connectivity between heterogeneous resource-constrained objects. The IDRA architecture has the following advantages. (1) IDRA can connect co-located objects directly, without the need for complex translation gateways. (2) The architecture is clean slate, but supports backward compatibility with existing deployments. (3) Due to its low memory footprint, the architecture can be used in resource-constrained objects. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the IDRA architecture and discusses the feasibility of introducing IDRA in existing networks.
