J	Pan, MS; Li, KY				Pan, Meng-Shiuan; Li, Kuan-Ying			ezNavi: An Easy-to-Operate Indoor Navigation System Based on Pedestrian Dead Reckoning and Crowdsourced User Trajectories	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Crowdsourcing; inertial sensors; indoor navigation; pedestrian dead reckoning; smartphone	LOCALIZATION; BLUETOOTH; ALGORITHM	Recently, researchers have paid attention to designing indoor navigation services for smartphone users. Conventional indoor navigation systems highly rely on well-known indoor information and prior training phase for localization, and thus it is time- and labor-consuming to bootstrap indoor navigation services. Without too much prior configurations, the proposed indoor navigation system, called ezNavi, utilizes trajectory information (reported by users) to generate indoor pathway and point of interests (POIs). The proposed system consists of a front-end mobile application (APP) and a back-end server. The mobile APP infers users' walking trajectories according to sensory values from smartphones. The back-end server processes crowdsourced trajectories with the help of deployed Bluetooth low energy beacon devices, and then produces pathways of the indoor environment. After obtaining more trajectories, the ezNavi can further refine the derived pathways to provide more efficient guidance services for users. Our experiment and prototyping results reveal that the ezNavi can effectively derive users' walking trajectories, produces indoor pathways, and indicates directions for users.

Many research groups are studying pervasive solutions to continuously and unobtrusively monitor fragile subjects at their homes, reducing health-care costs and supporting medical diagnosis. Among the several behavioral aspects which clinicians are interested in monitoring, anomalous behaviors while performing activities of daily living are of great importance. In this work, we aim at improving the state of the art on this topic by enabling the recognition of fine-grained anomalies by detecting specific object manipulations. We attach tiny Bluetooth Low Energy accelerometers to several household objects in order to detect which manipulations are performed by the inhabitant on which object. Detected manipulations, combined with data from other environmental sensors deployed in the home, are used to infer ADLs and fine-grained abnormal behaviors. Preliminary results on a dataset with hundreds of complex activities captured in a smarthome environment show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Printed, metallic thermoelectric generators integrated with pipe insulation for powering wireless sensors	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Thermoelectric generator; Screen printing; Internet of things; Pipe insulation; Wireless sensing network	FILMS; POLYMER	Internet of Things (IoT), coupled with advanced analytics, is poised to revolutionize manufacturing maintenance and efficiency. However, a practical route to powering these many IoT devices remains unclear. In this work, flexible thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are fabricated from low cost, screen printed silver and nickel inks before being integrated into a novel form factor device based on commercial steam pipe insulation. Through optimization of internal resistances and total device design, this 420-junction TEG device produces 308 mu W of power at a temperature difference of 127 K. This is sufficient to power a temperature sensing circuit with wireless communication capabilities. In this report we demonstrate that, after an initial 4 h of charging, this TEG can power a standard RFduino microcontroller for 10 min while sending temperature readings every 30 s via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a cell phone. Additional optimization and scaling could further increase system efficiency and provide a viable route to powering an industrial wireless sensing network (WSN).

Most patients take antiepileptic drugs to reduce their seizures. Among them, nearly one-third of the patients are drug-resistant epilepsy. The alternative treatment is the resection surgery of removing the epileptogenic zone. However, all above patients will still have some seizures, which will influence the patients' quality-of-life, and further introduce danger and inconvenience to patients and people around. This paper presents the design and develop of the smart headband for epileptic seizure detection. The headband consists of a textile headband with flexible print circuit (FPC) inside, and fabric electrodes on it. The whole system includes the following circuits: an analog front-end circuitry for electroencephalography (EEG) record, an epileptic seizure detection System-on-Chip (SoC), and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Chip. The result of designed circuits yields a compact and low-power design of smart headband for epileptic seizure detection which is suitable for wearable usage.

There is a lack of accuracy and robustness in current indoor positioning system. This paper designs and implements an indoor positioning system based on iBeacon. We adopt Gaussian filter and Unscented Kalman filter method to robustly extract strong signals from iBeacon device. With the extracted signals, we compared them with-in database. The goal of this paper is to design and implement a mobile-based indoor location system which has the mobile applications with the Bluetooth Low Energy technology based on the iBeacon. Using a mobile terminal our system can show position results. Moreover, our system can run on both Android systems and IOS ones. Our method has better performance compared with WiFi method. The experimental results demonstrates that the error is only within 4 meters and our system can achieve accurate and robust positioning.

Design and noise analysis of an unbalanced gate-boosted common-gate low-noise amplifier (LNA) is presented, showing 50% lower power dissipation compared with the conventional balanced topology. Improved linearity is achieved thanks to channel-selection, consisting of two complex poles centered at 2 MHz IF. The first complex pole is embedded in the passive down-conversion mixer for improved frequency selectivity in front of the baseband voltage amplifier. Built in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed front-end occupies an active area of 0.175 mm(2), it is supplied with 1 V and consumes only 400 mu W, while showing a minimum noise figure (NF) of 6.8 dB and an out-of-band (OOB) IIP3 of -0.35 dBm. The performance meets Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) requirements and is competitive with other sub-mW receivers.

Especially recognizing gestures with touch-less technology has several advantages including, for example, the possibility of working with gloves either outside or in sterile environments. In this work, we present a tiny machine learning neural network model exploiting a novel, miniaturized and low power Time of flight (ToF)-sensor from STMicroelectronics. The algorithm is based on a combination of temporal convolutional networks and is optimized to work on an embedded small and low power ARM cortex-M4 processor with a few kilo Byte of RAM, as employed in every recent Bluetooth Low Energy module. A dataset has been collected with the ToF sensor for training and evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The model has been evaluated for accuracy and a trade-off between computational resources and accuracy is presented. The gesture recognition achieves a very high accuracy of over 96% over 6 different gestures.

Each AirTag device contains a Nordic nRF52832 chip for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Near Field Communication (NFC) connectivity, as well as Apple's U1 chip for Ultra-wideband (UWB) fine ranging. In this paper, we analyze the AirTag hardware and firmware in detail and present attacks that also affect the whole AirTag ecosystem. After performing a voltage glitching attack on the nRF chip, we extract and reverse engineer the main firmware. We add firmware functionality, change capabilities, and demonstrate cloning AirTags.

Herein, a hierarchical polyvinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP)/ZnO composite nanaofiber piezoelectric sensor with highly sensitivity has been prepared through epitaxial growing ZnO nanosheets on the surface of electrospun PVDF-HFP nanofibers. Systematic investigations have shown that their optimum pressure sensing performance with a sensitivity of 1.9 V kPa(-1) and a short response time of 20 ms are achieved for forces from 0.02 to 0.5 N with excellent durability and stability up to 5000 cycles. Moreover, this sensor can precisely detect the imperceptible changes in player's motions to avoid injury from overtraining. Additionally, a Bluetooth-low-energy that tracks player's workout and transmits the output signals wirelessly to a smartphone app is utilized. The study provides a feasible approach for high-precision detecting and safety monitoring in the fields of medical, rehabilitation medicine, and workout security.

In order to enable the management (actuation and control) of equipment via BLE, each BLE network address must be linked with the physical location of equipment. However, the manual location identification effort is labour-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce our basic idea to handle this issue and show a preliminary experimental result. The idea is to design semi-automatic position estimation technique by leveraging the change in RSSI of BLE devices during walking. Our method requires only one tester to carry a smartphone and walk around the building to collect the RSSI. We deployed 10 BLE devices to conduct the preliminary experiment in a single room. The result shows that the locations of 80% BLE devices are correctly identified.

Navigating free of signal reception problems throughout a building when one has never visited that place before is a challenge tackled with indoors localization. Using Bluetooth Low Energy(1) (BLE) beacons (either iBeacon or Eddystone formats) is the medium to accomplish that. Indeed, different purpose oriented applications can be designed, developed and shaped towards the needs of any person in the context of a certain building. This work presents a series of post-processing filters to enhance the outcome of the estimated position applying trilateration as the main and straightforward technique to locate someone within a building. A later evaluation tries to give enough evidence around the feasibility of this indoor localization technique. A mobile app should be everything a user would need to have within a building in order to navigate inside.

The proposed smart wearable system is built using the fewest sensors necessary for gesture recognition. Thus, motion sensors are placed on the thumb and index finger to detect finger motions. Another sensor is placed on the back of the hand to measure hand movement. A total of six gestures are analyzed via hand and finger movement using a dynamic time-warping method. Gestures include "swipe right," "swipe left," "zoom in," "zoom out," "rotate left," and "rotate right." An Android-based mobile device application simulator measures gesture recognition effectiveness. Gestures are analyzed using a trained recognition model. Once a gesture is detected, it is transmitted to the mobile application via Bluetooth low energy communication. Received gestures then trigger corresponding commands, as specified in the mobile application. The proposed smart wearable system can detect gestures at mean accuracy of 93.19 %.

The technology is continuously improving and it is now possible for consumers to buy highly durable beacons for a reasonable price. The main use of these beacons is to be harnessed by context-aware software, as such, applications requiring localization can benefit from beacon technology. However, the reliability and accuracy of the location information is rather crucial when used for ambient intelligence in healthcare domain. Most systems currently rely only on received signal strength indication (RSSI) that may not be highly reliable in that they are highly susceptible to diffraction, multipath propagation, angle-of-arrival, lack of line-of-sight and absorption by human body. In this paper, we propose to investigate the use of two features in addition to mean RSSI. The new algorithm presented in the paper improve the localization accuracy from 6.2% to 9.14% over simple proximity localization.

We consider a system where mobile devices send periodic BLE beacons (consisting of the devices' identity) and the infrastructure nodes are required to track these devices to gather information about the users behavior in order to improve customized services provided to the user. For such systems, we propose the design and present a prototype (on CSR 1010 kits) where location detection and tracking are done via vision-based approach assisted by the RF observations. Features, extensions and optimizations of this system are discussed in detail. Emphasis is provided on in-network processing to disambiguate the multiple objects detected using image processing and assign the right identities as received via BLE beacons to the right objects. Further, the approach provides reduction in the beacon generation rate from the user devices, thereby improving the battery lifetime of the end devices.

In order to learn about their perspectives on current airport accessibility, we conducted two focus groups that discussed their needs and experiences in-depth, as well as the potential role of assistive technologies. We found that independent navigation is a main challenge and severely impacts their overall experience. As a result, we equipped an airport with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon-based navigation system and performed a real-world study where users navigated routes relevant for their travel experience. We found that despite the challenging environment participants were able to complete their itinerary independently, presenting none to few navigation errors and reasonable timings. This study presents the first systematic evaluation posing BLE technology as a strong approach to increase the independence of visually impaired people in airports.

In this cases, location is computed relying on WiFi signals strength mapping. Recent Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) provides new opportunities to explore positioning. Indoor location identification plays a fundamental role as a business and personal level. At a business level, indoor location pinpointing where GPS signal is nonexistent is used to advise users and send push notifications (e.g., stores publicity, guide persons with special needs, or even for emergency evacuation). In this work is studied how BLE beacons radio signals can be used for indoor location scenarios, as well as their precision. The proposed study is performed inside the campus of Viseu Polytechnic Institute, using hundreds of students, each with his smart-phone, as proof of concept. Experimental results show that BLE allows having less than 1.5 meters error approximately 90% of the times. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was born to be low energy consumption, great efforts have been made in BLE-based backscatter systems, like FreeRider, RBLE. In this paper, we present BonusBlue, a BLE backscatter system that enables high-goodput communication with commercial BLE devices. BonusBlue tag generates BLE packets by modulating data on excitation signals and set up a data connection with BLE receiver using a state machine, thus achieving a high-goodput communication link. We present this state machine design and build a prototype of our tag using an FPGA, and evaluate its performance with BLE devices.

Replacing the traditional wired bus of the BMS by a wireless network brings several benefits. Since it is a critical application, the wireless network has to meet strict requirements such as low energy consumption, bounded latency, and high reliability. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of the IEEE Std 802.15.4 Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) Medium Access Control (MAC) mode running over the physical layer of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). To coordinate the data plane, we introduce a reliable and predictable schedule based on the Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN) Group Acknowledgement (GACK) method to dynamically manage the retransmissions. To validate our proposal, we implement a Wireless BMS (WBMS) network for the Renault Zoe battery pack. After conducting several experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms a traditional retransmission based strategy and achieve 100% of network reliability with bounded latency, and low energy consumption.

Thus, apps on the watch cannot directly sense movement changes in arbitrary body locations. This, in turn, severely limits training support services, contextual awareness and seamless interaction mechanisms. Our approach addresses this gap and connects the watch with two strategically placed inertial measurement units (IMUs) via bluetooth low energy (BLE). Our prototypical app for Wear OS receives orientation (quaternion) data and matches the sensors to the arm or leg segments using a flexible and simple procedure. We collected data from eight runners and used support vector machines (SVMs) to recognize different movements. Findings from our evaluation with different parameters indicate feasible recognition and low false-positive rates for two to three different movements, for both placements. Our approach can thus help to improve applications that support training and thus contributes to developing motion capture for personal use; it also enables movement-based interaction while running.

The system employs a robust wideband velocity measurement technique where the only required user inputs are: 1) when deployment should start, 2) how often to sample, and 3) what is the water type. The hardware is highly portable, measuring only 130 mm tall by 85 mm in diameter and weighing 1.0 kg in air. It communicates externally with Bluetooth Low Energy technology, and is powered by an embedded smart Li-Ion battery that is charged by induction. Three independent activation methods are implemented, including Near-Field Communication, and all communication controlled via a platform-independent Progressive Web App. Coupled with the ADCP is a deployment and recovery system allowing for single-person operation at depths up to 50 m.

In this regard, methods are being developed for highest accuracy indoor locating performance with least cost. Among these methods localization with fingerprinting is far more superior to other indoor localization methods as it uses the surrounding signals in the environment for accurate positioning and is available to most common mobile devices. In this work, indoor fingerprinting algorithms for localization of mobile devices based on Correlation Database (CDB) Filtering, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC) are compared. Results show that using adaptive GA or BB-BC < 3 m error of % 95 can be achieved with 4 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons distributed around a 40 m(2) testbed, compared to < 5.4 m for CDB Filtering.

In order to reduce the complexity and cost of the application development, we propose a device-independent formalization of the pass-by rendezvous of mobile entities in this paper. Specifically, we first define a pass-by rendezvous as a phenomenon, where two mobile entities are closed enough at a certain time. We then derive four properties from the definition to be satisfied within any pass-by systems. The properties allow indirect pass-by rendezvous between mobile entities with different devices. Finally, we apply the proposed method to two different practical systems (Bluetooth Low Energy and GPS). In the case study, we see how the pass-by rendezvous can be implemented in each system, and see how the indirect rendezvous across the two systems can be inferred using the proposed properties.

The proposed integer-N PLL is based on a dual loop Offset-PLL topology to achieve a fine frequency resolution similar to conventional fractional-N PLL. Not using a delta-sigma modulator (DSM) allows an expanded PLL bandwidth without deteriorating the overall noise performance. Implemented in 28 nm CMOS fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) technology, the proposed architecture requires a 22-MHz internal reference frequency while achieving a 2-MHz frequency resolution and a 3-MHz PLL bandwidth.

An architecture utilizing MQTT and an NSQL database was implemented. Historical traces of customer's physical behaviour acquired using beacons in the coffee shops were used to create clusters of similar customers.

Many techniques have been developed to predict locations through received BLE signal strength. Among them, signal fingerprinting is arguably the most accurate approach. However, this solution heavily relies on high quality fingerprint mapping constructed through costly site surveying. Moreover, such established fingerprints usually need to be updated frequently when the existing environment changes drastically. In this preliminary work, we propose an efficient fingerprinting surveying system prototype through leveraging the Ultra-Wide Band localization sensors to provide accurate location information as ground truth. Our system automatically collects and uploads locations and signal strengths with minimum human interference, and thus is able to quickly and continuously build fingerprints effortlessly. We demonstrate the accuracy of our fingerprinting approach and its benefits in enabling location estimation algorithms, which achieve high prediction accuracy through extensive experiments.

This shift provides operators with a high level of reliability and efficiency when dealing with highly dynamic distribution grids. Technically, this implies that the support for a bidirectional flow of data is critical to realizing smart grid operation, culminating in the demand for equipping grid entities (such as sensors) with communication and processing capabilities. Unfortunately, the retrofitting of brown-field electric substations in distribution grids with these capabilities is not straightforward -this scenario requires a solution that provides "industry-grade" Internet of Things capabilities at "consumer-grade" prices (e.g., off-the-shelf communication standards and hardware). In this paper, we discuss the particular challenge of precisely time-synchronized wireless data collection in secondary substations that at the same time supports on-site configuration by authorized maintenance personnel through a mobile application: to achieve this, we propose a combined implementation of IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy.

It is characterized by low costs, high energy efficiency and low intrusiveness to increase the acceptance of the users. Activity recognition is performed locally on a single small-sized wearable device incorporating a microprocessor and a tri-axial accelerometer. After investigating on different feature sets and classification algorithms, the final implementation only considers five time domain features and a C4.5 decision tree classifier resulting in an immediate response. This wearable device is successfully integrated into an intelligent environment by Bluetooth Low Energy wireless communication protocol and openHAB as platform-independent integration software. The integration of the system into the home environment allows reactions of the home depending on the activity which enriches the life quality of the residents.

The measured values are transmitted via Bluetooth low energy (LE) and displayed in real time on a smartphone on the outside of the MRI room. During 7 MRI image acquisitions of at least 1 min and a total duration of 25 min no Bluetooth data packets were lost. The raw measurements of the light intensity for the photoplethysmogram based heart rate measurement shows an increased noise floor by 50 LSB (least significant bit) during the MRI operation, whereas the temperature and humidity readings are unaffected. The device itself creates a magnetic resonance (MR) signal loss with a radius of 14 mm around the device surface and shows no significant increase in image noise of an acquired MRI image due to its radio frequency activity. This enables continuous and unobtrusive patient monitoring during MRI scans.

Its understanding may vary from geolocation that uses GPS infrastructure to locate objects on Earth, up to microlocation, which aims at locating users and objects inside closed areas. Although geolocation can be considered as a mature field, there is an ongoing research in the area of microlocation. Despite that, microlocation techniques do not offer satisfactory level of accuracy and implementation flexibility to be practically incorporated into commercial solutions. This is mainly because of high workload that needs to be done in terms of maps preparation and algorithms tuning. In this paper we present a method that can overcome this issue by providing incremental rule learning algorithm for automated discovery of user location on a room-level accuracy. We also show a method of augmenting semantic annotations on physical objects with a use of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons.

The method relies on a key observation that each capacitive touch screen has a unique capacitive signature, which is caused by either the difference in touch sensing technologies or the imperfections of the sensor during its fabrication. In particular, the voltage pattern generated by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) capacitive touchscreens during finger touch sensing is uniquely identifiable. Our preliminary evaluation with actual hardware prototype on 14 mobile touchscreens shows that on-top achieves a promising performance of 100% detection rate without any false positive. We also show that on-top can be used to securely trigger wireless communication while it consumes a very little amount of power (38.18 times lower than triggering using Near Field Communication (NEC) and 18.28 times lower than using Bluetooth low energy (BLE)).

This apparatus is intended to establish the feasibility of harvesting ambient RF energy to power emerging ultra-low-power sensors and microcontrollers. We simultaneously acquire RF measurements from a spatial and polarization diversity antenna system, with both a spectrum analyzer (frequency-selective but slow), and a log amp (wideband but fast), explain key tradeoffs in the measurement configuration, and present a post-processing algorithm which provides a reliable characterization of the RF energy available in the 2.4GHz ISM band. Preliminary results suggest enough energy is available to support a low duty cycle wireless sensor node system. An average RF power of 11nW is observed 10m away from a typical Wi-Fi access point in an office environment, suggesting the possibility of low duty cycle, wirelessly powered sensing and communication using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or another ultra low power uplink.

In indoor environments, however, occupancy detection can be a very challenging task. A solution to this can be provided by the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons installed in the building. In this work we evaluate the performance of a BLE based occupancy detection system geared towards emergency situations that take place inside buildings. The system is composed of BLE beacons installed inside the building, a mobile application installed on occupants' mobile phones and a remote control server. Our approach does not require any processing to take place on the occupants' mobile phones, since the occupancy detection is based on a classifier installed on the remote server. Our real-world experiments indicated that the system can provide high classification accuracy for different numbers of installed beacons and occupant movement patterns.

System/circuit techniques enable signal path duty cycles as low as sub-1% and result in a 35 mu A Photo Plethysmography (PPG) RX Chain - 5X lower than published state of the art - while maintaining overall SNR > 80dBFS. The signal chain is adaptively synchronized by an ultra-low power FSM and includes a 1.3 mu W 14b 1kSPS SAR A/D. Input signal-aware, real-time data path adaptation is achieved by leveraging on-the-fly algorithms running on an external microcontroller (mu C) to further reduce system energy. A programmable, asynchronous capacitive reset amplifier (PARCA) with NEF of 4.8 and dx/dt analog feature extractor demonstrate energy efficient ECG capture. A battery-powered, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based, wearable platform with simultaneous ECG and PPG acquisition using this AFE has been demonstrated.

However, existing BLE mesh implementations cannot simultaneously achieve low-power operation, symmetrical communication, and scalability. A major limitation of mesh networks is the inability of the BLE stack to handle network-scalable time synchronization. Pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs) have been studied extensively and are able to achieve fast and reliable synchronization across a range of applications and network topologies. This paper presents a lightweight physical (PHY) layer accelerator to the BLE stack that enables scalable synchronization command with a PCO. The accelerator is a fully digital solution that can be synthesized with only the standard cells available in any silicon technology. This paper provides a detailed analysis of PCO-based BLE mesh networks and explores per-node system-level requirements. Finally, the analytical results are validated with measurements of a custom radio node based on the ubiquitous AD9364 transceiver.

The experiment was performed on a live porcine model in full accordance with ethical standards. Measurement data from two different sensors were collected and sent through a fat-IBC network. The fat-IBC network consisted of three nodes, of which two used antennas implanted in the fat tissue of a live porcine model and one used an on-body antenna placed on the skin. The sensor data was forwarded via Bluetooth Low Energy to an Intel Health Application Platform device, which in turn forwarded the encrypted data to a web server. The experimental results demonstrate that the fat channel can be used in an end-to-end communication scheme, which could involve relaying of sensor data from an implanted device to an external web server.

This research proposes an indoor navigation system oriented to visually impaired users, integrating the OGC IndoorGML and CityGML standards with Bluetooth Low Energy devices (BLE) by using the RSSI signal loss value and the Weighted Path Loss - techniques to calculate the user's location. This paper describes the design of the system and its implementation as a functional prototype in a mobile web application. Several operational tests were conducted to determine both the accuracy and precision of the user location. The user's positioning results show a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.88 m in a scenario with obstacles and no height difference of the BLE devices location, and a RMSE of 1.06 m in a scenario with obstacles and height difference. These results confirm the potential of the implemented prototype to grow into a fully operational system.	[Montilla, Y.

Smart cities' main priority is citizens and environmental sustainability. In practice, wireless sensors networks over mesh networks are the approach employed most of the time. In terms of wireless communications technologies, Bluetooth low energy offers a robust, low cost, and low power consumption option. The recently published Bluetooth mesh profile specification addresses the most relevant challenges on that paradigm, adding secure multicast communications capabilities. A framework to create Smart Cities services was proposed and a traffic light service was used to demonstrate specification applicability for smart cities' services. The proposed service showed that data may be collected and shared between devices in a mesh network through and over a metropolitan area.

Moreover, these approaches often rely on cloud-offloading for data processing which requires extra communication latency and energy. To overcome these challenges, we develop an RF-based DfOD system using easily-deployable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Our system uses a kilobyte-sized machine learning algorithm running on the BLE device to predict the occupancy of a room from a small number of wireless packets, thereby enabling energy-frugal real-time analytics. We validate our approach with experiments in two indoor rooms using four nRF52840 BLE radios. Initial results suggest our system can detect occupancy of an indoor environment with 95% accuracy, 96% precision, and 92% recall while drawing a meager amount of current.

Success of these systems depends on two very important factors: power efficiency of the sensor nodes and communication reliability. In this paper, we investigate the effect of using unidirectional (broadcasting) communication on the power consumption and reliability of a wireless sensor node. A high-precision wireless temperature sensor reported in an earlier publication is employed as a case study. First, we calculate the energy required to transmit and receive a message using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) in the physical layer without taking any reliability precautions. Then, we estimate the amount of energy required for the reliable transmission of a BLE packet using the BLE acknowledgment method and forward error correction (FEC) in the application layer. Through this paper, we show that the power consumption of a wireless temperature sensor can be reduced using broadcast communication and simultaneous forward error correction while providing enough reliability in short ranges.

A type of wireless device that has become very popular in the past years has been the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon. This compact, battery-powered device can enable location-based and proximity services across indoor spaces. Several indoor positioning techniques have been explored to achieve indoor localization using these wireless devices. One of these techniques is the fingerprinting technique, which requires careful collection of training data at known locations. We developed an app to facilitate and expedite the process of collecting training data with iOS devices. The training data is collected by our app and saved in the cloud for future retrieval. We collected training data from different floor maps, performed initial analysis on this data, and tested a fingerprinting algorithm in order to provide indoor localization. We developed several tools to evaluate and visualize the training data and tested our indoor localization algorithm in a real-time scenario.

Ranging algorithms for positioning rely on the accuracy of the parameters of the propagation model. This model is used to infer an estimate of the distance of a mobile device from each access point from the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). In this work we present an algorithm which dynamically recalculates and improves the propagation model. The improvement of the model parameters fits the environment's characteristics and, more importantly, the reception characteristics of the device used. The proposed algorithm is tested with different devices at an indoor deployment covering a large area where Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is used. The experimental results show that the proposed method offers a significant accuracy improvement to some devices while it slightly improves the performance of those that are more properly tuned.

Indoor RF power can be harvested from Wi-Fi devices in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Indoor photovoltaic power, while often too low to be considered useful, can be used as biasing current to improve the efficiency of the RF harvester. The proposed harvester performs impedance matching in two bands and maximum power point tracking and stores energy in a solid-state battery and a supercapcitor. Our implementation of the energy-neutral BLE beacon can broadcast every 45 seconds at the input power of 15 dBm. In terms of harvested power, our proposed system harvests more power from both bands in a miniature, low-cost circuit than the state-of-the-art from three channels in a single band. This work represents a step towards enabling a class of IoT systems to operate entirely on harvested indoor RF power.

Real-Time-Location-Systems (RTLS) is a key tool for achieving this goal. They enable intelligent and automated production processes. Existing solutions such as Ultra-Wideband, Bluetooth-Low-Energy, or Radio-Frequency-Identification have drawbacks in costs, range, or accuracy. 5G is a newly developing standard, recently including high-accuracy positioning. It is unclear, however, if 5G positioning has reached industrial maturity. This contribution aims to determine the state-of-the-art of 5G positioning by performing a systematic literature review and comparing its findings to industrial positioning requirements. 143 articles were analyzed and categorized as: the fundamentals of radio-frequency positioning, an overview of existing solutions, the state-of-the-art, and the maturity of 5G as an industrial positioning system. Results show that, theoretically, centimeter-level accuracies are pursued. However, practical tests are rarely conducted. Concluding, 5G positioning shows great potential, but industrial pilots are required to validate the theoretical characteristics.

Many actions have been undertaken to slow down its expansion and, among the others, contact tracing applications are the less invasive to monitor the spread of the virus. The idea behind contact tracing is to track contacts between people by the exchange of identifiers, not linked to individuals, exploiting the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to estimate the duration and proximity of contacts. The data collected in this way is used for the sole purpose of notifying a potential contact with an infected person without revealing their identity and location. This paper presents a contact tracing protocol based on blockchain technology that exploits smart contracts for reporting contacts at risk of contagion. The novelty of the proposed solution is the use of Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) to guarantee user privacy through a decentralized approach, equipped with a reliable non-proprietary notification mechanism that allows public access to anonymous infections data.

Different works have addressed the effect of the configuration parameters, mainly the transmission power (Tx) and period (Ts), over positioning accuracy but not on the system lifespan and the trade-off between these two. In this work, different configurations of one, three and six slots have been tested over the same experimental setup. Positioning accuracy was obtained using different variations of the Weighted k-Nearest Neighbours (Wk-NN) algorithm, and the system lifespan was estimated using the actual current consumption and transmission mechanism for each configuration. Experimental results have shown that Tx and the number of slots can be adjusted to optimize this trade-off; meanwhile, changes in Ts worsen Wk-NN results more than in the other parameters, showing that the minimum Ts is always the best option.

The system combines the advantages of the detecting method of electromagnetic signals and the indoor positioning technology based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE). By analyzing the magnetic field model, common inductance coils are used as a sensor to detect the magnetic field, and the differential steering mechanism of the motor is controlled by the tracking characteristics of the dual- inductive electromagnetic sensor. For GPS can not provide satisfactory indoor positioning results, on the basis of the electromagnetic tracking system combined with the indoor positioning technology based on spatial information mode, a stable and independent indoor positioning system is finally realized. And with the predetermined electromagnetic track crossing point, the dead reckoning accumulated error for signpost is revised. The experimental results show that the system can achieve stable operation, and the system design is reasonable and basically meets the design goals and users' needs.

Proximity-hazardous situations involving the ground worker and construction equipment often occur in roadway work zones because of their complex and dynamic interactions in proximity. To detect potential hazardous situations, many researchers have explored various sensing technologies and approaches to address this challenge. Most of their research has focused on identifying the capability of developed/used systems in certain settings. Recent studies found that various interactions (e.g., equipment with various speeds) could cause an alert delay of certain proximity sensing and alert systems. Despite this, limited research efforts have been made to explore this problem using sensing technologies. To handle the issue with the potential delay, which can lead to injuries or fatalities, this study introduces adaptive signal processing using bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors. The adaptive signal-processing approach demonstrates that the responsiveness of the BLE-based proximity sensing system concerning delay can be improved.

PPG signals are influenced by the respiration or breathing process and hence can be used for estimation of respiration rate. R-Band detects the PPG signal that is routed to a Bluetooth low energy device such as a nearby-placed smartphone via microprocessor. Further, we developed an algorithm based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) regression for the estimation of respiration rate. We proposed spectral kurtosis features that are fused with the state-of-the-art respiratory-induced amplitude, intensity and frequency variations-based features for the estimation of respiration rate (in units of breaths per minute). In contrast to the neural network (NN), ELM does not require tuning of hidden layer parameter and thus drastically reduces the computational cost as compared to NN trained by the standard backpropagation algorithm. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on Capnobase data available in the public domain.

Establishing cryptographically secure communication links between two transceivers requires the pre-agreement on some key, unknown to an external attacker. In recent years there has been growing attention in techniques that generate a shared random key through observation of the channel and its effects on the exchanged messages. In this work we present SKYGlow, a novel scheme for secret-key generation, designed for IoT devices, such as IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceivers. SKYGlow employs the Discreet Cosine Transform (DCT) of channel observations and Slepian-Wolf coding for information reconciliation. Real-life experiments have resulted in the creation of 128-bit secret keys with only 65 packet exchanges and with an entropy of 0.9978 bits, making our scheme much more energy-efficient compared with others in the existing literature.

One emerging group of these is called wearable devices. The wireless technologies used by wearable devices need to consider the long lasting of battery life. Consequently, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has emerged as the wireless technologies for wearable devices due to its features of low power consumption. In this research we focus on enabling technologies that will facilitate seamless communications between the wearable devices and the oneM2M platform based on BLE. We evaluate three different designs: (1) IPE (Inter-working Proxy Application Entity), (2) RESTful BLE and (3) 6LoWPAN over BLE. Our research compares and evaluates the main features and behaviors of these three designs and investigates key performance indicators of each such as power consumption, system performance, transmission efficiency and design complexity. With our research we are able to determine which specific design is most suitable for wearable devices under different system design requirements.

However, BLE beacon networks suffer from short battery lifetime, which induces additional maintenance costs. In this paper, we propose a novel user existence-aware BLE beacon firmware, USTEA, that extends BLE beacon lifetime by changing its operating configuration. Leveraging scan response and request features of Bluetooth Core Specifications, a mechanism for the detection of nearby user smartphones is proposed. Furthermore, we present an energy consumption model of the proposed firmware, along with an optimization problem for finding the optimal configuration that minimizes the overall energy consumption and overhead induced by switching delay. Last but not least, we introduce a prototype of the USTEA firmware and demonstrate experiments. Through the experiments, we prove that the USTEA firmware can extend a beacon's lifetime up to 250% under low user-existence frequency and high energy demand application conditions.

World Health Organization (WHO) statistic shows that the mortality rate of hypertension is 9.4 million per year and causes 55.3% of total deaths in cardiovascular (CV) patients [2]. Early detection and prevention of hypertension can significantly reduce the CV mortality. We are presenting a wireless chest wearable vital sign monitoring platform. It measures Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethsmogram (PPG) and Ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals and sends data over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to mobile phone-acts as a gateway. A custom android application relays the data to thingspeak server where MATLAB based offline analysis estimates the blood pressure. A server reacts on the health of subject to friends & family on the social media - twitter. The chest provides a natural position for the sensor to capture legitimate signals for hypertension condition. We have done a clinical technical evaluation of prototypes on 11 normotensive subjects, 9 males 2 females.

To this end, we propose a single-anchor architecture and design based on an electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) antenna and Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The proposed algorithm relies on received signal strength (RSS) values measured by the receiver equipped with the ESPAR antenna for every considered antenna radiation pattern. The calibration-free concept is achieved by using inexpensive BLE nodes installed in known positions on the walls of the test room and acting as reference nodes for the positioning algorithm. Measurements performed in the indoor environment show that the proposed approach can successfully provide positioning results better than those previously reported for single-anchor ESPAR antenna localization systems employing the classical fingerprinting method and relying on time-consuming calibration procedures.

First, beacon signals fully cover a targeted area. The second issue is that beacon infrastructure is designed for reliable performance against environmental properties. Finally, the experience quality of notification to smartphone or mobile devices takes high level even though users have mobility such as a driver in a car, a user riding a bicycle, a walking user, etc. For finding out base lines to achieve these features in interactive system design and practical deployment of smart applications based on smartphone-beacon interaction, we evaluate real performances of beacon running at outdoor places. We compare the novel notification model, named n-1 model, which merely copes with application variables with delivering content redundancy, to the typical 1-1 alignment mean of one notification with single content. The proposed model shows average 70 % improvement against those impediments.

The QL antenna is a very thin single-layer groundless structure which allows for the installation of neighboring electronics and sensors which need to be extremely close to the epidermis layer. The performance of the proposed antennas was investigated for three main standards: GSM-900, GSM-1800, and Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Radiation pattern measurements were conducted to compare their results with their simulation counterparts. Moreover, data communication tests showed that the acquired BER readings could qualify the BLE and GSM-900 antennas to work as part of 4-QAM wireless links. Besides these hands-on endeavors, an equivalent and more efficient mathematical model of biological tissues which make up the human arm was computed. The equivalent model was tested in software and has the practical potential to be realized in physical phantom making.

Beacons expose semantic annotations instead of basic identifiers, i.e., machine-understandable descriptions of physical resources. This enables novel ontology-based object advertisement and discovery and - in turn- advanced user-to-thing and autonomous thing-to-thing interactions. The demo shows the evolution from the PW to the PSW in a discovery scenario set in a winery, where bottles are equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and a customer can discover them using her smartphone. The final goal is to prove benefits of PSW over basic PW, including: rich semantic-based object annotation; dynamic annotations exploiting on-board sensors; enhanced discovery and ranking of nearby objects through semantic matchmaking; availability of interactions even without working Internet infrastructure, by means of point-to-point data exchanges.

Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) variant aims at improving power consumption on battery-constrained devices. BLE-enabled devices broadcast information (e.g., as beacons) to nearby devices via advertisements. Unfortunately, such functionality can become a double-edged sword at the hands of attackers. In this paper, we primarily show how an attacker can exploit BLE advertisements to exfiltrate information from BLE-enable devices. In particular, our attack establishes a communication medium between two devices without requiring any prior authentication or pairing. We develop a proof-of-concept attack framework on the Android ecosystem and assess its performance via a thorough set of experiments. Our results indicate that such an exfiltration attack is indeed possible though with a limited data rate. Nevertheless, we also demonstrate potential use cases and enhancements to our attack that can further its severeness. Finally, we discuss possible countermeasures to prevent such an attack.

Variations in routines can be indicative of physical or cognitive decline in elderly adults, which makes it very attractive to support independent living and healthy ageing. Our proposal is based on an indoor symbolic location system based on low-cost and easy-to-install Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter beacons, together with a mobile receiver. The user's symbolic location is estimated from the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) model, which is merged with the acceleration provided by the receiving mobile device. The location is used to estimate the time spent in each monitored room, to infer a time-based routine. The symbolic localization has an accuracy higher than 96%. The subsequent daily monitoring allows for the detection of variations with respect to a defined routine that can serve as an alarm for the user, family members or caregivers.

The introduction of a wireless communication and networking inside the BMS in order to replace the traditional wired bus brings multiple benefits. As it is a critical application, the network has stringent requirements such as high reliability, low energy consumption, and bounded latency. In this paper, we propose a network architecture based on an enhanced version of the IEEE Std 802.15.4 Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) Medium Access Control (MAC) mode running over the physical layer of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). To orchestrate the data transmissions, we present a reliable and predictable schedule based on the Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN) Group Acknowledgement (GACK) method which dynamically manages the retransmissions. We implement a WBMS for the Renault Zoe battery pack to demonstrate that our proposed architecture achieves 100% of network reliability with bounded latency, and low energy consumption.

In this context, Bluetooth Beacons can strongly benefit of Mesh configuration for the deployment of new efficient mobility services in Edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. In this paper, we investigate how to use the Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) concept for improving the indoor and outdoor Navigation Systems using low-cost Bluetooth devices. This scientific work is preparatory for the adoption of Machine Learning algorithms that will drive and optimise the configuration of WMN, directly deployed at the Edge, achieving advances for navigation services. Detailed analysis of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal propagation in both indoor and outdoor scenarios are reported, representing the starting point for forthcoming developments. Specifically, our analysis shows how BLE interference among beacons depends on the distance among beacons and transmitting power, and this open new opportunities in designing new optimization strategies to be executed at the Edge.

Here we report cloud-based wearable and stationary IoT air pollution sensors which can measure an asthma patient's exposure to ozone, NO2 and aldehydes in real-life settings. The wrist-watch shaped sensor can measure formaldehyde levels in air from 30ppb to 10ppm using fuel cell technology, and continuously operate over 7 days without recharging. The smart-speaker sized stationary sensor measures ozone and NO2 from 20ppb to 1000ppb in the air. The wearable sensor can wirelessly upload data to the stationary sensor or an Android smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The stationary sensor or the smartphone functions as a gateway to a cloud-based informatics system which handles sensor data storage, management and analytics. Potential applications of these point-of-care IoT sensors include epidemiological studies of asthma development and exacerbations, personalized asthma management and environmental monitoring.

The antenna was built on a flexible and thin Kapton material inserted between 2 layers of bovine leather, suitable for limited weight and slim ankle bracelet designs. Proposed antenna structure consist of 2 opposed planar inverted F antennas modified using matching stubs, sharing the same substrate and ground plane, with total size of 96.8 x 35 x 4.14 mm. The ground plane area of the antenna can be used for electronic circuit and battery placement. The antenna structure operates in the following specific 4 bands: BeiDou (1561 MHz), GPS (1575 MHz), GLONASS (1602 MHz), and BLE (2400 MHz). The antenna exhibited great agreement between electromagnetic simulations in ADS Momentum and measurements performed into 3D anechoic chamber with anthropomorphic leg-foot model from Speag. The antenna peak gain is approximately -1.8 dBi for GNSS bands and -2.0 dBi for BLE.

However, despite extensive research on indoor localization techniques, they are still not ready for deployment in large and complex environments, like shopping malls and hospitals, where navigation assistance is needed. To achieve accurate, continuous, and real-time localization with smartphones in such environments, we present a series of key techniques enhancing a probabilistic localization algorithm. The algorithm is designed for smartphones and employs inertial sensors on a mobile device and Received Signal Strength (RSS) from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We evaluate the proposed system in a 21,000 m(2) shopping mall which includes three multi-story buildings and a large open underground passageway. Experiments in this space validate the effect of the proposed technologies to improve localization accuracy. Field experiments with visually impaired participants confirm the practical performance of the proposed system in realistic use cases.

This paper has a twofold goal, to propose an IoT architecture linking physical devices with operators to afford efficient communication (green-BY concept) and to provide energy-saving oriented techniques to encourage the deployment of cost-effective networks, which enhances the lifespan of IoT devices (green-IN concept). Namely, we propose a flexible sleep-based algorithm called SustainaBLE, suitable for a wide range of domains using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A real case studio has been carried out to provide power consumption measurements using SustainaBLE proposal, achieving one-year autonomy compared to one-day autonomy with BLE Connection mode. This achievement en courages us to broaden our experimental study considering more nodes, different topologies and additional standards for contributing to the future Industrial IoT networks.

In the case of outdoor positioning, a global positioning system (GPS) is generally used. There is a limit to the method of using the GPS signal for indoor positioning. A typical indoor positioning method is to use a beacon based on bluetooth low energy (BLE). However, this method has disadvantages that needs to be charged, as well as additional hardware is needed. This paper proposes indoor positioning technology using optical camera communication (OCC) which can overcome these disadvantages of existing positioning method.

J	Wu, DK; Zheng, GX				Wu, Dakui; Zheng, Guoxin			Compact Dual-Band Coupler for Vehicular Beam-Forming Array	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION			English	Article							ANTENNA; DESIGN	A novel kind of compact dual-band quadrature patch coupler for vehicular beam-forming array is proposed for the first time in this paper. To keep the performance of the first operating frequency 2.4GHz (for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)) and generate the second operating frequency 5.9GHz (for Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)) simultaneously, complementary triangular split resonant rings (CTSRRs) and splitting gaps are employed to improve the performance of this new coupler; final size of the proposed coupler is 0.24 lambda(g) (for 2.4GHz). To validate the performance and design method of the coupler this paper proposed, a 3D model is constructed and optimized with ANSOFT HFSS firstly and then a coupler prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the amplitude unbalance (AU) is 0.54 dB and 0.44 dB for 2.4GHz and 5.9GHz, respectively, and the corresponding phase unbalance (PU) is 93.5 and 92 degrees, respectively.

We provide results of an investigation of the applicability of 6LoWPAN with RPL mesh networks for home and building automation use cases. The proper selection of Trickle parameters and neighbor reachable time-outs is important in the RPL protocol suite to respond efficiently to any path failure. These parameters were analyzed in the context of energy consumption w.r.t the number of control packets. The measurements were performed in an Automated Physical Testbeds (APTB). The results match the recommendation by RFC 7733 for selecting various parameters of RPL protocol suite. This paper shows the relationship between various RPL parameters and control traffic overhead during network rebuild. Comparative measurement results with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in this work showed that 6Lo with RPL outperformed BLE in this use case with less control traffic overheads.

The BLE-ITS is a promising, inexpensive alternative to the well-known GPS. It can be used in human traffic analysis, such as indoor tourist facilities. Tourists or other customers are tagged by a unique MAC address assigned to a simple and energy-saving BLE beacon emitter. Their location is determined by a distributed and scalable network of popular Raspberry Pi microcomputers equipped with BLE and WiFi/Ethernet modules. Only simple triggered messages in the form of login records (LRs) are sent to a server, where the so-called path vectors (PVs) and interest profile (IPr) are set. The authors implemented the prototype and demonstrated its usefulness in a controlled environment. As it is shown in the paper, the solution is highly overlap-resistant and mitigates the so-called multilocation problem.

Despite several security features, the hardware and software limitations of these devices makes them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Due to the use of these devices in increasingly diverse and safety-critical applications, the capability to detect MITM attacks has become more critical. To address this challenge. we propose the use of the response time behavior of a BLE device observed in relation to select read and write operations and introduce an active MITM attack detection system that identifies changes in response time. Our measurements on several BLE devices show that their response time behavior exhibits very high regularity, making it a very reliable attack indicator that cannot be concealed by an attacker. Test results show that our system can very accurately and quickly detect MITM attacks while requiring a simple learning approach.

In this paper, a robust and low-cost energy-autonomous wireless rotational speed sensor is presented, which harvests energy from the rotary motion of its host using the variable reluctance principle. A mieroeleetromeehanical system (MEMS) gyroscope is utilized for angular velocity measurements, and a Bluetooth Low Energy System-on-Chip (S0C) transmits the acquired samples wirelessly. An analysis on the individual subsystems is performed, investigating the output of the energy transducer, the required energy by the load, and energy losses in the whole system. The results of simulations and experimental measurements on a prototype implementation show that the system achieves energyautonomous operation with sample rates between 1 to 50 Hz already at 10 to 40 rotations per minute. Detailed investigations of the system modules identify the power management having the largest potential for further improvements.

The majority of activity recognition frameworks, however, employ a network of specialised building sensors or a network of body-worn sensors. As this approach suffers with respect to practicality, we propose the use of commercial off-the-shelf devices. In this work, we design and evaluate an activity recognition system composed of a smart watch, which is enhanced with location information coming from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We evaluate the performance of this approach for a variety of activities performed in an indoor laboratory environment, using four supervised machine learning algorithms. Our experimental results indicate that our location-enhanced activity recognition system is able to reach a classification accuracy ranging from 92% to 100%, while without location information classification accuracy it can drop to as low as 50% in some cases, depending on the window size chosen for data segmentation.

Interactive voice interfaces such as the Amazon Echo provide an easy way for individuals to access a variety of data by using voice commands, making interacting with technology easier for those of limited technological experience. Wearable sensors, such as the Angel Sensor, combined with voice interactive devices, such as the Amazon Echo, have allowed for the development of applications that provide easy user interaction.

For example, a group of tourists may be monitored by a tour operator to keep the group together and on schedule. Alternatively, a group of elementary school children in transit to school should be closely supervised by an adult to ensure the children stay safe. This paper presents LASSO, a smartphone-based service that exploits wireless devices carried by each group member to provide infrastructure-free group formation and monitoring. We show how smartphones equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can be used as personal beacons in a device-to-device group monitoring protocol to allow each user to join a group and see a distributed view of group membership in real time. While LASSO is general purpose in nature, we demonstrate it and evaluate its performance through a prototype application used by a tourist guide to monitor tour participants.

Since iBeacon can broadcast beacon signal every certain interval, we can adopt iBeacon instead of RFID for baby tracking. In this paper we developed a new application to obtain the necessary data from iBeacon and then derive the iBeacon path-loss model for line-of-sight (LOS) situation in in-room environment on account of RSS analysis. Besides, we apply the existing path-loss model used in Estimote iBeacons and compare the performance of those two models. Simulation results of Cramer-Rao low bound estimation of location error model are also given in this paper considering 2D and 3D scenarios respectively. After the feasibility analysis we conclude our work with a discussion on the feasibility of using iBeacon for locating and tracking rather than RFID, especially in hospitals.

Sensors deployed on the human body, especially at the limbs often move along different positions. Usually, the transmit power is set to a sufficiently high value to achieve reliable transmission for the constellation with highest attenuation. For periodic movements, data transmission can be carried out at the position of the lowest path loss between the sender and the receiver, provided this position can be reliably identified. We propose a novel framework that predicts this position using acceleration data and the received signal strength. By learning a correlation between these signals, accurate predictions can be performed and up to 24.7% of the power spent by a Bluetooth Low Energy module for the transmission of a packet can be saved while still achieving the same packet error rate as with sending using the higher transmit power.

When applied to mechanical ventilation, it provides essential healthcare to the patient and helps save lives. This survey elaborates on a deep review of related literature about the most robust and effective innovative healthcare solutions using modern technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Blynk, Bluetooth Low Energy, Robotics, and embedded systems. It emphasizes that IoT-based wearable and smart devices that work as integrated systems can be a faster response to other pandemic crises, respiratory diseases, and other problems that may occur in the future. It may also extend the performance of e-Health platforms used as monitoring systems. Therefore, this paper considers the state of the art to substantiate research about sensors, highlighting the relevance of new studies, strategies, approaches, and novelties in the field.

However, inefficient power supplies and difficulties in device assembly have largely limited their applications. Here, we report an integrated gas-sensing system using a single-walled car-bon nanotube film with good flexibility and large surface area to detect a target gas. A single-walled carbon nanotube/silicon heter-ojunction solar cell capable of stably providing a voltage of -0.5 V under the illumination of a standard solar intensity powers the sensor. Our self-powered sensing system shows an ideal rect-angle-shaped nitrogen dioxide detection curve and demonstrates higher sensitivity and faster response time than one driven by external power at room temperature. We attribute this better activity to the increased carrier concentration originating from sin-gle-walled carbon nanotubes in both sensing and powering compo-nents. Finally, wireless communication between the system and a phone is demonstrated with a Bluetooth Low Energy module.

This SCPA is applied to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in 55 nm CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.67 X 0.35 mm(2). In order to reduce the area of the transceiver chip, the SCPA shared the matching network with low noise amplifier (LNA). The SCPA uses an array of small Unity-cell PAs that are recess connected in parallel according to a digital code word. The control signal is generated by thermometer decoder to control output power and output efficiency. The simulation results show that the peak output power is more than 6dBm and the peak drain efficiency is more than 29% at 2.5GHz. The isolation from SCPA to LNA is 17.6dB at 2.5GHz and the total power consumption is 13.2 mW.

Our proposed method is validated in a large-scale, real-world scenario composed of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based devices. We demonstrate, throughout the paper, that the addition of location information of training points to the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) as an attribute for the clustering step improves the positioning accuracy. Moreover, the obtained results show that our solution outperforms the naive Bayesian estimation up to 12% - regarding the positioning accuracy - and the broadly deployed kNN for reduced training dataset size - regarding both accuracy and online processing time. In this sense, KLIP proves to be an efficient and scalable alternative when both site-survey effort and energy consumption constraints must be taken into account.

BMADS: BLE Mesh Asynchronous Dynamic Scanning	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Relays; Energy consumption; Proposals; Standards; Distributed databases; Bluetooth; Mesh networks; Bluetooth mesh; Bluetooth; energy; wireless mesh networks		The Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) mesh profile, currently standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), assumes that friend and relay nodes should be continuously scanning the channel ready to receive any incoming transmissions (TXs). This is very inefficient in terms of energy consumption. Hence, we present BMADS, an asynchronous dynamic scanning mechanism designed to reduce the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. BMADS is implemented as a new feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications without modifying its core. This feature reduces the scanning cycles of the nodes, but still ensuring the reliability. To make this possible, BMADS sends a new control message sequence before transmitting the data. This sequence puts the nodes into continuous scan mode, preparing the network for data TX. The proposal can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain TX delay and require especially low-energy consumption. BMADS allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of the relay nodes up to 98%.	[Perez-Diaz-de-Cerio, D.; Valenzuela, J.

The localization information is obtained by a Bluetooth Low Energy infrastructure installed in the museum and several location-aware services can be provided. In fact, multimedia content can be proposed to a user when he is around the object of his interest. This content can be shared with neighboring users since all the locations are known. Such a strategy allows saving energy and increasing the downloading throughput.

Conventional BLE transmitters have unique RF fingerprints due to variation-induced imperfections in the underlying circuits. Coupled with BLE's wide adoption in mobile devices and tendency to transmit continuously, BLE has become a significant threat to the location privacy of individual users. The primary source of this privacy threat is that BLE transmitters have a unique Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) that can be easily fingerprinted by passive adversaries. To combat this, a test chip is developed that pseudo-randomly changes its CFO by switching in a binary-weighted set of semi-identical MIM capacitors into the tank of an $LC$ voltage controlled oscillator, all while maintaining compatibility with BLE standard specifications. Measurement results reveal that privacy preservation can be improved from only a few seconds with a conventional design, to over a day with the proposed design.

However, energy status monitoring, which is essential for device maintenance, proved to be a major concern as the energy status of energy harvesting devices can change quickly due to charging and discharging behaviours. Existing energy status monitoring methods performed in a crowd-assisted manner or by demanding on-site data collections are accompanied by severe loss of energy status information. This paper presents an accurate energy status recovery framework with SVR to address this issue. The proposed framework leverages recurrent training of SVR with lost energy status information to capture features from discharge behaviour to achieve high accuracy while minimizing the training and prediction time. Multiple real-life BLE beacon energy level records are evaluated to demonstrate that our proposed framework can recover the energy information with at least 90% accuracy under a data loss rate of up to 99%.

These exogenous BCIs typically involve the user staring at a physical stimulus presentation apparatus resulting in prolonged system setup and degraded portability. We present a research platform for BCI implementations in mixed reality (XR) environments, enabling less-invasive holographic stimulus presentation and greatly enhanced portability at low-cost. The platform consists of a 3D-printable electroencephalography (EEG) attachment for the Microsoft HoloLens, firmware for the OpenBCI Cyton EEG amplifier evaluation kit, and Unity software supporting direct Bluetooth low-energy communication between the EEG device and the HoloLens. The platform allows researchers and hobbyists to prototype BCIs with an easy to don/doff EEG attachment for the HoloLens that is capable of recording high-quality EEG using dry electrodes in an untethered XR environment without the need for external compute resources.

Among various alternatives for accurate and cost-effective IPS, positioning based on the Magnetic Field has proven popular, as it does not require specialized infrastructure. Related experimental results have demonstrated good positioning accuracy. However, when transitioned to production deployments, these systems exhibit serious drawbacks to make them practical: a) accuracy fluctuates significantly across smartphone models and configurations and b) costly continuous manual fingerprinting of the area is required. In this paper we propose Copernicus, a self-learning, adaptive system that is shown to exhibit improved accuracy across different smartphone models. Copernicus leverages a minimal deployment of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons to infer the trips of users, learn and eventually build tailored Magnetic Maps for every smartphone model for the specific indoor area. Our experimental results show the positive impact in the positioning, even in case of minimal learning.

MARBLE efficiently stores and broadcasts minimal visual information of 3D objects and help localize a mobile viewer, who receives, renders, and experiences those 3D virtual objects while walking in the environment, wearing an augmented reality headset or viewing it through a smartphone. Compared to other common indoor AR systems, MARBLE consumes less computation resource, stores and broadcasts 3D objects and shapes data over a very long period, does not require a pre-defined texture pattern to be placed in the scene for camera pose estimation, and is less sensitive to camera capture quality. We conduct a user study to demonstrate that MARBLE is capable of capturing freehand gestures, and when replayed back, a user sees a virtual avatar performing the gestures in the 3D environment in real-time.

Tele-monitoring is critical to alleviate this problem and recover from failures quickly. Energy conservation of such a tele-monitoring system is an important consideration. MATEMA6 enables us to monitor and notify the machine status with rapidly and low energy consumption. It is built on top of commodity technologies: a small board computer like Raspberry Pi, a low-power wireless protocol, and mobile phones. Raspberry Pi periodically gathers data from the machines through 6LoWPAN over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The machine errors are notified immediately to the Android application on mobile phones. In addition, the employee can monitor their assigned machines; and the manager can see the overall performance of the factory via the Web browser either on the PC or the mobile phones. We also measure the energy consumption and show that the 6LoWPAN over BLE consumes only 45% and 76% of Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet, respectively.

In order to assist smart factory employees, this paper introduces OperaBLE, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wearable proposal which is aimed at enhancing working conditions and efficiency in Industry 4.0 scenarios. We have developed two innovative algorithms for OperaBLE focused on power awareness as the key-enabling attribute towards success: Low-Frequency Movement Characterisation Algorithm (LoMoCA) and Adaptive Heart Rate Algorithm (AHRA). Novel experiments have been carried out using OperaBLE to determine its operability, reliability, and lifespan. Results obtained during experimentation demonstrate how OperaBLE empowers human-machine collaboration embedding workers in closed-loop performance and ensuring nonharmful working conditions by means of power-aware algorithms. OperaBLE is due to bring digitalisation into smart factories, playing an essential role in the emerging wearable revolution to arise in the following years towards smart production systems.

Micro-localization refers to the phenomena of tracking a target with high accuracy, which is an integral part of location-aware applications, both indoor and outdoor. Although many approaches towards localization have already been proposed in many research works, Received Signal Strength Identification (RSSI) based localization using the latest BLE technology is comparatively a new concept and it reduces the energy requirements of such applications. But RSSI based distance calculation provide only a rough estimation of the proximity and does not give an accurate result for micro-localization. This paper presents and evaluates a computationally simple method for micro-localization of an object from the RSSI values from a collection of iBeacons so the method can be used in devices with very low processing power. Among the different scenarios the experiments were conducted, most of them resulted in localization error of less than 1m.

In this paper, 802.11ah and BLE technologies are evaluated and compared in a home automation scenario. The selected use case includes battery powered sensors, which generate traffic, and mains powered actuators, which consume traffic, connected through a central gateway. The performance is assessed in terms of service ratio, delay and activity factor of the transceivers. Results show that both technologies are suitable for the reference use case scenario. 802.11ah benefits from a higher throughput and lower delay jitter, whereas BLE sensors show lower activity factors and a longer battery lifetime is expected. The analysis is conducted for both fixed and variable traffic load. The performance of BLE results to be more sensitive to an increase of the traffic load with respect to 802.11ah. Eventually, the limitations of the current scenario are illustrated and alternative setups are discussed.

The technique is designed to control power without an impedance converter in the power receiver. Systems using BLE have very slow data feedback of 250 ms. In this case, when the existing control is used, oscillation occurs at the control stage or the control speed becomes slow. Based on the data provided intermittently by the receiver, we propose a technique for controlling power based on machine learning to implement fast control at the transmitter. The data for the proposed model are measured based on the DC voltage and current in the transceiver. The proposed technique is verified using a 6.78MHz magnetic resonance (MR) WPT transceiver. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology is used for communication. The proposed model is trained based on experimental data and controls power with 93.3% accuracy.

It uses transparent behavioral and physiological biometrics like gait, face, voice, and keystrokes dynamics to continuously evaluate the user's identity without explicit interaction. Using signals like location, time of day, and nearby devices to assess the risk of unauthorized access, the required level of confidence in the user's identity is dynamically adjusted. Authentication results are shared securely, end-to-end encrypted using the Signal messaging protocol, with trusted devices to facilitate cross-device authentication for co-located devices, detected using Bluetooth low energy beacons. CORMORANT is able to reduce the authentication overhead by up to 97% compared to conventional knowledge-based authentication whilst increasing security at the same time. We share our perspective on some of the successes and shortcomings we encountered implementing and evaluating CORMORANT to hope to inform others working on similar projects.

This solution forms part of an ambulatory monitoring system for patients with related heart diseases like arrhythmia, hypertension and diabetes, giving a more close interaction between patients and doctors. The hardware is based on the MSP430F5419A microcontroller, the CC2540 Bluetooth Low Energy (both from Texas Instruments), and the SIM908 GSM/GPRS/GPS modem from Simcom. The real time operating system FreeRTOS was used in the firmware. QRS complexes are detected and processed in the ECG wave signal; blood pressure and glucose level are processed as well. A robust communication protocol was implemented and an easy graphical user interface also. A total of 50 different samples were uploaded to the website using developed prototypes in a safety way. This is an interesting solution to have into account in this kind of systems due to its low cost.

The aerial tracking system presented in this paper provides a useful solution for tracking and tracing objects in various scenarios. To ensure reliability and security, the system incorporates appropriate mechanisms, including Lightweight Cryptography, to prioritize confidentiality and integrity. The Android component of the system has two modes of operation: Tracker Mode, running on a smartphone mounted on a drone (RPA), and Client Mode, running on mobile devices on the ground. In Client Mode, users transmit their positioning and trajectory information via Bluetooth Low Energy beacon mode, which is then relayed to the server backend via the 4G/5G network once the RPA enters an area with coverage. The system provides a reliable and secure solution for situations where tracking and tracing are essential, such as the supervision and control of public areas with capacity control or tracking and localizing people in isolated environments.

Our use-case of monitoring cows in remote farms in real-time and perform online state estimation/classification requires intelligent sampling of the underlying HMM. Due to the limited capacity of the sensor network at the dairy farm, and due to possible wireless errors, the central server does not always receive all the sampled data. Right value of the observation arrival rate into the parameter and state estimation algorithm running at a central server is required to ensure that a prescribed heat detection performance level is achieved. We provide a working implementation of a setup where the end devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are provided with an online recommendation on the sampling (hence, channel access) rates so that the HMM state estimated at the central server is (alpha, beta)-current.

While technological advances in Bluetooth Low Energy have allowed for improved wireless control, in particular between personal electronic devices, its use for communication with hearing aids is problematic due to limited battery life. This paper outlines the implementation of acoustic wireless communication between personal electronic devices and hearing aids using On-Off Keying (OOK) and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) between the frequencies of 16 and 20 kHz. Reliable communication with bit error rates less than 10(-3) were achieved for OOK with maximum data signalling rates of 50, 35.7, and 27.8 bits per second (bps) obtained over 1, 2, and 3 metres respectively, while FSK provided maximum data signalling rates of 83.3, 50, and 27.8 bps over the same distances.

However, the initial creation and subsequent maintenance of the signal maps remains a challenge since traditional manual surveying is not scalable. In this work we look at the use of path surveys, which attempt to construct the signal maps from a sparse set of fingerprints collected while a person walks through a space. As such, the survey points rarely provide a uniform coverage of the space of interest. We quantitatively evaluate path surveys with reference to a detailed manual survey using smartphone-grade equipment. We compare both the individual maps (generated using Gaussian Process regression) and their collective positioning performance. Our results are for both WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy signals. We show that a path survey can provide maps of equivalent quality to a manual survey if a series of guidelines we provide are followed.

In the proposed system, a wireless hand gesture recognition glove for real-time translation of sign language commonly used in Taiwan is developed. To discriminate between different hand gestures, we have flex and inertial sensors embedded into the glove so that the three most important parameters, i.e., posture of the fingers, orientation of the palm, and motion of the hand, in Sign Language can be recognized without ambiguity. The finger flexion, palm orientation, and motion trajectory will be sampled periodically. Once the gesture is recognized as a valid signal, it will be encoded and sent to cell phone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for vocabulary look up. Finally, the vocabulary will be translated to speech via Google translator so that people can hear and know the meaning of the sign language. With the proposed system, the deaf-mutes can communicate with others easily.

By replacing manual operations with automatic machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, iVS aims to enhance reliability, save time and costs for patient's monitoring routines carried out in hospitals, clinics and emergency sites. Using advanced wireless communication technologies, it also allows medical staff to access to patient health conditions and other information (e.g., medications, prescriptions, medical treatment history, etc.) from EHR from anywhere at anytime in order to have fast and efficient responses to emergency situations. Network architecture and system design of iVS are first presented. M2M communication protocols to enable inter-operable data exchange between various system entities are explained. Theoretical maximum user data throughput that can be obtained over the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication link connecting patient monitors and smartphones is also calculated.

Based on the latest development, it can be seen that the trend is leading to more electronic supporters in the vehicle. Vulnerable road users like pedestrian and cyclists currently only passively participate in the active communication of the intelligent transportation system. In the current work, we examine to which extend the traffic related communication process can be extended to vulnerable road users outside the vehicular field of vision using mobile devices. First, based on literature research we derive accident-pandering factors creating five typical scenarios that lead to traffic accidents. Second, utilizing those scenarios, we raise functional and nonfunctional requirements for communication systems between road users. Third, we examine the communications technologies of smartphones that could be deployed. Fourth, we describe the implementation of two approaches with different communication technologies (Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi Direct). The evaluation of both implementations completes the current work.

The shape and size of the NdFeB-PDMS composite magnets are highly versatile, while the magnetic and mechanical properties can be tailored within a wide range by the powder concentration. The magnetic field of the composite magnet is sensed by a 3-axial magnetic sensor, and the measured data is wirelessly transmitted using Bluetooth low energy communication standard to a smartphone and dashboard. To withstand corrosive environments and enhance the durability the composite magnets are coated with 2 mu m of Parylene C, while surface passivation of the wireless module is achieved with 5 mu m of Parylene C.

However, privacy concerns regarding handling of sensitive user location data potentially disrupt the adoption of such systems. This paper presents AnonyCast, a novel privacy-aware mechanism for delivering precise location information measured by crowd-tracking systems to individual pedestrians' smartphones. AnonyCast uses sparsely placed Bluetooth Low Energy transmitters to advertise location-dependent, time-varying keys. Using location measurements, AnonyCast estimates a subset of keys that each pedestrian's phone receives along its path. By combining a cryptography scheme called CP-ABE with a novel greedy algorithm for key selection, it encrypts each path before publishing, allowing users to decrypt only their own trajectories. The results from field experiments show that AnonyCast delivers accurate locations over 84% of time, bounding probability of unauthorized access to one's location below 1%.

The typical approach is to modify the end devices to interpret these signals and to function accordingly [2-5]. But our system proposes an Interpreter System within which these signals are decoded and interfaced with the existing devices. The advantage is that the end devices need not be changed to suit the user, because the logic required for interpretation is within the Interpreter System. Therefore it acts as an interface through which the user can control multiple devices at the same time. Acquisition systems can capture and process EOG, EMG and EEG signals and transmit them to the Interpreter System via the Bluetooth Low Energy module. A communication language using EOG works in combination with EEG and EMG to enable communication. This language will help the users to interface with multiple devices with a limited number of symbols.	[Ramesh, Maneesha V.; Nair, Aswathy Asok; Menon, K. A.

J	Zhang, QY; Chen, GL; Chang, CY; Chen, CC				Zhang, Qiaoyun; Chen, Guilin; Chang, Chih-Yung; Chen, Cheng-Chang			MATR: A Mobility-Aware Topology Restructuring Scheme for Bluetooth Body Area Networks	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Mobility; Transmission delay; Wearable; BANs	LOW-ENERGY; TECHNOLOGY; SCATTERNET; CAPACITY	Bluetooth low energy technology has gradually penetrated into people's daily life. Nowadays, a number of wearable devices which are embedded with tiny sensors and Bluetooth radio can create a Bluetooth body area networks (BANs). Because of human mobility, the signal strength of Bluetooth links might be decreased with the link distance, increasing the transmission delay and hence dropping the network throughputs. Considering the mobility issue, this paper presents a mobility-aware topology restructuring scheme, called MATR, for Bluetooth body area networks. The proposed MATR mechanism changes the piconet topology for redirecting the traffic flow to the links with better quality. In addition, the proposed mechanism is also extended to restructure the topology of a scatternet, further reducing the transmission delay of link connecting different Piconets. Performance study reveals that the proposed MATR approaches further reduce the transmission delay and the energy consumption for Bluetooth BANs, decrease the network overheads raised by packet retransmissions, and improve the network throughput of Bluetooth radio area networks.

J	Ma, JH; Cha, SH				Ma, Jae Hoon; Cha, Seung Hyun			A human data-driven interaction estimation using IoT sensors for workplace design	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Data-driven design; Interaction estimation; Human behavior; IoT sensor; Workplace design	TURN-TAKING; PERCEIVED PRODUCTIVITY; SOCIAL INTERACTIONS; FLEXIBLE OFFICE; WORK; SATISFACTION; COMMUNICATION; PRIVACY; ENVIRONMENT; RELOCATION	Accurate face-to-face interaction estimation is required for a successful data-driven design in workplaces. In previous studies, various sensor-based interaction estimation methods which use proximity and speaking data have been developed. However, these data alone cannot confirm the presence of interactions because non-interacting users also engage in speaking activities. This study aims to develop a novel turn-taking pattern-based interaction estimation (i.e., TIE) framework that integrates turn-taking with location data. The framework estimates interactions in three steps: 1) co-location estimation using a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon; 2) speaking-turn ascertainment through volume-based speaker identification; and 3) interaction group recognition based on turn-taking pattern analysis. Using three different experimental scenarios, the interaction estimation accuracy of the framework was demonstrated to be 77.7%. In the absence of co-location estimation errors, the interaction estimation accuracy increases to 95.5%. The demonstration results indicate that the TIE framework has potential for accurate interaction estimation in workplaces.

J	Fronckova, K; Prazak, P				Fronckova, Katerina; Prazak, Pavel			Possibilities of Using Kalman Filters in Indoor Localization	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Kalman filters; indoor localization; location-based services; stochastic estimation	SENSORS	Kalman filters are a set of algorithms based on the idea of a filter described by Rudolf Emil Kalman in 1960. Kalman filters are used in various application domains, including localization, object tracking, and navigation. The text provides an overview and discussion of the possibilities of using Kalman filters in indoor localization. The problems of static localization and localization of dynamically moving objects are investigated, and corresponding stochastic models are created. Three algorithms for static localization and one algorithm for dynamic localization are described and demonstrated. All algorithms are implemented in the MATLAB software, and then their performance is tested on Bluetooth Low Energy data from a real indoor environment. The results show that by using Kalman filters, the mean localization error of two meters can be achieved, which is one meter less than in the case of using the standard fingerprinting technique. In general, the presented principles of Kalman filters are applicable in connection with various technologies and data of various nature.

To this end, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons are one of the preferred candidates because of the widespread use of Bluetooth-enabled devices. However, traditional battery-powered BLE beacons suffer from a limited operation lifetime, inducing additional maintenance operations and costs. This paper addresses this issue by proposing design principles for an ambient light energy harvesting BLE beacon capable of perpetual operation in the indoor environment. The contributions made in this paper include: 1) investigation and modeling of related hardware components, namely the BLE beacon, photovoltaic panel, and capacitor; 2) design principles for selecting hardware components subject to varying environmental conditions and application requirements; and 3) prototyping and field-tests to prove its practicality. Through multiple experiments, this paper proves that the design can operate perpetually under 40 lux light intensity, and can last over 17 h once fully charged.

WINeRS-8 includes a 32-ch recording analog front end, a 4-ch current-controlled stimulator, and a 434 MHz ON-OFF keying data link to an external software-defined radio wideband receiver (Rx). The headstage also has a bluetooth low energy link for controlling the SoC. WINeRS-8/EnerCage-HC2 systems form a bidirectional wireless and battery-less neural interface within a standard homecage, which can support longitudinal experiments in an enriched environment. Both systems were verified in vivo on rat animal model, and the recorded signals were compared with hardwired and battery-powered recording results. Realtime stimulation and recording verified the system's potential for bidirectional neural interfacing within the homecage, while continuously delivering 35 mW to the hybrid WINeRS-8 headstage over an unlimited period.

The system consists of low-power nodes and a set of dedicated beacons. Each tracking node broadcasts pseudonyms and encrypted versions of observed beacon identifiers over a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN). Unlike most commercial systems, our solution ensures that the device owners are the only ones who can locate their devices. We present a detailed design and validate the result with a prototype implementation that considers power and energy consumption as well as side-channel attacks. Our implementation uses Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) technology for secure key-storage in an innovative way. We build and evaluate a complete demonstrator with off-the-shelf IoT nodes, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, and LoRa long distance communication (LPWAN). We validate the setup for a bicycle tracking application and also estimate the requirements for a low-cost ASIC node.

Our idea has extended common participatory sensing systems to realize more practical sensing systems because common participatory sensing mechanisms require a participants' operation to measure some values. Our proposed system consists of a BLE devices on a bus, smartphone applications on a participants' smartphone, and a cloud service. The BLE device has a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver and a communication function based on the BLE specification. The BLE device also activates a neighbor smartphone application by transmitting a special beacon message. Hence, the smartphone application can work and obtain the bus location from BLE device even if it was a suspended status.

Unlike wayside equipment, the new system is an onboard wireless solution utilizing accelerometer and temperature sensors to assess the bearing condition continuously. The harvesting system consists of two thermoelectric generator modules with aluminium heat sinks, a switching boost converter, a battery management circuit, and a lithium rechargeable battery. The performance of the harvester is validated on an AAR class bearing mounted on a laboratory tester, with load and speed simulating common freight routes of up to 896 miles. The energy harvested varies with operating conditions, and data is presented showing the effect of load and speed. Over a realistic route, the net energy harvested is more than double that needed to indefinitely power a Bluetooth Low Energy sensor. The critical design parameters are the ratio of open-circuit voltage to the temperature difference for the thermoelectric module, and the cold start voltage of the boost converter.

It has been proven that maintaining social distance and isolating affected people are highly beneficial for curbing the spread of COVID-19, which all depend on identifying people's trajectories. However, the current interview-based approach is costly, and the existing mobile app-based schemes rely on complete and accurate data. In this paper, we propose a transformer encoder-based approach with spatial position embedding extracted using a graph Combinatorial Laplacian matrix to interpolate incomplete human trajectories. To model human trajectory, we propose a graphical embedded module to extract spatial features based on predefined location clusters. The incomplete trajectory sequences are first preprocessed into matrices and then used to train a deep transformer encoder network for trajectory completion. Our experiments using a real world Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) dataset validate the efficacy of our proposed approach, which outperforms several baseline methods.

This approach is available in wearable devices, is easy to implement and has energy consumption advantages. However, the relative distance calculation is inaccurate, as the strength of BLE signals significantly fluctuates in indoor environments. Typical coping mechanisms, such as path-loss propagation models, require mathematical modeling and time-consuming calibration, that depend on the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel distance estimator based on RSSI-fuzzy classification of the BLE signals. Fuzzy-logic improves the robustness and accuracy of RSSI-based estimators, does not require an explicit propagation model and is easy and intuitive to (graphically) tune (using basic statistical analysis). The estimator's suitability and the feasibility to provide an easy implementation were experimentally demonstrated in two scenarios with real-world data.

Radio frequency (RF) signals are suitable for being used for positioning because of their ubiquity and imperceptibility. This paper utilizes the information from the baseband of a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transceiver for angle estimation and signal strength for distance estimation. The scheme constitutes a single-anchor based solution to calculate the position of a client. It significantly reduces the cost of installation by avoiding traditional methods like multilateration or triangulation that require three or more anchors, even in a small space. To improve the performance, we design a fusion algorithm based on a Kalman filter to integrate measurements of the anchor station and simplified pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) results from the client. Experiments show that the proposed solution estimates positions in high precision without initial user location or heading information. The mean error of the implementation is less than 1 m and can be improved to less than 0.5 m with a precise ranging measurement.

However, replacing these batteries at scale is a non-trivial, labor-intensive task. Energy harvesting has emerged as a potential solution to avoid battery replacement but requires compromises such as application specific sensor node design, simplified communication protocol or reduced quality of service. We show the design of a battery-free sensor node using commercial off the shelf components, and present Pible: a Perpetual Indoor BLE sensor node that uses an ambient light energy harvesting system and can support numerous smart building applications. We show trade-offs between node-lifetime, quality of service and light availability and present a predictive algorithm that adapts to changing lighting conditions to maximize node lifetime and application quality of service.

The global positioning system (GPS) is currently one of the most widely used positioning tools. However, the distance calculation and positioning of GPSs are negatively influenced by the closed structures of indoor environments and tall buildings. Although GPS is fully developed for outdoor environments and provides numerous Internet of Things services, it cannot be applied to indoor positioning involving various obstructions. Bluetooth low energy sensors have been applied to use the accepted received signal strength indication (RSSI) values to conduct indoor positioning. Consequently, sensor placement affect the quality of indoor positioning. In this study, a feature selection difference matching method was proposed. This method not only achieves rapid and accurate positioning. This method also has an advantage in reducing about 49% - 71% of the average excessive amount of data required by various mobile devices to establish prediction models and compare matching results.

With the outbreak of COVID, the technology was widely used for local tracking of the virus spread [1]. However, despite broad interest in using BLE as a tracker, the primary method is based on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) measurements. On the other hand, the previous studies have demonstrated that this method is prone to multi-path and is inaccurate. With the introduction of BLE Direction Finding a shift in localization method has occurred. With the introduction of BEL direction finding, indoor tracking has come closer to its ultimate goal of asset tracking and positioning in crowded indoor environments. In this paper we present a new fast switching antenna array specifically designed for BLE direction finding. Using our newly designed antenna array and switch, we reached to accuracy of approximately 5 degrees degrees.

J	Herrero, R				Herrero, Rolando			Supervised classification for dynamic CoAP mode selection in real time wireless IoT networks	TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						6CoAP; IEEE 802; 15; 4; LoWPAN; Supervised learning; MLE		The Internet Engineering Task Force recommends the use of a group of well-defined protocols to support Internet of ThingsLow-Power Low-Rate Networks (LLNs). These mechanisms range from physical and media access layer technologies like IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy to session and application layer protocols like the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Specifically, CoAP provides, by means of two different modes of operation, great flexibility to deal with the power requirements of wireless LLNs. One mode supports fire-and-forget packet transmission while the other, through retransmissions, guarantees delivery. The trade-off between these mechanisms is the exchange of high packet loss by high latency and increased power consumption. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that dynamically predicts these parameters, by means of supervised learning, based on network conditions that result from Maximum Likelihood Estimation. This prediction, in turns, can be used for on-the-fly CoAP mode selection that accomplishes quality goals.

In this work, we demonstrate a nature-inspired integration and packaging technology that achieves self-powered multi-functional systems with optimized performance and small footprint area. The integration technique is based on bifacial usage of the substrate where devices on both sides are interconnected via through-substrate-vias. Multiple substrates are then integrated and folded into a 3D architecture using side-interlocks following a puzzle-like fashion. On the outer sides of the 3D architecture, sensors, RF devices and energy harvesters are integrated while on the inner faces, a solid-state battery in addition to power-management and data-management circuitry are embedded. To package the system, a polymeric encapsulant is used to protect the inner circuitry and enhance the mechanical resilience of the system. Finally, the system is used to send the collected data wirelessly to a phone using an embedded Bluetooth Low Energy unit.

The hardware components of the mobile devices are renewed almost every six months. however the smartphones still cannot stay awake for more than one day. This is one of the biggest problem today both in the mobile industry and among users as well. The engineers try to reduce the energy usage not just through hardware optimization but also software solutions are made. These solutions are mostly unsuitable for everyday usage, but what happens if we optimize the energy consumption based on the most frequent user habits? The users usually use their devices to be continuously notified about the latest messages, activities, phone calls etc. This behavior can be sometimes unnecessary, for example during the night it is not important to synchronize all e-mails of the users. From that point of view, the users and their devices can form a socio-cognitive channel, which can help to create behavior-based technologies. In this paper we introduce a model which represents the most common smartphone usage scenarios using Markov chains. Based on this model we make suggestions how the processes can be modified to improve the energy consumption of the mobile devices.

J	Herrero, R				Herrero, Rolando			Mechanism for IPv6 adaptation in LoRa topologies	INTERNET OF THINGS			English	Article						6LoWPAN; LoRa; IPv6; LPWAN; CoAP		One of the main requirements of an IoT solution is the support of end-to-end IPv6 connectivity. Most Wireless Personal Area (WPAN) physical and link layers like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ITU-T G.9959 and IEEE 802.15.4 support adaptation mechanisms that, based on the IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) protocol, enable IPv6. On the other hand, Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies like LoRa and SigFox are not typically designed to support access-side IPv6 and rely on gateways for translation and overall cloud connectivity. Lack of end-to-end IPv6 connectivity implies that many of these LPWAN technologies do not fully comply with the IoT paradigm preventing the direct interaction between devices of different physical technologies. In this paper we present an adaptation mechanism that enables end-to-end IPv6 support in an LPWAN scenario that relies on a LoRa physical layer. The scheme is analyzed, modeled and implemented by means of an experimental framework that serves to examine the efficiency of the proposed solution.

However, most works suffer severe performance variations owing to the unreliable received signal strength (RSS). In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to occupancy detection: 1) an unsupervised denoising-contractive autoencoder (DCAE) is built to learn a robust fingerprint representation from the raw RSS measurements, and 2) a supervised softmax function is added at the last layer for classification. A real testbed with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons was built such that we can collect real-world RSS data for experiments. The data were collected via different devices at different times to better reflect environmental variations. The experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves a substantial performance gain in comparison to the conventional machine learning approaches. Specifically, our proposed DCAE is able to reconstruct the noisy and always changing data with less than 0.047 mean square error. Overall, our occupancy detection combining DCAE and softmax classifier achieves sub-room level accuracy for at least 99.3% of the time.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), due to the low energy consumption and generic service stack, has become one of the most popular wireless communication technologies for IoT. However, because of the short communication range and exclusive connection pattern, a BLE-equipped device can only be used by a single user near the device. To fully explore the benefits of BLE and make BLE-equipped devices truly accessible over the Internet as IoT devices, in this paper, we propose a cloud-based software framework that can enable multiple users to interact with various BLE IoT devices over the Internet. This framework includes an agent program, a suite of services hosting in cloud, and a set of RESTful APIs exposed to Internet users. Given the availability of this framework, the access to BLE devices can be extended from local to the Internet scale without any software or hardware changes to BLE devices, and more importantly, shared usage of remote BLE devices over the Internet is also made available.

The work focuses on how mesh networks can be established using Bluetooth Low Energy exploiting the heterogeneous characteristics of the devices in the network. A novel algorithm called Topology Formation considering Role Suitability (TFRS) is proposed aiming to maximize the network lifetime. The algorithm employs a newly introduced metric called role suitability metric (RSM) to assign the best role among master, relay and slave to a participating device. The RSM metric is computed from device characteristics including, but not limited to, energy, mobility and computational capability. We use system-level simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against a reference under a homogeneous deployment scenario consisting of heterogeneous devices. Results show that the network lifetime can be improved significantly when the topology is formed considering the device characteristics for both master role selection and relay selection. TFRS can achieve 20% to 40% higher network lifetime depending on the deployment characteristics over the reference algorithm.

Besides the well-known hearing aid, devices for detection of sound events that occur at home or at work (e.g. doorbell, telephone) are available. Despite the technological progress in the last years and resulting new possibilities, the basic functions and concepts of such devices have not changed. The user still needs special assistive technology that is bound to the home or work environment. In this contribution a new concept for awareness of events in buildings is presented. In contrast to state-of-the-art assistive devices, it makes use of modern Information and Communication and home automation technology, and thus offers the prospect of cheap implementation and higher comfort for the user. In this concept events are indicated by notifications that are send over a Bluetooth Low Energy mesh network from a source to the user. The notifications are received by the user's smartwatch and the event is indicated by vibration and an icon representing its source.

However, BLE beacon networks suffer from short battery lifetime, inducing additional maintenance costs. Previous works have tackled this problem by proposing a more energy-efficient BLE beacon firmware that will change its operating configuration based on user existence information. However, previous efforts could not adapt to varying user traffic conditions and therefore was impractical. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel neural network-driven framework, User-P, that extends beacon lifetime by changing its operating configuration by predicting user traffic conditions. Furthermore, the paper also presents a novel machine learning method tailored for user traffic prediction. Last but not least, the effectiveness of the proposed framework and methods are proven through a set of simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can extend the beacon lifetime by 180% in comparison to that of the state-of-the-art techniques.

Ingestible capsule technology is increasing prevalence in autonomously accessing regions of GI that otherwise require clinical intervention. Our platform is operated using a 3.3-V power source with sensors, possessing a 0.3-220-pF dynamic range with a sensitivity of 3.2 x 10(-3) pF/mV that relay the change in capacitance to a smart system-in-package, which is then transmitted via Bluetooth low energy to an external Android phone. The system is tested with a variety of polymers, which are used in the pharmaceutical industry, to control dissolution at different GI regions characteristic of a specific pH profile. This real-time, cost-effective, and user-friendly platform will ultimately be used to test alternative coating materials that respond to specific biomarkers present in GI secretions, offering significant potential for enhancing gut diagnostics.

One of the common drawbacks of FP is the large data size and consequently the large search space and computational load as a result of either vastness of the positioning area or the finer resolution in the FP grid map. This complexity can be limited reducing the RSSI quantization till to a simple binary indicator at the expense of an increased number of reference points or beacons. This approach turns out to be advantageous for the deployment of FP systems based on diffused beacons equipped with inexpensive technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or other technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT). An appropriate quantization and design of RSSI signatures will make possible the deployment of FP in larger areas maintaining the same computational load and/or the desired localization performance. The experimental results confirm promising computational savings without a relevant impact on the localization performance.

This poses a challenge for RF and antenna design required for wireless operation. In this work, the radio interface design for a 2.4 GHz wireless sensor including a discrete filter balun circuit and an antenna operating at 0.3 mm distance from the body is presented. Thin, lightweight single-layer structure is realized using printed electronics manufacturing technology. The RF and antenna designs are validated by measurements, and a sensor with a fully functional radio interface is implemented and verified. At 0.3 mm from the body, 2.4 dB insertion loss and - 10 dBi realized gain at 2.4 GHz were achieved for a discrete filter balun and antenna, respectively.

In this paper, we propose an indoor positioning and navigation system that guides a user from point A to point B indoors with high accuracy while augmenting their situational awareness. This system has three major components: location recognition (a hybrid indoor localization app that uses Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and Google Tango to provide high accuracy), object recognition (a body-mounted camera to provide the user momentary situational awareness of objects and people), and semantic recognition (map-based annotations to alert the user of static environmental characteristics). This system also features personalized interfaces built upon the unique experiences that both BVI and ASD individuals have in indoor wayfinding and tailors its multimodal feedback to their needs. Here, the technical approach and implementation of this system are discussed, and the results of human subject tests with both BVI and ASD individuals are presented. In addition, we discuss and show the system's user-centric interface and present points for future work and expansion.

The Japanese government aims to have the system adopted by all households by 2030. The system is connected to home appliances via a network, monitors the state of power consumption, and controls power consumption remotely or automatically. However, it cannot manage how much power each user has consumed. This paper proposes a system that can manage power consumption of individual users at a shared house. Specifically, each resident carries a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tag all the time. Using this tag, the system identifies the person who has used home appliances per outlet, and thereby manages the power consumed by each individual. To conduct experiments, we have created a personal outlet by associating a commercially available outlet with a smartphone. We have conducted experiments for a shared house with three residents, and evaluated the system's utility and level of accuracy in identifying individual users.

Five previously introduced attitude estimation algorithms were chosen and implemented in Windows IoT environment. A Texas Instrument CC2650STK wireless sensor was utilized to capture the raw magnetic/inertial data. The raw data was streamed to a DragonBoard 410c single board computer in real-time via Bluetooth low energy with the low sampling frequency. The sensor attitude was estimated using the attitude estimation algorithms continuously. A Shimmer 3 AHRS system was used as a golden standard, and the orientation of the Shimmer 3 was acquired using the Shimmer Consensys PRO 1.5 software. The experimental test showed poor agreement between the estimated and reference orientations and that the calculated orientation was dependent on an initial calibration. Based on the preliminary results and the current limitations in the wearable motion trackers, we may conclude that a precise estimation of a rigid body angle may not be achieved using wearable motion trackers in daily activities and other clinical applications.

The ASIC estimates the Muscle Fibre Conduction Velocity (MFCV) of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals, which provides a metric for quantifying the muscle fatigue state. Analysing the rate of muscle fatigue can be used in muscle rehabilitation, ergonomics and sports science. The system inside the wearable contains a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) System on Chip that calibrates the ASIC and relays the fatigue information to an Android application. The wearable and Android application together form the Muscle Fatigue Monitor. This miniature system offers the same level of muscle fatigue monitoring compared to traditional bulky EMG monitoring systems, whilst extending users' degree of freedom, range and comfort. The wearable consumes 11.21mA of current while BLE is active and 4.71mA of current when inactive. Powered by a 3.7V Lithium-Polymer battery with a capacity of 300mAh, the wearable has a battery life of up to 64 hours.

Precise phase locking of the BAW digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to the low-frequency temperature compensated oscillator is demonstrated. Additional cancellation within the ADPLL of the deterministic jitter induced by the bi-frequency mode on the 32 kHz clock is proven, with a residual modulation on the DCO command word corresponding to +/- 0.5 ppm relative frequency deviation. The RF resulting after frequency up-conversion of the system IF signal with the DCO shows an excellent phase noise of -136.6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency, for a total synthesizer current consumption of 7.52 mA under 1.6 V supply. In addition, 1 Mb/s GFSK Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy modulations have been successfully validated in transmission.

However, due to the limited capacity of a battery, their functionalities are restricted, and the devices may not achieve their intended potential fully. The most promising way to solve this limited capacity problem is wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. In this study, a WPT based implantable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device that continuously records ECG data has been proposed, and its effectiveness is verified through an animal experiment using a rat model. Our proposed device is designed to be of size 24 x 27 x 8 mm, and it is small enough to be implanted in the rat. The device transmits data continuously using a low power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication technology. To charge the battery wirelessly, transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) antennas were designed and fabricated. The animal experiment results clearly showed that our WPT system enables the device to monitor the ECG of a heart in various conditions continuously, while transmitting all ECG data in real-time.

The objective of this work is to reduce the number of capacitors in the Capacitor Digital to Analog Converter (CDAC). To achieve this, a hybrid type DAC has been applied where 8 Most Significant Bits (MSB)s are decided through capacitive DAC and 4 Least Significant Bits (LSB)s are decided in a Resistor DAC (RDAC). The conversion speed for this design reaches up to 6 MS/s. The prototype ADC is designed in a 90 nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. The analog and digital supply voltage range for this design are 2.7-5.5 V and 1.1-1.3 V respectively. For 6 MS/s conversion rate, this ADC achieves up to 11.8 and 11.2 effective number of bits (ENOBs), for maximum and minimum supply voltages respectively.

This protocol is more appropriate to mobility than all other usual WiFi. The use of such networks require to vehicles and Road side Units (RSU) to be equipped with 802.11p modules. Up to now such modules are not widely distributed and have high costs. In order to recover such a weakness, we present in this paper a communication architecture based on BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) messages. The coverage of such networks is lower than 802.11p but they are widely deployed over smartphones or some basic equipments as Raspberry-Pi stations. In this paper, we present an architecture which ensures communications between mobile stations and RSU using Bluetooth protocol. We have defined light messages which are derived from usual C-ITS messages mainly CAM (Cooperative Awareness Messages) and DENM (Decentralized Event Notification Messages).

For patients, doctors, and administrators, the entire process can be exhausting and confusing. Usually, patients arrive at the front-desk and wait in a queue for assistance to begin preparing to be registered or admitted. Moreover, one of the most common patient complaints in clinics are the long and uncertain waiting times to see their doctor without any status updates. This can cause high levels of patient frustration and dissatisfaction. IoT is becoming an increasingly popular solution to healthcare problems. Imagine a patient walks into the clinic for her appointment, and receives a greeting message, an admission push notification and an estimated wait time on her mobile device. This will greatly reduce wait time uncertainty and provide freedom for patients to walk around which could lead to not just better experiences but less wasted money. This paper presents our proposed solution, which we called UrNext. UrNext is a location-aware mobile-based solution to solve the problem of patients queuing at clinics using a Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacons.

In this framework, smartphones carried by campus occupants act as data mules, opportunistically retrieving data from nearby BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) equipped smart object sensors and relaying them to a backend repository. We focus specifically on dynamically varying the transmission power of the deployed BLE beacons, so as to extend their operational lifetime without sacrificing the frequency of sensor data retrieval. We propose a memetic algorithm-based power adaptation strategy that can handle deployments of thousands of beacons and tackles two distinct objectives: (1) maximizing BLE beacon lifetime, and (2) reducing the BLE scanning energy of the mules. Using real-world movement traces on the Singapore Management University campus, we show that the benefit of such mule movement-aware power adaptation: it provides reliably frequent retrieval of BLE sensor data, while achieving a significant (5-fold) increase in the sensor lifetime, compared to a traditional fixed-power approach.

Due to the lower energy consumption and higher throughput, BLE could therefore be an integral pillar of an Internet of Things (IoT) Location Based Service (LBS). Tracking a user with high accuracy is known as Micro-Location. This is a requirement of many IoT user-centric applications for indoor environments. Although several technologies have been used for tracking purposes, the accuracy has always been a serious issue. At the same time, each vendor would install different technologies. In this work, we propose to use the cutting-edge and commercially available Apple's iBeacon protocol and iBeacon BLE sensors for micro-location. We propose to leverage a control theoretic approach, namely particle filtering, in order to increase the tracking accuracy in an indoor environment. We performed extensive experiments and our results show that the proposed beacon based micro-location system can be used to locate a user in an indoor environment with an error as low as 0.27 meters.

Here, we show that v-AuNWs could also be used to design a high-performance wearable pressure sensor when combined with rational structural engineering such as pyramid microarray-based hierarchical structures. The as-fabricated pressure sensor featured a low operation voltage of 0.1 V, high sensitivity in a low-pressure regime, a fast response time of <10 ms, and high durability with stable signals for the 10 000 cycling test. In conjunction with printed electrode arrays, we could generate a multiaxial map for spatial pressure detection. Furthermore, our flexible pressure sensor could be seamlessly connected with a Bluetooth low-energy module to detect high-quality artery pulses in a wireless manner. Our solution-based gold coating strategy offers the benefit of conformal coating of nanowires onto three-dimensional microstructured elastomeric substrates under ambient conditions, indicating promising applications in next-generation wearable biodiagnostics.

The system consists of a wireless wearable respirator as well as a signal processing pipeline that runs inside the respirator, and provides a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface for applications. By sensing the airflow temperature at the exhalation valve of respirator with NTC series resistors, the breathing parameters of each respiratory cycle can be measured regardless of breathing pathways through nose or mouth. iMask takes advantage of a voltage divider with controllable divider resistors to enhance the measuring sensitivity of temperature, and a peak and valley detection algorithm with spline interpolation to increase sampling period without reducing detection accuracy. The experimental results show that the breathing parameters can be accurately measured with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.29 beats per minute (bpm) for respiratory rate. As a low cost, reusable, comfortable and low power wearing device for breath monitoring, iMask holds promise in real-world feasibility.

Because of the cost-effectiveness and easy disposal of FAST materials, they are attractive for autonomous power supplies to drive IoT sensors and devices. While bismuth-tellurium-based thermoelectric power generation modules have been commercialized, the discovery of FAST materials opens an additional route to generate power from waste heat at room temperature under a small temperature difference, which will expand the diversity of applications of thermoelectric power generation modules. This paper reports the thermoelectric properties of FAST materials synthesized by conventional laboratory-scale synthesis and mass production processes, enhancement of power factor less than 600 K through homogenization and removal of metallic precipitations, development of thermoelectric power generation modules, and the results of power generation tests. The operation of temperature/humidity sensors and wireless transmission by Bluetooth low energy communication using FAST materials-based modules under a small temperature difference at room temperature was demonstrated.

This technology offers attractive services to improve the quality of life as well as new economic markets through the exploitation of the collected data. However, these connected objects have also become attractive targets for attackers because their current security design is often weak or flawed, as illustrated by several vulnerabilities such as Mirai, Blueborne, etc. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting intrusions in smart spaces such as smarthomes, or smartfactories, that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer using machine learning techniques. The approach is designed to be independent of the large and heterogeneous set of wireless communication protocols typically implemented by connected objects such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) or proprietary communication protocols. The main concepts of the proposed approach are presented together with an experimental case study illustrating its feasibility based on data collected during the deployment of the intrusion detection approach in a smart home under real-life conditions.

In this paper, we describe the Bluetooth-based wireless protocol and interaction concept on which CalendarCast is based, present a prototypical implementation with Android smartphones and dedicated beacons, and report on results of a user study demonstrating improved task performance compared to unaugmented calendars. The motivating scenario for CalendarCast occurs quite often in a variety of contexts, for example at the end of a prior meeting or during ad-hoc conversations in the hallway. Despite a large variety of digital calendar tools, this situation still usually involves a lengthy manual comparison of free and busy time slots. CalendarCast utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) advertisement broadcasts to share the required free/busy information with a limited, localized audience, on demand only, and without revealing detailed personal information. No prior knowledge about the other participants, such as email addresses or account names, is required.

Despite having redundant bits, CRC codes are merely used as error-detecting codes due to the unavailability of a suitable decoder. Several efforts have been made to design a decoder for CRC to use as error-correcting code. The recently proposed GRAND algorithm serves as an error-correcting algorithm for CRC but has huge complexity. In this paper, a low complexity hard decision decoder is proposed for CRC with g(x) = 1 + x(5) + x(12) + x(16) which is used in IEEE 802.15.4 for IoT applications. The proposed decoder utilizes channel state information (CSI) for decoding in a Rayleigh fading channel and attained fourth-order diversity with very low complexity. The proposed decoder is especially effective at short block lengths; hence it serves as a sound decoder catering to IoT and URLLC services.

A context-aware system using mobile applications and beacons for on-premise security environments	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Beacons; Indoor localization; Context-aware computing; BLE mobile applications; Mobile computing; IoT		In this paper, we describe a mobile solution for on-premise security monitoring using Android devices and Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The system incorporates two mobile based applications, beacons and supporting cloud services. One mobile application was developed for security managers to easily configure beacons while in close proximity to a beacon for setting up a route, while the other is for security guards as they perform their rounds. We developed this system in collaboration with a security firm and an industry partner located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. We present the relevant background of work in this area, the architectural framework that we designed and developed to support the system, the applications themselves and a report on the findings of real use test case scenarios involving security managers and guards. Our system was tested in a variety of conditions and performed at an accuracy of 98%, achieved SUS usability scores of 85% and 82% for Security Managers and Security Guards respectively. It provides a low-cost, easily deployed scalable solution for security monitoring in a range of environment configurations.

The solution consists of an acquisition system of wireless signal parameters and the subsequent position system inference meanly cloud computing-based services. The proposed localization mechanism is based on a Machine Learning (ML) location algorithm stemming from the Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Received Signal Strength (RSS) footprinting method, which allow us to detect the XY-position in a regression case o the reference zones in classification inside indoor environments.

They typically associate location information, provided by GPS or Bluetooth Low Energy devices, with remote content accessible through the Internet. However, Internet connectivity, especially in outdoor spaces, is not always available or may be too costly to be used for downloading large content (e.g. when users are abroad or have a limited data plan). In this paper we propose Live Objects, a system for infrastructure-less proximity-based services. Live Objects are pervasive media-server devices, which can be discovered by users and stream locally stored media content in proximity without the need for an Internet connection. Live Objects can be installed anywhere, even in places without power supply and communication infrastructure. We demonstrate a deployment of Live Objects in an outdoor test field. Using these devices, together with an Android app and a software middleware, users can have a self-guided tour of the area, discover the interesting places, and get associated information, particularly in the form of high-resolution video.

Continuous heart rate monitoring with clinical accuracy using reflectance photoplethysmogram signals from wrist is highly challenging and presents a potential area of research. In this work, we present a wearable device in a wrist watch form factor for heart rate monitoring. The device runs on a low power ARM cortex M4 microcontroller and integrates a BLE (Bluetooth Low energy) module for wireless connectivity. A heart rate computation algorithm using reflectance photoplethysmography and a 3 axes accelerometer for motion artifact removal is presented in the paper. Heart rate computed by the wrist worn device was validated against heart rate measured using Masimo Radical-7 on 256 subjects. The validation study was conducted in a hospital setting for a duration of 1 month, after obtaining the ethics committee approval and informed consent from the subjects. Details of the experimental setup, clinical validation protocol and observations and inferences made from the study are presented.	[Preejith, S.

Furthermore, the exponential growth of mobile technologies and the widespread use of mobile devices embedding standards of next-generation Personal Area Networks (PAN), such as the Bluetooth Low Energy, come to revolutionize the way the monitoring of vital parameters is done, now following the anytime and anywhere approach with further energy efficiency. The work presented in this paper brings together the technologies addressed above in order to create a ready-to-use, simple, efficient, safe, low-cost and compatible solution capable of monitoring vital parameters and generate alerts in the presence of abnormal values.

There are various approaches that employ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi, magnetic field, object detection, and Ultra Wide Band (UNVB) for indoor space classification purposes. Many of the existing approaches need extensive pre-installed infrastructure, making the cost higher to obtain reasonable accuracy. Therefore, improvements are still required to increase the accuracy with minimum requirements of infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an approach to classify the indoor space using geomagnetic field (GMF) and radio signal strength (RSS) as the identity. The indoor space is an open big test bed divided into different indiscernible subspace. We collect GMF and RSS at each subspace and classify it using cascaded Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The experimental results show that the accuracy is significantly improved when GMF and RSS are combined to make distinct features. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed model with the state-of-the-art machine learning methods.

In this paper, we explore indoor localization algorithms using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We propose using the BLE beacon's received signal strength indication (RSSI) and the geometric distance from the current beacon to the fingerprint point in the framework of fuzzy logic for calculating the Euclidean distance for the subsequent determination of location. According to our results, the fingerprinting algorithm with fuzzy logic type-2 (hesitant fuzzy sets) is fit for use as an indoor localization method with BLE beacons. The average error of localization is only 0.43 m, and the algorithm obtains a navigation precision of 98.2 +/- 1%. This precision confirms that the algorithms provide great aid to a visually impaired person in unknown spaces, especially those designed without physical tactile guides, as confirmed by low Frechet and Hausdorff distance values and high navigation efficiency index (NEI) scores.

KAUSTat: A Wireless, Wearable, Open-Source Potentiostat for Electrochemical Measurements	2019 IEEE SENSORS	IEEE Sensors		English	Proceedings Paper	18th IEEE Sensors Conference	OCT 27-30, 2019	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Sensors Council, CMC Microsystems, Onscale, Univ Michigan		Biosensors; Electrochemical sensing; wearable; cyclic voltammetry		Advanced technology is needed every day for wireless, wearable sensors/potentiostats to record real-time measurements and monitor the chemical processes and physiological signals of the human body. Most of the potentiostats present on the market work as "black boxes" without access to their internal structure and their limited information of circuitry makes it challenging to develop new measurement methods and further integration with other instruments. Despite high resolution (e.g., measure low currents with high precision and low noise) of commercial potentiostats, the potentiostats used in laboratories are heavy, non-portable, and expensive. To fill this void, we introduce KAUSTat, a wireless, wearable, open-source potentiostat. The KAUSTat device interfaces with a smartphone to generate cyclic voltammetry curves using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. Experiments with buffer and hexacyanoferrate solutions were conducted to assess the efficiency of the device. The results generated by KAUSTat are in agreement with those of the commercial potentiostat "Emstat." Considering wireless and wearable features of KAUSTat, it represents a convenient portable device for on-site sensing with low-power requirements.

In a dense area, a leader root is elected during the leader election phase and a min-path algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal number of rings for various numbers of discoverable roots. According to the optimal configuration, the leader root connects to its one-hop neighboring roots to form the first-tier ring; each new root connects with one downstream root, and these roots connect together to form the second-tier ring until the desired outermost ring is reached. In sparse areas, each root constructs its own spanning tree subnet, finally creating a multi-ring tree scatternet. To achieve the least route discovery overhead, a multi-hop self-routing protocol is developed to efficiently deliver packets. Computer simulations show that the optimal multi-ring subnet can be determined; the optimal multi-ring tree outperforms conventional dual ring-tree (DRT) and Bluetooth hybrid ring-tree (BlueHRT) in terms of network performance.

The proposed network comprises wireless modules placed in bracelets and a necklace. It relies on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements between the bracelet and necklace modules. The measured signal is cleared of noise using the exponential moving average (EMA). Next, we use a classification algorithm based on a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) in order to detect facial touches. When the results of the classification indicate that the hand is moving toward the face, an alarm is sent through the neck module and the vibrator embedded in the wrist module is switched on. Based on the performed tests, it can be concluded that the proposed solution is characterized by high accuracy and reliability. It should be useful, especially for individuals who are regularly exposed to the risk of respiratory infections.

Bluetooth 5.x core specifications enhance the trade-off between energy requirements, communication range and flexibility. In this paper, we aim to analyse the potential of Bluetooth 5 features for VANET applications, proposing a connectionless communication system. By means of field experiments, we evaluate long range and 2 x speed features, defining a set of communication scenarios. This allows us to test both Bluetooth 5.x range and application throughput. The evaluation includes experiments of V2I communications carried out under real highway traffic conditions. The experiments conducted demonstrate that communication ranges up to 300 m may be achieved depending on the communications scenario. The results also show how throughput degrades as the distance between devices increases. The results obtained are used to discuss future work, aimed at deeper analysing Bluetooth 5 features for VANET applications, completing the development of our prototype and evaluating VANET connectionless communications with the features included in the latest Bluetooth 5.2 specification.

Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon nodes (BNs) are deployed in the localization area to emit beacon packets periodically. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) values of beacon packets sent by various BNs are measured at different reference points (RPs) and saved as RPs' fingerprints in a database. For the purpose of localization, the TD also obtains its fingerprint by measuring the beacon packet RSSI values for various BNs. FPFE then applies either the autoencoder (AE) or principal component analysis (PCA) to extract fingerprint features. It then measures the similarity between the features of PRs and the TD with the Minkowski distance. Afterwards, k RPs associated with the k smallest Minkowski distances are selected to estimate the TD's location. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the localization error of FPFE. The experimental results show that FPFE achieves an average error of 0.68 m, which is better than those of other related BLE fingerprint-based indoor localization methods.

Recent systems employ short range wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth etc. WiFi is a suitable solution when an existing network is available in a field, and IEEE 802.15.4 is employed in mesh networks. Bluetooth attracts attention in smartphone sensing because it is suitable to reduce power consumption in mobile devices. Smartphone sensing is a new data collection scheme. Smartphone sensing application usually consumes energy to collect data continuously because it runs as a background process. Therefore, users request smart data collection scheme to reduce excessive consumption of energy and to avoid the conscious operation of the application. This paper develops Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based automated data collection scheme in agricultural measurement system. The developed scheme utilizes a smartphone to realize automated measurement information collection from sensor devices. The demonstrations show the special BLE based sensor device, a data collection application, and a browsing application.

By design, BLE supports short-range, single-hop communication between a pair of BLE devices. As such, native BLE does not allow network-based policy control or in-network functions for service enhancement. These limitations are impediments to any largescale BLE based IoT deployment (e.g., in hospital environments), where such sophisticated network-based visibility and control may be required. Relying on cloud-based solutions to meet these requirements has many known shortcomings. This paper proposes an SDN-based architecture for enabling wide area IoT deployments using BLE devices at the edge. We introduce a programmable BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. BLESS can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller to enable flexible, policy-based switching, as well as various in-network operations in BLE networks. We describe the design of BLESS, its implementation using P4 and OVS, and illustrate its utility through practical use cases.	[Uddin, Mostafa; Mukherjee, Sarit; Chang, Hyunseok; Lakshman, T.

To ensure that the proposed low power transceiver can operate at 1 Mbps data rate, FSK modulation is implemented using an all-digital phase locked-loop with direct modulation technique. The SPDT switch is integrated to share the antenna and matching network between the transmitter and receiver, thus minimizing the system cost by reducing external components. The transceiver is implemented using 1P6M 55-nm CMOS technology. The die area of the transceiver with DC-DC converter is 1.79 mm(2). The power consumption of the transmitter and receiver are 6 and 5 mW, respectively, when the output power level of the transmitter is 0 dBm. The noise figure of Rx is up to 6.8 dB with respect to channel frequencies. The phase noise of the ADPLL is -84.7 and -118.9 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz and 1 MHz offset from 2.44 GHz, respectively.

However, BLE beacon networks suffer from short battery lifetime, which induces additional maintenance costs. In this paper, we propose a novel user existence-aware BLE beacon firmware, User-B, that extends BLE beacon lifetime by changing its operating configuration. Leveraging scan response and request features of Bluetooth Core Specifications, a mechanism for the detection of nearby user smartphones is proposed. Furthermore, we present an energy consumption model of the proposed firmware, along with an optimization problem for finding the optimal configuration that minimizes the overall energy consumption and overhead induced by switching delay.

This context promotes the ability to satisfy the growing demand for innovative measuring systems, increasingly popular with intelligent nodes, totally wireless, easy to install that require the least possible maintenance. This paper aims to contribute to the state-of-the-art with an energy-autonomous and battery-free measurement platform designed to measure the ambient light power when its level exceeds the Limit of Detection (LoD) threshold. The proposed system consists of a single photovoltaic transducer to harvest energy and simultaneously detect ambient light. The result is a wireless measurement platform, which requires neither a battery nor a specific ambient light sensor, with the immediate advantage of achieving greater energy efficiency and using fewer components. The device implements off-the-shelf components on a printed circuit board (PCB) with a tag size of 2 x 2 cm(2). Data communication is via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and, the device can acquire energy and detect ambient light from 250 lux.

To this extent, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) represents the best candidate in the low range communication technologies to estimate the proximity distance between smartphones by means of ranging algorithm based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements. Although promising, the high variability of the radio propagation channel for ISM-band technologies suggests that a deep analysis of BLE is needed in order to isolate the different propagation factors. In this paper we show, through extensive measurements, the fluctuation of BLE channel in various environments and provide a ray tracing model to fully capture the BLE channel behavior. Results show how unpredictable BLE measurements become at increasing distances and under different positioning configurations, leading to misleading detections for contact tracing apps. A possible solution could be to introduce the use of mathematical models to capture core aspects of population mobility in order to estimate realistic exposure information.

While not being designed directly for mesh operation, recent works have shown that both connected and broadcasts mesh are possible, this latter one being ultimately included in the standard. For any robust operation in a connected BLE mesh network, especially for high reliability and low-latency operations like healthcare, the control parameters need to be carefully chosen in order to avoid congestion and packet loss but the relationships between controllable parameters and final network performance have not yet been investigated in BLE mesh networks. In this work, we show that it is possible to infer the relationships between the controllable and observable network parameters by using a mutual information based structure learning approach; we show, in fact, how each setting such as transmit power, connection interval, source rate, impact overall network performance figures of merit such as end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and network build time.

In the wake of these developments, this paper proposes a framework for an IoT home security system that is secure, expandable, and accessible. Congruent with the ideals of the IoT, we are proposing a system utilizing an ultra-low-power wireless sensor network which would interface with a central hub via Bluetooth 4, commonly referred to as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to monitor the home. Additionally, the system would interface with an Amazon Echo to accept user voice commands. The aforementioned central hub would also act as a web server and host an internet accessible configuration page from which users could monitor and customize their system. An internet-connected system would carry the capability to notify the users of system alarms via SMS or email. Finally, this proof of concept is intended to demonstrate expandability into other areas of home automation or building monitoring functions in general.

Monitoring and separating the activities of a specific individual in a multi-residential home is still, however, a significant challenge for these smart home applications. This paper proposes a new human identification sensor, which can efficiently differentiate multiple residents in a home environment to detect their height as a unique bio-feature. This sensor includes three sensing/communication modules: pyroelectric infrared (PIR) occupancy, ultrasound array, and bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication modules. The PIR occupancy module is used to detect the moving direction, while the ultrasound array module detects the moving residents' height. The combination of these two sensing technologies can be used to then detect the moving velocity. The BLE advertising mode is then used to communicate these data to the data server. A new embedded algorithm increased the energy efficiency of this identification technology. A comprehensive modeling and experiments are done to assess the performance of this sensor and the results are provided.

Naturally, the security of BLE received much attention from both researchers and attackers. In another aspect, the BLE specifications provide the security guidelines for BLE deployments. Due to various reasons, the developers do not follow the guidelines in the implementation process, which introduces the misconfiguration issue. However, identifying these BLE misconfigurations in IoT device firmware is quite challenging. In this work, we do not handle the BLE-enabled devices directly. Instead, we focus on the security misconfiguration issues in their companion mobile apps, which can reflect the deployment conditions of the corresponding devices. Further, we designed an analysis tool - BSC-Checker to detect the misconfigurations based on pre-defined checking strategies. With BSC-Checker, we conducted large-scale experiments on 4,589 apps from multiple app markets. The result shows that the BLE configurations of most BLE apps disobey at least one security rule, and the current BLE deployment status is not optimistic.

The distance between the pairs of tags and the anchor is crucial for calculating the tag's position. The BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) estimated the distance from the received signal strength, while the UWB (Ultra-Wide Band) estimated the distance from the propagation delay. Although the signal strength in BLE has more easily interfered in comparison with the propagation delay in UWB, the BLE tag is smaller, cheaper, and easier to carry. In this paper, we focused on implementing positioning techniques to track visitors' location while browsing the exhibition hall. The BLE is chosen for this paper based on economic scalability. Moreover, the installation time of anchors to the building remains a significant obstacle due to the limited time of preparing the venue. This obstacle includes the process of distributing tags to visitors and bringing them back. We have implemented our system on 6,000-20,000 square meters, with 20-25 meters high as a studied case.

However, most of today's smartwatches unsecurely communicate with the user's mobile phone over Bluetooth Low Energy, leaving personal sensitive information vulnerable to security attacks. Due to the size and resource constraints in smartwatches, security features have been largely neglected. We argue that enforcing encryption as a baseline defense on smartwatch communications can be done without causing significant performance degradation and battery drainage. We implemented four different encryption algorithms (AES, Twofish, RSA, and EIGamal) on a smartwatch and evaluated their effects on the device's battery life, memory, CPU utilization, and communication latency. We tested these algorithms on various types of data exchanged between wearables and mobile phones: simple messages, small files, and sensory data. Our experiments show that enforcing any of the encryption algorithms we evaluated has no statistically significant negative impact on the smartwatch's performance and that the performance overhead introduced by these algorithms will not be perceptible to the user.

It builds on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol and allows devices to extend the range and create a mesh network. BM introduces a publisher/ observer structure where a publisher node can broadcast a packet, known also as an advertisement, and all observers can receive the packet. Typically, in BM networks flooding is used to propagate the advertisements. Flooding is known to suffer from broadcast storm problem and be nonreliable. To improve packet delivery ratio we propose an approach where only a few nodes, relays, are involved in packet forwarding. Selection of the relay nodes, which is a focus of the paper, is a nontrivial task: on the one hand, a minimization of number of relays is desired, on the other hand, using a minimum dominated set would not provide redundancy. We consider three different relay selection mechanisms and develop their extensions that are capable to operate in a distributed fashion. Their performance is evaluated via extensive simulations.

However, in the technical literature there are no practical studies to analyze the effect of such interferences in Bluetooth low energy (BLE) or Bluetooth 5 wireless communications. Hence, a suitable Bluetooth 5 system-on-chip module has been proposed for implementation in electrical substations. Correspondingly, a Raspberry Pi 3 (Central) was chosen to act as a gateway. The wireless connectivity between these two elements was tested under very intense corona conditions, which were generated by means of a controlled needle-to-plate corona air gap. The corona discharges were conducted by using high-voltage AC, positive DC and negative DC generators. Different experiments were conducted by changing the distance between wireless device and the corona region. Experimental results presented in this work shows the high immunity level of Bluetooth 5 in front of corona discharges, thus ensuring a suitable behavior of this wireless system in substations.

A Comparative Analysis of BLE and 6LoWPAN For U-HealthCare Applications	2013 7TH IEEE GCC CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION (GCC)	IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition GCCCE		English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)	NOV 17-20, 2013	Doha, QATAR	IEEE		U-healthcare system; BLE; Zigbee; IEEE 802.15.4; 6LoWPAN		For decades, there exist a variety of low-power wireless technologies deployed for healthcare applications such as Zigbee/IEEE802.15.4, Bluetooth, ANT, NFC, IrDA. However, the recently announced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology claims to offer many new compelling features and is expected to get wide adoption by many mobile manufacturers around the world and hence be included in daily life mobile devices. Therefore, it is important to provide future adopters with a thorough yet insightful evaluation of this technology as contrasted to competing ones in the market today. In this paper, we present such evaluation from an experimental point of view as well as referring to technical specifications from manufacturers. The discussion is geared toward assessing the extent to which theses technologies can meet the stringent requirements for u-healthcare applicability. BLE and 6LoWPAN showed greater potentials for such applicability in terms of power demand, bit rate and latency. Nevertheless, BLE was found to be most robust to obstacles and was operable using single coin cell.

However, such applications can only detect fall accidents; therefore, a system that can prevent fall accidents is desirable. Bed falls account for more than half of patient falls and are preceded by a clear warning indicator: the patient attempting to get out of bed. This study designed and implemented an Internet of Things module, namely, Bluetooth low-energy-enabled Accelerometer-based Sensing In a Chip-packaging (BASIC) module, with a tilt-sensing algorithm based on the patented low-complexity COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC)-based algorithm for tilt angle conversions. It is applied for detecting the postural changes (from lying down to sitting up) and to protect individuals at a high risk of bed falls by prompting caregivers to take preventive actions and assist individuals trying to get up. This module demonstrates how motion and tilt sensing can be applied to bed fall prevention. The module can be further miniaturized or integrated into a wearable device and commercialized in smart health-care applications for bed fall prevention in hospitals and homes.

Likewise, the BLE has adopted Gaussian frequency shift-keying (GFSK) signalling due to its power and spectral efficiencies, which are the most fundamental performance criteria for modulation schemes. For this reason, it is worthwhile to research and develop transceivers that maintain these advantages and achieve a low-complexity implementation for the digital modulator and demodulator. Different techniques have been proposed for this purpose, such as hardware usage optimisation, efficient pulse shaping and decomposition of the signal. This study presents a novel linear GFSK demodulator which has the following attractive advantages: low complexity, near-optimal performance in the additive white Gaussian noise channel and the possibility of operating with different GFSK modulators (with a nominal modulation index of 0.5) so it could be applied in BLE devices. In addition, the theoretical error probability is obtained and compared with simulation results.

The processing in the analog domain is based on simple well-known RADAR amplitude monopulse antenna techniques. Then, using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) delivered by a commercial MiMo WiFi cards, the DoA is estimated using the so-called digital monopulse function. Due to the hybrid analog digital architecture, the digital processing is extremely simple, so that DoA estimation is performed without using IQ data from specific hardware. The simplicity and robustness of the proposed hybrid analog digital MiMo architecture is demonstrated for the ISM 2.45 GHz WiFi band. Also, the limitations with respect to multipath effects are studied in detail. As a proof of concept, an array of two MiMo WiFi DoA monopulse readers is distributed to localize the two-dimensional position of WiFi devices. This cost-effective hybrid solution can be applied to all WiFi standards and other Internet of Things narrowband radio protocols, such as Bluetooth Low Energy or Zigbee.

We develop a novel and simplified probabilistic IMU motion model as the proposal distribution of the sequential Monte-Carlo technique to track the robot trajectory. Our algorithm can globally localize and track a robot with a priori unknown location, given an informative prior map of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Also, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem that serves as the Back-end of the algorithm mentioned above (Front-end). Thus, by simultaneously solving for the robot trajectory and the map of BLE beacons, we recover a continuous and smooth trajectory of the robot, corrected locations of the BLE beacons, and the time-varying IMU bias. The evaluations achieved using hardware show that through the proposed closed-loop system the localization performance can be improved; furthermore, the system becomes robust to the error in the map of beacons by feeding back the optimized map to the Front-end.

To save costs, these networks use modest devices with limited resources (bandwidth, power) or legacy technology. Technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Lora Wide Area Networks (LoRAWAN), Zigbee, legacy WIFI among others, are suited for such applications. Since bandwidth is a limited resource for such networks, route discovery needs to use as little as possible, leaving most of the bandwidth available for data transfer. In this paper, the routing protocol for use in wireless, multihop ad-hoc networks, the Ad-Hoc Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol is compared to a novel routing protocol called Cluster Based AODV (CLUBAA). The comparison is made using simulations, and the results show CLUBAA to have better bandwidth utilization due to its low Normalized Routing Overhead (NRO) for infrequent route discovery requests. The results further expand on the region of the curve where CLUBAA outperformed AODV, showing that there is a niche area where CLUBAA could be a good bandwidth saving alternative to AODV.

The implant is hermetically sealed in a ceramic enclosure and encapsulated in medical grade silicone rubber, and then underwent active tests at accelerated aging conditions at 100 degrees C for 15 consecutive days. The stimulator microelectronics are implemented in a 0.6-mu m CMOS technology, with a crosstalk reduction scheme to minimize cross-channel interference, and high-speed power and data telemetry for battery-less operation. A wearable transmitter equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy radio link, and a custom graphical user interface provide real-time, remotely controlled stimulation.

The technologies LPWAN LoRA and WPAN BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) are found in low-cost devices making use of unlicensed frequencies. The merge of their features would allow the emergence of applications that transmit long-range data (up to 45 km) using low energy consumption, low manufacturing cost, and simplified implementation, eliminating mobile operators dependence. In this work, we integrate LPWAN and WPAN using LoRa and BLE in a paradigm of Fog/ Edge Computing, allowing the execution of the procedures at the edges of the network, making possible the transmission of only consolidated data to the cloud. We implemented a LoRa-BLE testbed using Lopy4 - Pycon, and simulated SC scenarios using LoRaSim. The set of results obtained by the testbed and the simulation allows us to evaluate the viability of merge LoRa-BLE to IoT SC applications.

BLEDoorGuard: A Device-Free Person Identification Framework Using Bluetooth Signals for Door Access	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Access control; activity recognition; Bluetooth; device-free	FREE LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM	Recently, door access control with Internet of Things has become increasingly popular in the field of security. However, conventional approaches such as video-based or biological information-based cannot satisfy the requirements of personal privacy protection in the modern society. Hence, a wireless signal-based technique which does not need users to carry any devices, called device-free have been introduced in recent years to detect and identify persons. In this paper, we present BLEDoorGuard, a wireless, invisible, and robust door access system which leverages received signal strength indicator from Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons to recognize a person who accesses a door. We evaluated BLEDoorGuard in two real-world scenarios: the first is an office with a key lock, and the second is a meeting room with swipe card access. We exploit the characteristics of use of BLE for person identification and propose a two-step algorithm with multiple classifiers. We demonstrate that BLEDoorGuard is capable of identifying the actual user during door access with an accuracy of 69% and 62% among groups of 6 and 10 people, respectively.

As an extension to this, we aim to provide on-the-go personalization of vehicle-feature settings and enable cloud-based passenger-vehicle connectivity. This calls for both passenger identification and in-vehicle localization of the passenger. In this paper, we propose a novel passenger identification and localization system, specifically tuned for a vehicular environment, using low cost Bluetooth low energy based beacons. A communication device functioning on passenger end is used to constantly monitor the Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) from a set of wireless beacons fixed inside a vehicle. These RSSI values are exploited to locate the passenger and intimate the cloud to provide personalized feature settings. We propose proximity based and machine learning based localization techniques and analyze their performance. Also, we conduct an exhaustive experimental analysis to arrive at an optimum placement of beacons and present a demonstration of in-vehicle personalization with a real-time use case.

PM2.5, which refers to particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m, is the product of many common combustion reactions and poses a particularly serious health risk. The small size of the particle allows it to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Due to the highly localized nature of air pollution, and to enable individuals and institutions to monitor their real-time exposure to PM2.5 easily, we designed Halo, an air quality monitor costing less than $100. Halo, powered by solar energy, measures reflected IR light to determine the particulate concentration in the air, and it uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate pollution levels to a users phone. From the phone, users can examine personal air quality levels or view aggregated data from multiple devices on a crowd-sourced pollution map. Field test results at Santa Clara University and in a Santa Clara County elementary school demonstrate that Halo can accurately track and measure personal air quality.

By leveraging the tools provided by the Android system to scan and analyze the surrounding environment for Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The data obtained from the beacons is then broadcasted through the Android system to other applications and Virtual Reality games running on the same Android device. Beacons data contain information about the signal received from each beacon. This data is used to estimate the distance between the beacon and the smartphone. The estimated distance can be used in Virtual Reality applications to change the location of object. The paper proposes a method that achieves the required task from the moment a beacon is detected until the data is passed and used inside the Virtual Reality application. The evaluation of the proposed system is mainly based on the resulted latency, accuracy of the estimated distance and CPU usage. The result shows the latency can be controlled and minimized to ensure smooth Virtual Reality experience.

Such systems should take advantage of the large amount of wireless networks and radio interfaces already incorporated in most mobile consumer devices. Among the existing radio interfaces, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 is called to play a major role in the deployment of energy efficient ubiquitous services. In this paper, we first show that the high sensitivity of BLE4.0 to fast fading makes infeasible the use of radio propagation models to directly estimate the distance between a reference transmitter and the mobile device. We then explore the use of supervised learning algorithms towards the development of radio maps of beacons analysing in-depth two metrics accuracy and mean error. Our approach also explores two main parameters: (i) Transmission power (Tx) of the BLE4.0 beacons; and (ii) Physical characteristics of the area. Based on our results, we argue that the mean error can be improved up to 28% configuring the two main parameters.

After decades of conceptual inception of the IoT, in recent years a large variety of communication technologies has gradually emerged, reflecting a large diversity of application domains and of communication requirements. Such heterogeneity and fragmentation of the connectivity landscape is currently hampering the full realization of the IoT vision, by posing several complex integration challenges. In this context, the advent of 5G cellular systems, with the availability of a connectivity technology, which is at once truly ubiquitous, reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient, is considered as a potentially key driver for the yet-to emerge global IoT. In the present paper, we analyze in detail the potential of 5G technologies for the IoT, by considering both the technological and standardization aspects.

J	Ivanov, R				Ivanov, Rosen			Accuracy analysis of BLE beacon-based localization in smart buildings	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND SMART ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Indoor Positioning; BLE beacons; localization; smart sensor systems	INDOOR LOCALIZATION; INTERNET; THINGS	The majority of services that deliver personalized content in smart buildings require accurate localization of their clients. This article presents an analysis of the localization accuracy using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The aim is to present an approach to create accurate Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) using algorithms that can be implemented in real time on platforms with low computing power. Parameters on which the localization accuracy mostly depends are analyzed: localization algorithm, beacons' density, deployment strategy, and noise in the BLE channels. An adaptive algorithm for pre-processing the signals from the beacons is proposed, which aims to reduce noise in beacon's data and to capture visitor's dynamics. The accuracy of five range-based localization algorithms in different use case scenarios is analyzed. Three of these algorithms are specially designed to be less sensitive to noise in radio channels and require little computing power. Experiments conducted in a simulated and real environment show that using proposed algorithms the localization accuracy less than 1 m can be obtained.

There is, however, no currently available solution that covers all possible scenarios. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based methods, although the most widely researched, still suffer from problems due to environment noise. In this paper, we present a system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons attached to the desks to localize students in exam rooms and, at the same time, automatically register them for the given exam. By using Kalman Filters (KFs) and discretizing the location task, the presented solution is capable of achieving 100% accuracy within a distance of 45cm from the center of the desk. As the pandemic gets more controlled, with our lives slowly transitioning back to normal, there are still sanitary measures being applied. An example being the necessity to show a certification of vaccination or previous disease. Those certifications need to be manually checked for everyone entering the university's building, which requires time and staff. With that in mind, the automatic check for Covid certificates feature is also built into our system.

Motivated by the BLE backscatter, in this paper, we investigate the price-based bandwidth allocation for multi-user backscatter communication (BackCom), where multiple BackCom users are allocated to different non-overlapping sub-channels and all users share the whole spectrum in a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) manner. Each BackCom user is charged by the primary user (PU) in the same sub-channel for a price, which is proportional to the allocated bandwidth and can be viewed as the cost for bandwidth sharing. A Stackelberg game is formulated to study joint maximization of the revenue of PUs and the utility function of each BackCom user subject to the total bandwidth constraint on the PUs and the individual bandwidth constraints on each BackCom user. Stackelberg Equilibriums (SEs) for two proposed schemes are investigated in closed-form expressions. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed schemes in improving the revenue performance of PUs and the sum capacity performance of BackCom users.

However, because of the uncertainties in fire development, there is no perfect solution. This research proposes a fire evacuation management framework which takes advantage of an information-rich building information modeling (BIM) model and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based indoor real-time location system (RTLS) to dynamically push personalized evacuation route recommendations and turn-by-turn guidance to the smartphone of a building occupant. The risk score (RS) for each possible route is evaluated as a weighted summation of risk level index values of all risk factors for all segments along the route, and the route with the lowest RS is recommended to the evacuee. The system will automatically re-evaluate all routes every 2 s based on the most updated information, and the evacuee will be notified if a new and safer route becomes available. A case study with two testing scenarios was conducted for a commercial office building in Tianjin, China, in order to verify this framework.

It facilitates the creation of piconets and reducing product development time and cost. It is until 2017 that the Bluetooth special interest group releases the Mesh Profile allowing a multi-hop interconnection through BLE's advertisements. Being a relatively new technology, this paper aims to experimentally evaluate its performance and investigate the limits of the technology in terms of data delivery capacity in monitoring applications. Several experiments are performed by deploying a number of BLE nodes in an office environment, making a multi-hop network. The performance of the network in terms of packet delivery to a base station is measured in each experiment. Moreover, experiments including mobile nodes are carried out under the multi-hop setup to test the behaviour of the protocol when some nodes move around. The experimental results show that the relay nodes impose critical limitations for message delivery in multi-hop networks, limiting the usage of the BLM technology for many monitoring applications.

However, the outcomes of existing adherence monitoring methods such as Direct Observation Therapy (DOT), Video Observation Therapy (VOT), and Direct/Indirect Monitoring Technology need to improve. This paper introduces the notion of a digital collaborative framework (DCF) that involves many stakeholders for personalized treatment adherence-monitoring in the treatment journey of a patient. The framework is conceived to strengthen the collaboration of multiple stakeholders in monitoring adherence to Tuberculosis (TB) treatment. The stakeholders include Healthcare workers (HCW), family, and friends who are able to support the patients on TB treatment for positive adherence behaviour. To do this, a wearable outdoor, and waterproof smartwatch paired with the smartphone of the TB patient via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. This is then combined with a mobile app service are to realize a DCF. The framework will enable real-time data collection and analytics to stimulate differentiated monitoring of individual TB patients for TB treatment adherence. The applicability of the DCF is highlighted by using a sample use case and a response scenario.

SDN-Based Multi-Protocol Edge Switching for IoT Service Automation	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Protocol independent; SDN; IoT; BLE; Zigbee; P4		This paper proposes Muppet, an edge-based multi-protocol architecture for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployment and service automation. The crux of Muppet is a P4-based switch that inserts itself in between communicating IoT devices that can use different protocols. The switches are networked over IP to support wide area deployment and managed using centralized SDN control for scalability. Muppet provides many of the benefits of both native peer-to-peer and widely used cloud-centric approaches while avoiding their drawbacks. For example, Muppet offers low-latency and low-energy benefits of the peer-to-peer approach, while enabling wide-area, cross-protocol automation similar to the cloud-based solutions. We describe the P4 design and prototype realization of the switch using two very popular, but widely disparate, IoT protocols, namely, Bluetooth low energy and Zigbee. Through experiments, we show that Muppet is as efficient as peer-to-peer in terms of delay and energy usage, and scalable and programmable as cloud-based solutions. We illustrate its utility through practical use cases.	[Uddin, Mostafa; Mukherjee, Sarit; Chang, Hyunseok; Lakshman, T.

The choice of transport, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), on the other hand, has an impact on the Internet of Things (IoT) application level performance, especially over a wireless medium. The motivation of this work is to look at the impact of the protocol stack on performance over two different wireless medium realizations, namely Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi. The use case studied is infrequent small reports sent from the sensor device to a central cloud storage over a last mile radio access link. We find that while CoAP/UDP based transport performs consistently better both in terms of latency and power consumption over both links, MQTT/TCP may also work when the use requirements allow for longer latency providing better reliability. All in all, the full connectivity stack needs to be considered when designing an IoT deployment.

In smart metering management systems, several incentives, such as demand response programs, time-of-use, and real-time pricing, are applied by utilities in order to encourage customers to reduce their load during peak load hours. However, it is usually a hassle for residential customers to manually respond to prices that vary over time. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) as a support for a home energy management (HEM) system based on Bluetooth low energy, called BluHEMS.

Mobile users then would be able to ubiquitously and spontaneously interact with things they encounter, enabling a wealth of diverse usage scenarios and applications. Currently, however, ST interaction requires a pre-controlled Internet or network connection as well as the prior installation of the ST-specific interaction interface, i.e., smartphone app. Users can thus only interact with known things, in contrast to the vision of spontaneous, ubiquitous discovery and interaction. We thus propose STIF (Smart Things Interaction Framework), enabling local wireless discovery of STs spontaneously via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Visible Light Communication, or Acoustic Communication. STIF allows STs to transmit their interaction interface directly to users and supports interaction based on user input via touch and AR GUIs as well as motion and speech recognition. We implement STIF for Android phones as well as Arduino and Raspberry Pi things and demonstrate the real-life applicability of the supported communication and interaction techniques.

It is designed to generate the local oscillator frequency ranging from 2.40GHz to 2.48GHz for a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver. A self-biasing linear trans -conductance technique is used in the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) for the improvement of phase noise. In order to reduce the effect of spur on noise, a third-order sigma-delta modulation (SDM) is utilized. A lock detector based on dichotomy is used for the phase locked loop (PLL) to select the switched capacitor code automatically and lock faster. The proposed PLL could operate from 2.33 GILL to 2.59 GHz. According to the post -simulation results at 4.88GHz, the phase noise at 1 MHz offset of the VCO and the PLL is -113.17dBc/Hz and -106.6dBc/Flz, respectively. The total power consumption is 2.4 mW and the whole PLL area is only 0.27x0.55 mm(2).

The system operates from an RF signal with a power as low as -20 dBm and includes an RF to DC converter, a storage super capacitor and a voltage DC/DC up-conversion. The system components are sized to provide the required electric energy to operate the connected object. The tested connected object includes an ARM microcontroller, an ultra low-power sensor (temperature, pressure and humidity) and a Bluetooth Low Energy interface for a wireless transmission toward a terminal such as a smartphone or tablet. It requires 200 mu J per transmission cycle, which must be provided by the proposed harvesting system. This system is tested in an anechoic chamber and using a constant power RF signal to characterize the energy recovery time needed for measuring and transmitting the sensor data. Promising results show that the system is capable of sending data after 5 hours of RF energy harvesting from a source distant with one meter.

However, the insufficiency of global positioning system and other outdoor positioning systems in indoor environments complicates the development of indoor tracking and positioning systems. In this paper, an indoor tracking and monitoring system has been designed using the new generation devices for the Internet of Things. By using WiFi and bluetooth low energy (BLE) signals at the same time, we developed an accurate and precise positioning system. In the developed system, we have used the NodeMCU-ESP-32 module to receive the broadcasted WiFi and BLE signals from smartphones. The NodeJS-based HTTP server combines the received information from ESPs and determines the location of the mobile device with the proposed algorithm based on the weighted average method. NodeJS server provides instant information about anchors and mobile nodes to the users over a web application. The proposed weighted average-based method can determine the real-time room-based location of the target asset with acceptable precision.

The MG controller was composed of three pairs of a pressure sensor and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless data logger for the upper and lower jaws. The pressure sensors and the BLE data loggers were sandwiched by two dental MG materials so that they were not exposed in the oral environment. Pressure applied to the sensor was measured as a resistance change, and an algorithm that exploited the sensor output to regulate the control of an external device, such as a smart device, was developed. The pressure sensor encapsulated in the MG material showed a dynamic range of 1.7-29 N. In an experiment using a jaw phantom, the response time to applied occlusal pressure was 0.18 s. Finally, the use of the measured pressure to manipulate a pointer in a smart device application was demonstrated. The results indicate that the developed MG controller enables the manipulation of devices in one's vicinity via occlusion.

CARE: An IoT based System for Passenger Service and Comfort in Railways	2017 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS (COMSNETS)	International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	JAN 04-08, 2017	Bangalore, INDIA	Cisco Syst, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Serv, Google, Xerox, IBM Res, Robert Bosch GmbH, Adobe Syst, FIDO Alliance, IEEE			MOBILE AGENTS	Railways constitute one of the most extensively used mode of transportation in the world. The global passenger traffic is expected to grow steadily in the coming years. This growth in traffic thus calls for a corresponding increase in the comfort and service provided to passengers on-board a railway train. In this paper, we propose CARE, an Internet of Things (IoT) based system for catering to passenger services and requests in railway trains. The system leverages the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to track the location of crew members (mobile resources) within a train. An On-line Proximity-Aware Mobile (OPAM) multi-objective resource allocation algorithm has been devised which on the basis of service arrival time, location information and workload factor, allocates crew members to the requests from the passengers. We have experimentally evaluated the performance of our approach and found it to be far better than the conventionally used purely centralized method. For inter train and station scenarios, a mobile agent based solution has been proposed to locate the resources not available within a train.

We exploit multiple wireless sniffers to pervasively collect human mobility data from people with mobile devices and identify similarities and the group mobility based on the wireless fingerprints. We propose a method which initially converts the wireless packets collected by the sniffers into people's wireless fingerprints. The method then determines group mobility by finding the statuses of people at certain times (dynamic/static) and the space correlation of dynamic people. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we conduct real world experiments by collecting data from 10 participants carrying Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons in an office environment for a two-week period. The proposed approach captures space correlation with 95% and group mobility with 79% accuracies on average. With the proposed approach we successfully 1) detect the groups and individual movements and 2) generate social networks based on the group mobility characteristics.

However, most existing technologies cannot satisfy all these requirements. Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), named iBeacon, has emerged as a leading candidate in this domain and has become an almost industry standard for PBS. However, it has several limitations. It suffers from poor proximity detection accuracy due to its reliance on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). To improve proximity detection accuracy of iBeacons, we present two algorithms that address the inherent flaws in iBeacon's current proximity detection approach. Our first algorithm, Server-side Running Average (SRA), uses the path-loss model-based estimated distance for proximity classification. Our second algorithm, Server-side Kalman Filter (SKF), uses a Kalman filter in conjunction with SRA. Our experimental results show that SRA and SKF perform better than the current moving average approach utilized by iBeacons. SRA results in about a 29% improvement while SKF results in about a 32% improvement over the current approach in proximity detection accuracy.

However, due to the scarcity of land in Singapore, smart farming technologies are used to increase yield in smaller spaces. A smart farming solution can be split into four main components, physical structure, data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. However, to achieve a higher yield, crops have to be grown in a controlled environment, and there is a challenge to find suitable technology to monitor and control these farms. The paper discussed multiple standard data acquisition protocols, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Zigbee, and Wi-Fi, along with IoT data acquisition protocols such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The need to use 6LoWPAN at the adaption layer to bridge between the standard and IoT data acquisition protocols was also discussed. The paper then implemented the selected protocols and conducted experiments on power consumption and distance range to determine the most suitable protocol to be implemented in that smart farm.

Unfortunately, many edge devices that are pervasively embedded into infrastructure or implanted into humans are severely resource-constrained. As performing computations at the edge becomes increasingly important to meet latency deadlines and retain sensitive data locally, severe resource constraints present a challenge because many algorithms are too large to fit on a single edge device. In this paper, we focus on distributing inference for neural networks (NNs) with convolution and fully connected layers across multiple edge nodes. In order to improve efficiency on severely resource-constrained edge nodes for diverse NN architectures we present an end-to-end, automated approach, DENNI, that optimizes NN distribution with minimal nodes while meeting memory constraints. When targeting a network of edge nodes with 256KB of nonvolatile memory connected with Bluetooth Low Energy, DENNI successfully distributes NN inference for a variety of machine learning algorithms across multiple edge nodes where other, static approaches cannot.

All main actors of the domain are spending a lot of money in order to master all issues. Radio coverage is one of the most important issue Indeed, vehicles could be connected if a minimum density is provided. In real cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS), we use an infrastructure which connects road side units (RSU) with a central station managed by road operators. RSU are deployed in order to enhance area coverage and to disseminate messages about traffic or events on roads when road operators have information to disseminate. However, RSU are not deployed everywhere. In order to extend the coverage of these networks, we usually use cellular networks. But in some specific cases (mainly on highways), cellular networks may not cover the area, we suggest to deploy Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to be able to cover the remaining area. In this paper, we propose a methodology which allows to cover all relevant areas which will receive events for vehicles.

However, there are mismatches between using resources of mobile devices and services in the cloud such as the different communication protocol and different input and output methods. In this paper, we propose a language service infrastructure for mobile environments to combine these services. The proposed language service infrastructure allows users to use and mashup existing language resources on both cloud environments and their mobile devices. Furthermore, it allows users to flexibly use services in the cloud or services on mobile devices in their composite service without implementing several different composite services that have the same functionality. A case study of Mobile Shopping Translation System using both a service in the cloud (translation service) and services on mobile devices (Bluetooth low energy (BLE) service and text-to-speech service) is introduced.

Motorized Wheelchair with Bluetooth Control and Automatic Obstacle Avoidance	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Motorized wheel chair; Wireless remote; Bluetooth; Collision detection		The new innovation in technology has led to a lot of improvement in an electric wheelchair assisted by Glove. The work presented here is a model of a motorized wheelchair system that is controlled wirelessly using a glove. Alongside manual control, the wheelchair system is also enabled with automatic obstacle avoidance. Bluetooth Low Energy protocol is used for wireless control. Dual ultrasonic sensors on either side of the caster wheels on the wheelchair are used for obstacle avoidance. The glove, which is the main method of control will have a simple switch design implemented with the help of conductive ink as a means to control the direction of the movement of the wheelchair. The microcontroller onboard the wheelchair will process the input received wirelessly from the glove and data from the ultrasonic sensors to determine the direction the wheelchair should move in. The goal of this wheelchair system is to try and provide the best possible control method for motorized wheelchairs to simplify the lives of people who are dependent on such wheelchairs due to disabilities or accidents.

However, they feature low sensor-to-sensor and in-sensor uniformity as well as unpredictable response and high stiffness. This study exploits the gap control of an auxeticpatterned elastomer to develop a piezo-transmittance based strain sensor. Gap opening mechanism in the negative Poisson's ratio metamaterial with rotating square structures makes the sensor free from these limitations; thus, achieving a designable response and low stiffness. In addition, high sensor-to-sensor ((root-meansquare deviation (RSD) < 3.5%) and in-sensor (RSD < 5%) uniformities are achieved by uniform metal-deposited light-blocking film. Finally, the developed sensor has been integrated with a solar cell and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 to afford a self-powered wireless strain sensing system that is successfully applied to structural health monitoring and human motion monitoring.

However, owing to the radio devices reconfigured or deteriorated, the radio map will be degraded, rendering the positioning outcomes unreliable. We introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model, termed Radio Map Anomaly Detection for Fingerprint Indoor Positioning with GAN (RAD-GAN), which trains only the normal RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) samples to learn the normality distribution of the radio signal in the spatial indoor domain. We exploit an encoder-decoder-encoder neural network for latent feature extraction. Afterward, an adversarial training scheme is employed to minimize the reconstruction error both within RSSI space and latent feature space. The higher reconstruction deviation of the RSSI vector is indicative of an anomaly from a normal distribution. We evaluate RAD-GAN in a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) signal environment with the power gain actively modified and the public UJI long-term Wi-Fi fingerprinting dataset. Experimental results show that RAD-GAN is more sensitive and robust than the former state-of-the-art models.

The antenna is a compact third Koch fractal shape, fed by a coaxial probe for more compactness. The conversion circuit is a full-wave rectifier with a differential output, each DC polarity is provided by a two-stage Dickson voltage multiplier. Measurement results show a significant increase of the output DC voltage for the one, four, and nine cells rectenna arrays. They provide, for power density of 1.7 mu W/cm(2), an output DC voltage of 0.9, 2.2, and 4.1 Volts, respectively.

In particular, the objective is development of advanced signal processing and machine learning solutions to micro-locate and track a person within a delimited physical space (e.g. building) using BLE locating infrastructure installed within this space. In this regard and as the first step, the paper focuses on evaluation and validation of RSSI fluctuations under different environmental conditions. Therefore, the first goal of the paper is to implement a Location-Based Services (LBS) platform consisting of two main sub-systems, i.e., acquisition sub-system, and the Fusion Centre (FC). The second goal of the paper is to test and validate effects of different parameters on the RSSI values and on tracking performance.

Wireless fingerprinting based on BLE beacons has emerged as an increasingly popular solution for fine-grained indoor localization. Inspired by the idea of mobility tracking used in the cellular network, this paper proposes a BLE-based tracking system, designated as BTrack, to learn the location area (LA) of an indoor user based on the reported wireless fingerprinting combined with statistical analysis. We propose a new particle Markov chain model to evaluate the LA-level performance regarding the visibility area in an environment with large obstacles. In the presence of sight obstructions, BTrack is evaluated using a real-world test bed built in a library with tall bookshelves. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the mean distance error and the LA prediction accuracy considering the direct line-of-sight. Compared with the existing methods, BTrack reduces the average localization error by 25% and improves the average prediction accuracy by more than 16% given a random mobility pattern.

A major challenge in designing an IoT network is to achieve coexistence between different wireless technologies sharing the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum. Although there is significant literature on coexistence between IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11, the coexistence of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with other technologies remains understudied. In this work, we examine coexistence between IEEE 802.15.4, BLE and IEEE 802.11, which are widely used in residential and industrial wireless applications. We perform a mathematical analysis of the effect of cross technology interference on the reliability of the affected wireless network in the physical (PHY) layer. We also set up and perform PHY layer experiments to verify the analytical results. Finally, we extend the study to the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Our findings show that, even though the MAC layer mechanisms of IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE improve reliability, cooperative solutions are required to achieve coexistence.

A snapshot time-to-digital converter (TDC) acts as a digital subsampler featuring an increased out-of-range gain and without any assistance from the traditional counting of DCO edges, thus further reducing power consumption. With a proposed DCO-divider phase rotation in the feedback path, the impact of the digital-to-time converter's (DTC's) non-linearity on the PLL is reduced and improves fractional spurs by at least 8 dB across BLE channels. Moreover, a "variable-preconditioned LMS" calibration algorithm is introduced to dynamically correct the DTC gain error with fractional frequency control word (FCW) down to 1/16384. Fabricated in 40 nm CMOS, the SS-DPLL achieves phase noise performance of -109 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, while consuming a record-low power of 1.19 mW.

In this paper, an 89-mm-long robotic fish is designed and built, which is capable of swimming fast and turning flexibly. This miniature robotic fish is intended to be used as a tool for animal behavioral research and special underwater missions. Compared with traditional design, the propulsion system is characterized by no motor, which is a magnetic actuator. Bluetooth low energy is utilized for remote control, allowing convenient operation via smart devices. By means of law of electromagnetic induction, the relationship between current and magnetic induction intensity is explored. Further, a novel tail-beat rhythm for magnetic actuator is proposed. Meanwhile, a dynamic modeling of fishlike swimming is constructed based on a Lagrange approach to analyze its propulsive performance. Finally, aquatic experiments verify the effectiveness of the formulated magnetically actuated design scheme along with the conducted theoretical analyses.

The measured Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values, which are available in Bluetooth systems anyway, are used for localization. It is well-known that localization based on RSSI measurements can only be achieved with a limited accuracy when applying these values directly to respective path loss models. Therefore additional signal processing is performed on the RSSI values and an auto-calibration approach is proposed, which takes inconsistencies with respect to environmental textures into account. The respective model parameters can be thus matched and updated in regular intervals. Further improvements are obtained by performing distance estimation in both directions, namely from transmitter to receiver and vice versa. Furthermore a sophisticated post processing of the RSSI values is performed. Compared to established RSSI-based localization methods based on low-power, low-cost systems, the localization accuracy has been significantly improved by applying the proposed methods. This is verified by measurements using an experimental setup.

There is a growing demand for wearable technologies with continuous and minimally intrusive physiological parameter monitoring capabilities. Continuous respiratory rate monitoring using a three-axis accelerometer from the sternum or abdomen is highly challenging due to motion corruption and presents a potential area of research. A system design for continuous and long term respiratory rate monitoring, in a wearable form factor with capability of remote monitoring is presented in this paper. The device runs on a low power ARM Cortex MO microcontroller and uses in built BLE (Bluetooth Low energy) module for wireless connectivity. A respiratory rate computation algorithm using motion artifact rejection is implemented on the device for reliable performance. Respiratory rate computation by the device was validated in a controlled setting, against gas pressure sensor on 20 subjects. The system architecture, device design, algorithm implementation and experimental validation of the proposed modality are presented.	[Preejith, S.

However, a traditional wearable device may be inconvenient to carry. Therefore, the size of low power ICs and wireless modules in this device need to be minimized for healthcare system. In this paper, we proposed non-contact and low power sensors with integrated kinetic sensor for multiparameter real time monitoring. The proposed system consists of a non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor with fully integrated analog front end (AFE), a temperature sensor, an accelerometer, and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module. The system is small with the size of 50.5 x 15.2 x 6mm. The developed wearable glass in the system can be used by inpatient, outpatient or people with disability. The device could also be used by aging people who live alone, capable of sensing fall detection, temperature and monitoring ECG. An Android application is developed to perform data processing, and it also sends alerts to authorities in case of emergency.

For stroke rehabilitation, 24-hour monitoring is recommended. Low-power wireless such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is suitable for this purpose because of its long battery life. However, most systems require smartphones or tablet computers to acquire patient data due to BLE's short communication range. Instead of using smartphones, we installed around fifty BLE gateways to implement a hands-free data acquisition system. The system was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The data acquisition rate of the system was found to be over 90% through 24-hour patient monitoring, which is almost the same as that for systems using smartphones. Questionnaires about usability administered to both medical staff and patients suggested that they felt the smartphone-less system was more comfortable than the smartphone system. These results suggest the possibility of using such a distributed data acquisition system in real medical wards and its benefits.

Manufacturers are cooperators who can continue to share realistic data about inventories and logistics with colleges, and colleges can improve the inventory and logistics curriculum training based on these realistic data. The system involved three parts, including the tag of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology, a smartphone APP as a reader, and a cloud database. When the tag is installed on a shelf of a warehouse or logistics facility, it can continue to actively collect all of the changing data about inventories and logistics and feed it back to the cloud database. The system focuses on active data feedback. Therefore, it is impossible to cause a heavy loading on manufacturers. When students access the cloud database, they can use these real data to learn how establish a fit inventory management approach and logistics decision. Thus, the system could help colleges to train students on practical abilities in inventory and logistics curriculum. Therefore, the system could improve the lack of existing inventory and logistics curriculum training.

To alleviate this problem different data collection approaches have been proposed. One of the promising techniques is to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In spite of several papers advocating this approach, there have been no system designs and associated performance evaluation proposed to date. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new WSN design, where UAV serves as a sink while Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is used as a communication technology. We analyze the proposed design in terms of the network lifetime and area coverage comparing it with routed WSNs. Our results reveal that the lifetime of the proposed design is approximately two orders of magnitude longer than that of the routed WSNs. Using the tools of integral geometry we show that the density of nodes to cover a certain area is approximately two times more for routed WSNs compared to our design.

Successful stress management depends on the effective monitoring of people's everyday activities, in particular, their sedentary behaviors. Here, we propose an unobtrusive office sedentary behavior monitoring system that combines Bluetooth signals and ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals to classify an individual's sitting modes into four categories: off-seat, sedate, working, and in-motion. The proposed monitoring system simultaneously reads received signal strength indicators (RSSI) from several fixed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and BCG data from the piezoelectric sensor placed underneath the chair cushion, with distinct sampling frequencies. The raw signals are first denoised with local subspace projection. Then we extract the local spectral features from the reconstructed signal and the signal differences for a two-stage stacking learning algorithm. The temporally classified results establish a desk-based worker's sedentary profile and make possible the timely intervention of physical inactivity. We tested the prototype system for 15 subjects, and the preliminary results achieved 95% accuracy, demonstrating its potential in a real-world application.

This task is challenging, as today's IoT systems often consist of heterogeneous wireless devices using incompatible technologies. Because of this, existing solutions often make use of multi-radio gateways, which allow an indirect synchronization across heterogeneous devices, but increase end-to-end delays and suffer from an increased overhead. In this work, we present X-Sync, a novel approach allowing a direct and bidirectional clock synchronization among off-the-shelf wireless IoT devices with incompatible physical layer. X-Sync leverages cross-technology communication to convey timing information among heterogeneous devices and presents novel techniques to compensate for the inaccuracies in reliably detecting the start of a cross-technology frame. We seamlessly integrate X-Sync into the Contiki-NG operating system and evaluate its performance experimentally on off-the-shelf Bluetooth Low Energy and IEEE 802.15.4 devices, showing that X-Sync achieves a mu s-level synchronization accuracy.

An integrated Radio-Frequency Input-Output (RFIO) circuitry embedded with transmitter/receiver (TX/RX) switch function and on- chip impedance matching is proposed. A hybrid-loop TRX structure based on a wide-bandwidth fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) is implemented to achieve the maximum power reduction. A -94dBm receiver sensitivity is achieved with 2.3mW receiver power consumption, while a RF receiving bypass route integration enhances the input power tolerance. The BLE transceiver delivers -6dBm output power while consuming 2.6mW and delivers 0dBm output power while achieving 18.5% maximum TX efficiency. Thanks to the RFIO with harmonic suppression, -56dBc of 2nd-order harmonic distortion (HD2) and -48dBc of 3rd-order harmonic distortion (HD3) suppression are achieved with 0.85mm(2) on-chip area. This transceiver satisfied the BLE radio specification without the need for external filters and with low-power consumption, which enables minimum size and long life-time modules.

While today's smartphone users frequently use WiFi on the move, smartphone does not perform WiFi handoff to nearby access points (APs) even if signal quality is severely degraded. Such undesired operation of smartphone is known as sticky client problem. In this work, we focus on resolving sticky client problem through fast WiFi handoff. First, we analyze the causes of sticky client problem based on experiments with commercial Android smartphones by focusing on WiFi scanning and handoff operations. Note that smartphones and state-of-the-art APs are equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), we propose a practical solution, called BLEND, utilizing BLE to enable fast WiFi handoff. Smartphone acquires information about nearby APs through BLE advertising packet sent by APs, and then judiciously performs WiFi handoff. We implement BLEND on Android smartphones and demonstrate that BLEND achieves up to 61% and 111% higher throughput and video bitrate, respectively, compared with a commercial Android application. We also validate that BLEND operates on smartphone with negligible energy overhead.

Limited by technical features, the traditional scatternet formation technology has not been widely used in real commercial chipsets. As new features are introduced into the Bluetooth core field, the ability to use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to construct a network becomes the reality and puts forward new challenges. The scatternet formation technology facing to BLE and wearable devices requires significant improvement in energy efficiency. According to our experiments, 92% of the system energy consumption can be attributed to central nodes. In this paper, we presented a Bluetooth scatternet formation technology focused on energy efficiency, GreenLink, which minimizes the amount of central nodes by enhancing system aggregation degree to ensure excellent energy-saving performance. Meanwhile, we implemented a prototype of GreenLink on Nordic nRF51822 chipsets, conducted experiments, and verified in practice. According to the experiments, GreenLink used only 30% central nodes and reduced 50% system energy consumption compared with traditional technology.

Since BLE4.0 is highly sensitive to fast fading impairments, numerous ongoing studies are currently exploring the use of supervised learning algorithm as an alternative approach to exploit the information provided by the indoor radio maps. Despite the large number of results reported in the literature, there are still many open issues on the performance evaluation of such approach. In this paper, we start by identifying, in a simple setup, the main system parameters to be taken into account on the design of BLE4.0 beacons-based indoor localization mechanisms. In order to shed some light on the evaluation process using supervised learning algorithm, we carry out an in-depth experimental evaluation in terms of the mean localization error, local prediction accuracy, and global prediction accuracy. Based on our results, we argue that, in order to fully assess the capabilities of supervised learning algorithms, it is necessary to include all the three metrics.

Most of these applications require a positioning mechanism to detect the position of both people and objects. While BLE is a key enabling technology, it is relatively new as compared to Wi-Fi and RFID. Hence there is a need to conduct more studies on BLE-based positioning methods. In general, positioning methods based on signal propagation and fingerprint are commonly used in wireless networking. These methods have their own limitations in terms of practical use and ease of implementation. In this paper, we present an innovative BLE-based positioning methodology called BluePrint which makes use of a detection mechanism called NUFO (Near, Uncertain, Far and Out). It combines a simple fingerprint-like method with a rule-based algorithm to estimate positions. Experimental results show that Blueprint with NUFO detection can achieve good performance as compared to other methods. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical.

BLE is a well-known technology for the low-power connectivity suitable for IoT devices and also for the proximity with the range of several meters. Apple has already adopted the technic and enhanced it to provide subdivided proximity range levels. But as it is also a variation of RSS-based distance estimation, iBeacon could only provide immediate, near or far status but not a real and accurate distance. To provide the distance using BLE, this paper introduces additional self-correcting beacon to calibrate the reference distance and mitigate errors from environmental factors. By adopting self-correcting beacon while measuring the distance, the average distance error showed less than 10% within the range of 1.5 meters. Some considerations are presented to extend the range to be able to get accurate distances. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recent research advances demonstrated the applicability of A-mode US for blood flow monitoring, prostheses control, and muscle activity classification. However, despite the growing interest and progress in wearable US, existing commercial and academic research platforms do not yet offer all the key functionalities and performance metrics for wearable, configurable continuous monitoring of physiological parameters, at the same time offering access to raw data (to sustain the development of novel machine learning approaches on heterogeneous US applications).

The proposed intra-oral device is based on tailored-made capacitive flexible force sensors. Measured data are collected and transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a custom-made iOS application. The proposed fabrication process offers a custom-fit device made of materials and components commonly used in dentistry, ensuring biocompatibility. A preliminary device evaluation shows positive results in terms of battery duration and quality of the measured data also after its immersion in water. The 50-mAh battery allows the proposed system to be used for multiple rehabilitation sessions before recharging it. The non-linear behavior and the hysteresis of the capacitive sensors allow to detect five levels from 0 N to 1.11 N of applied force against the palate.

Relacks: Reliable Backscatter Communication in Indoor Environments	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON INTERACTIVE MOBILE WEARABLE AND UBIQUITOUS TECHNOLOGIES-IMWUT			English	Article						Internet of Things; Backscatter communication; Reliability; Bluetooth; Indoor; Diversity		The increasing number of embedded, plugged-in radios around homes and offices in everyday objects such as appliances, TVs, and smart speakers provides an excellent opportunity to bring ultra-low-power backscatter connectivity to billions of devices. However, backscatter links suffer from high loss due to two consecutive propagations and have to operate on narrow link-budget margins, which makes them more susceptible to multipath losses in indoor environments. To address this, we propose a closed-loop backscatter system that exploits diversity sources such as communication frequency and transceivers antennas based on the channel metrics to deliver reliable coverage over an entire area. We prototype a backscatter system with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceivers and BLE compatible tags and deploy it in several multipath rich indoor environments. Our evaluations show that we can successfully communicate with a backscatter tag in a 50m(2) indoor area. The proposed algorithm for selecting communication parameters achieves an average 2.7 x success rate compared to the random selection while satisfying FCC output power requirements for frequency hopping transceivers.

In order to facilitate this process, objective feedback is paramount. This led to the idea of developing a force-measurement and -monitoring system. The newly developed system consists of a wireless device with a force sensor and an app that is running on standard smartphones. The device records the force applied to the sensor and transmits it via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the app. There it is visualised as a graph and can be evaluated. The system allows us to provide all students with a tool to develop their manual skills, and especially their thrusting technique. As the feedback given by the system can be recorded, progress can be monitored and students can be mentored accurately according to their strengths and weaknesses.

This creates a large amount of data with location references, having an influence on the employees privacy - especially if personal references to employees are possible. To investigate this topic, a use case was carried out in an industrial environment. Therefore, a self-developed asset tracking (AT) system was developed and compared with a Commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) AT-System with regard to functionality and employee privacy. One mayor finding was that the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based legacy system has weaknesses with regard to privacy, e.g. the advertising-data of mobile devices of the employees were stored in the cloud application of the system provider. This data can be used to determine the position of employees. With the self-developed system these weaknesses were avoided by using a Privacy by Design (PbD) approach. Therefore, this paper focuses on employee privacy in industrial AT applications and provides a PbD concept for wireless sensor networks in industrial environments.

Consequently, blindness in children affects the development of their spatial abilities. Here we present ABBI (Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction), a wearable device that was developed to rehabilitate underdeveloped skills in visually impaired children. The core idea behind ABBI is to use the auditory modality to convey spatial information about the movement of the person's own body within the personal, peri-personal and extra-personal space. Specifically, it provides sources of sounds positioned on the main effectors/limbs (such as the wrists and feet) of persons with visual deficits. The ABBI system is composed of a small wearable custom-designed device with integrated audio system, motion sensors, and a Bluetooth low energy module to communicate with a smartphone. We discuss the importance of this device in terms of innovation, usability and highlight future studies aimed at rehabilitating the brain processes and functions involved in spatial cognition of children with visual disabilities through natural audio-motor associations.

The proposed system was evaluated in two user studies, both on text input: (1) users learning curve in terms of writing speed; (2) rate of text entry comparison between the proposed interface and that of numpad style keyboards. We associated each keystroke to a set of letters/symbols and compared two approaches: one based on T9 technique and the other on multi-tap input method. Results show comparable performance between HAT and numpad style keyboards. HAT keeps the hands free, not affecting hand movements and human interactions with the surroundings. Moreover, as a general input technology, it might have several potential applications in the field of computer-human interfaces.

In this scheme, hardware like location tracking devices such as GPS, WiFi positioning system, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and RFID is not required. Instead, the proposed system entirely relies on the existing data in the Hospital Information System (HIS). The data analytics are conducted associated with the preset rules and conditions throughout the system operation, resulting in the generation of the suggestion information for the patients. This scheme does not involve an interaction between patients or any users and readers or sensors. Instead, the scheme completely pushes all information to the patients in a passive way, as opposed to existing approaches that the patients must interact with readers or sensors to determine the location. The proposed method in this paper gives a major impact for hospitals by creating information values out of existing hospital data where was previously invisible to the patients, but is now valuable to them.

We develop a technique for estimating regions of wireless coexistence (RWC) - the transmission configurations of each of the wireless systems which permit coexistence - based on measurements of key performance indicators (KPIs) of those systems. In this article we focus on two-way coexistence tests, which aim to determine the impact each of the communications systems have on each other. The new technique is based on a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown transmission-configuration-to-KPI functions. We introduce a sequential design of experiments based on this surrogate model which is designed to reduce the number of measurements necessary to reach a highly-accurate estimate of a RWC. On an illustrative example, this technique reduces the average number of required measurements by over 40% compared to a baseline experimental design. Similar results are achieved for a measurement-informed simulation based on a coexistence test between an Bluetooth Low Energy device and an IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi devices.

Various wildfire monitoring systems are deployed in different countries, most depend on photos or videos to identify features of wildfire after the first outbreak, while the delay of confirmation varies with technology. An autonomous forest wildfire early warning system is presented in this paper, which employs a state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fly around a forest regularly according to established routes and strict procedures, to collect environmental data from sensors installed on trees, to monitor and predict wildfire, then provide early warning before eruption if a danger emerges. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is employed to exchange data between UAV and the host of sensors. The collected monitoring data, such as temperature and humidity, is effective to reflect the real condition of the forest, which could result in early warning of wildfires. The application of this system in the environment will enhance the ability of wildfire prediction for the community.

"Wireless Metal Insulator Transition (MIT) Fire Alarm System" can dramatically lower power consumption by using a Critical Temperature Switch (CTS) as a sensing device. The CTS, playing a key role in fire detection module, is a heat sensor made of Vanadium dioxide (VO2). When the CTS has high resistance in room temperature, a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) maintains shutdown mode. In the shutdown mode, the MCU doesn't work with any of its other function including an Analog Digital Convertor and only the CTS works to monitor. As the CTS changes into low resistance in case of fire breakout, the CTS operates the MCU to make an alarm and wireless communication. Bluetooth Low Energy beacons are also applied to wireless communication module and can be monitored by supervisor from the web server.

The ubiquity of mobile devices make them ideal platforms for these games to promote physical activities. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons can be utilised for proximity detection to promote physical activities and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of object recognition can accelerate engagement with location-based pervasive games. Therefore, we have designed, implemented, and tested a casual exergame in the form of a treasure hunt that provides the approximate location of nearby points of interest in real-time within the vicinity of Bluetooth beacons. The system exploits the signal strength of the BLE beacons to measure proximity which makes it suitable for outdoor and indoor functioning where GPS signals are not accessible. Our preliminary results show that IoT technology can be successfully utilised for proximity detection with sufficient accuracy. In addition the adoption of AI and Camera challenges has offered an active gaming experience and mediated playful experiences for large spaces.

Among the potential users are people with diabetes, a large part of the population for which monitoring foot pressure and temperature is critical to avoid ulceration, and even amputation. Despite all these reasons the use of foot monitoring devices is still uncommon compared to other accessories such as fitness tracking devices. This work describes the development of an instrumented insole for monitoring pressure, temperature and humidity taking advantage of widely available wearable components. This is made possible by additionally developing a shield board for time-division multiplexing of the pressure signals and an embedded user interface which is stored in the microcontroller's memory and uploaded to a smartphone at start-up via Bluetooth Low Energy. The user interface runs on a smartphone to provide both real time monitoring and averages of sensor data. The system is described in detail and validated by monitoring pressure patterns during stance, by testing response to temperature variations and observing patterns in individuals with pes planus posture.

However, few currently available techniques support the assessment of desired behavioral improvement during learning. In this paper, we describe recently developed wearable smart glasses instrumented with mechatronic sensors and controllers. The mechatronics glasses, worn by both an instructor and a child, quantitatively measure the eye contact behavior of the child. The instructor glasses connect with a smartphone application through Bluetooth low energy. A user interface is created and hosted on the smartphone to enable the instructor to customize the reward to the child based on improvements in eye contact behavior. Specifically, the smartphone application quantifies the eye contact duration, frequency, latency, and session time, allowing instructors, therapists, and clinicians to monitor and track the child's progress in eye contact behavior. The results from preliminary user testing of the device with control subjects show that the device is capable of recording sessions details and supporting eye contact behavior assessment.

Compared to classic Bluetooth, BLE has been simplified in many ways that include its connection establishment, data exchange, and encryption processes. Unfortunately, this simplification comes at a cost. For example, only a star topology is supported in BLE environments and a peripheral (an IoT device) can communicate with only one gateway (e.g. a smartphone, or a BLE hub) at a set time. When a peripheral goes out of range, it loses connectivity to a gateway, and cannot connect and seamlessly communicate with another gateway without user interventions. In other words, BLE connections do not get automatically migrated or handed-off to another gateway. In this paper, we propose a system which brings seamless connectivity to BLE-capable mobile IoT devices in an environment that consists of a network of gateways. Our framework ensures that unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf BLE devices seamlessly and securely connect to a nearby gateway without any user intervention.

Achieving this design point requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a new method of acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of current measurement; an efficient and accurate method of computing power from the voltage and current channels; a radio interface that leverages nearby smart phones to display data and report it to the cloud; and a retro power supply reimagined with vastly lower current draw, allowing extreme miniaturization. PowerBlade occupies a mere 1 '' by 1 '' footprint, offers a 1/16 '' profile, draws 176 mW continuously, offers 1.13% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200 W range and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs $11 in modest quantities of about 1000 units. This new design point enables affordable large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage-an area of growing national importance.

However, it doesn't work well in indoor environments because it requires the line of sight to the satellites and therefore stops working when the line of sight is not available. High-precision indoor localization is critical to many personal and business applications. After Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), an energy-efficient version of Bluetooth, is widely deployed, Bluetooth-based indoor localization turns out to be a practical method to locate Bluetooth-enabled devices due to its low battery cost. In this paper, we present two novel BLE-based localization schemes, Low-precision Indoor Localization (LIL) and High-precision Indoor Localization (HIL). Different than most of the existing localization methods that attempt to find the specific location of the object under investigation, LIL and HIL utilize the collected RSSI measurements to generate a small region in which the object is guaranteed to be found. Compared with LIL, HIL leads to smaller localization regions. However, HIL requires an extra data-training phase.

Following this concept, a novel many-to-many authentication scheme based on passive NFC tags is proposed. In contradiction to existing solutions that assume a wireless key to be a battery-powered device with considerable computational power, we suggest to use a passive NFC tag in order to minimise the key size and significantly reduce the costs. The security of all the information on the tag is guaranteed by a specific data encryption scheme constructed on top of strong cryptographic primitives. In our approach, all the computations are performed by the service user is authenticating in, and thus no computational power and no battery on the key side is needed. This comes to an user-friendly, secure and cost-efficient solution. Moreover, the system core - proposed encryption scheme could be easily applied to any other carrier technologies, as, for example, to Bluetooth Low Energy or Wireless USB. Having generalised our solution to hold an integrity property, it can also be used for another emerging application - secure documents storage.

We present an opensource, general method for detecting maliciously deployed BLE trackers. Our algorithm detects malicious devices in just a few minutes, whereas previous algorithms take hours or days. We show in a small but novel validation study that our algorithm performs with high precision and recall for most extant trackers, although AirTags pose additional challenges. Along with our algorithm and validation, we provide an open-source Android application capable of real-time detection of these devices. We also characterize the behavior of the AirTag and discuss the risk factors which make it particularly hard to detect. We conclude with a discussion for future work to make tracking devices safer for the public.

However, the existing indoor positioning systems are still suffering from several issues, such as unstable positioning accuracy, a high system complexity, and a high deployment cost. To tackle these issues, this article presents a Particle Filter-based Indoor Positioning System (PFIPS) that can localize and track a tag that broadcasts Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon messages to BLE receivers. The proposed PFIPS uses a Kalman Filter to preprocess collected Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) information in order to smooth the fluctuated RSSI data. It also designs an effective Particle Filter (PF) to approximate the location of a tag, which gradually reduces the location uncertainties in a Gaussian belief space. To show the applicability of our PFIPS, we have developed PFIPS in a testbed based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. Through intensive simulations and experiments, our experiment results show that our PFIPS outperforms the legacy indoor positioning systems in terms of location accuracy by 24.1% and achieves median accuracy of 1.16 m.

Our method is based on local estimation, through statistical filtering of RSSI measurements (Extended Kalman Filter), of the proximity between the beacons that delimit the different areas and the one in the lifeline, followed by a finite state machine risk status detector. Experiments have been performed in a real construction work-place with a wearable device; their results show that our solution is ideal for dynamic construction environments. Its main advantages are robustness of the detection system, easy relocation of the beacons as the construction zone evolves, and no need for calibration, communication infrastructure, external processing support, or configuration/map updates. Additionally, optional remote loT for online monitoring is possible. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One use case is the telemonitoring of blood glucose concentrations from type 2 diabetes patients. Since multiple blood glucose meters for the consumer market exist and health professionals operate different information systems standardized communication interfaces are needed. Specifications for those interfaces are available from the Personal Connected Health Alliance. This work introduces an Android application that is able to communicate with blood glucose monitor devices over Bluetooth Low Energy and forward the received and stored blood glucose readings in form of a HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) document. The created CDA document conforms to HL7 and IHE specifications and is send encrypted and digitally signed via email according to IHE XDM requirements. It could be shown, that the requirements from different standard defining organizations can be implemented in an Android application using stock Android features.

One of the main reasons is that a campus' local network is uncovered by public search engines, and most of the local Web sites in a community operate like information silos. A secondary reason is that the daily activities in a local community are highly dynamic; people might be annoyed by the non-correlated information or they just ignore all of it, regardless of importance. In this paper, the proposed campus digital signage aims at connecting local users to correlated information as the user passes by. To this end, we build the server side with two components; one is the information collector that will automatically pull the campus information from other sites, and the other is the information poster to allow qualified users to post content. We also design a wearable client side with a BLE (Bluetooth low energy) proximity sensor to recognize approaching user's identity and dynamically push their correlated information to the digital signage display.

The proposed back-channel communication enables ultra-low power (ULP) devices that are neither WiFi (IEEE 802.11a/g/n) nor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) compliant to receive messages from both WiFi and BLE transmitters. This allows communication between heterogeneous devices beyond the boundary of WiFi and BLE standards without hardware modification on already-deployed infrastructure. Back-channel messages are created in frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation format by feeding carefully crafted bit sequences in the payload of the WiFi or BLE packets. Systematic algorithms are introduced to embed any desired back-channel messages in FSK format on WiFi and/or BLE compliant packets. Using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) narrowband FSK receiver, we demonstrate successful reception of back-channel messages from WiFi and BLE transmitters. Although this COTS narrowband FSK receiver is not specifically designed for the back-channel communication, less than 1% packet error rate (PER) is achieved, validating the concept of software defined back-channel communication among heterogeneous wireless devices.

Two methods of quantization are proposed in this paper: uniform and non-uniform. Reconstruction is performed using a dictionary based on the Mexican Hat wavelet. A distortion-based performance metric Percent Root-mean-squared Difference (PRD) will be monitored at various Compression Ratios (CR) to quantify the impact of quantization. The energy cost of transmission is also evaluated for different levels of quantization and compared, at certain PRD levels. The results demonstrate that non-uniform quantization outperforms the uniform approach and that employing non-uniform quantization improves implementation efficiency for applications with acceptable PRDs above 6.75%. Results show that utilizing non-uniform quantization can increase the CR from 9.8 to 14.1 for a PRD of 30%. Furthermore, this amounts to a 28.91% reduction in wireless transmission per frame from 37.7 mu J to 26.8 mu J considering Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a target wireless communication protocol.

This paper addresses three essential aspects in attaining secure association for such devices. First, we define a user-interface primitive, oblivious comparison, that allows users to approve authentic associations and abort compromised ones. This distills and generalizes several existing approve/abort mechanisms, and moreover we experimentally show that OC can be implemented using very little hardware: one LED and one switch. Second, we provide a new Message Recognition Protocol (MRP) that allows devices associated using oblivious comparison to exchange authenticated messages without the use of public-key cryptography (which exceeds the capabilities of many IoT devices). This protocol improves upon previously proposed MRPs in several respects. Third, we propose a robust definition of security for MRPs that is based on universal composability, and show that our MRP protocol satisfies this definition.

This measurement system solves the problem of monitoring older people and measuring their activities in multi-resident scenarios. Metrics are defined to analyze and interpret the collected data to understand daily habits and measure the activity level (AL) of older people. The accuracy of the system in detecting movements and discriminating residents is measured. As the sensor-to-person distance increases, the system decreases its ability to detect small movements, while still being able to detect large ones. The accuracy in discriminating the identity of residents can be improved by up to 96% using the Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The effectiveness of the measurement system is demonstrated in a real multi-resident scenario where two older people are monitored during their daily life. The collected data are processed, obtaining the AL and habits of the older people to assess their behavior.

J	Ramadhan, H; Yustiawan, Y; Kwon, J				Ramadhan, Hani; Yustiawan, Yoga; Kwon, Joonho			Applying Movement Constraints to BLE RSSI-Based Indoor Positioning for Extracting Valid Semantic Trajectories	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor positioning; BLE RSSI data; internet of things; semantic trajectory		Indoor positioning techniques, owing to received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based sensors, can provide useful trajectory-based services. These services include user movement analytics, next-to-visit recommendation, and hotspot detection. However, the value of RSSI is often disturbed due to obstacles in indoor environment, such as doors, walls, and furnitures. Therefore, many indoor positioning techniques still extract an invalid trajectory from the disturbed RSSI. An invalid trajectory contains distant or impossible consecutive positions within a short time, which is unlikely in a real-world scenario. In this study, we enhanced indoor positioning techniques with movement constraints on BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) RSSI data to prevent an invalid semantic indoor trajectory. The movement constraints ensure that a predicted semantic position cannot be far apart from the previous position. Furthermore, we can extend any indoor positioning technique using these movement constraints. We conducted comprehensive experimental studies on real BLE RSSI datasets from various indoor environment scenarios. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach effectively extracts valid indoor semantic trajectories from the RSSI data.

It allows low-power, star networks to be set up between a BLE gateway and multiple, power-constrained BLE devices. However, these networks tend to be static, not supporting BLE devices that can freely move around in an environment of multiple interconnected BLE gateways and perform handovers whenever necessary. This work proposes two alternative network architectures for mobile BLE peripherals. One leverages on IPv6 over BLE, whereas the other combines default BLE mechanisms with an additional custom controller. On top, we study in detail the handover mechanism that must be present in both architectures and compare the performance of both a passive and active handover approach. The passive handover approach can be set up without any extra implementation, but an active handover approach offers more proactive handover decisions and can provide a much lower handover latency. All proposed solutions have been implemented and validated on real hardware, showing the feasibility of having future infrastructures with support for mobile BLE devices.

UTI is easily treatable using antibiotics if identified in early stage. However, without early identification and treatment, UTI can be a major source of serious complications in geriatric patients, in particular, those suffering from neurodegen-erative diseases. Also, for infants who have difficulty in describing their symptoms, UTI may lead to serious development of the disease making early identification of UTI crucial. In this paper, we present a diaper-embedded, wireless, self-powered, and autonomous UTI monitoring sensor module that allows an early detection of UTI with minimal effort. The sensor module consists of a paper-based colorimetric nitrite sensor, urine-activated batteries, a boost dc-dc converter, a low-power sensor interface utilizing pulse width modulation, and a Bluetooth low energy module for wireless transmission. Experimental results show a better detection of nitrite, a surrogate of UTI, than that of conventional dipstick testing. The proposed sensor module achieves a sensitivity of 1.35 ms/(mg/L) and a detection limit of 4 mg/L for nitrite.

Capacitive Detection of Filling Levels in a Cup	2016 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE BODY SENSOR NETWORKS (BSN)	International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)	JUN 14-17, 2016	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMB				This contribution presents a smart cup that uses a capacitive sensor to detect its filling level in order to monitor fluid intake over time. Dehydration is frequently diagnosed in hospitals among the elderly and connected to numerous sequelae and deaths. An automated monitoring system that detects daily fluid intake of a patient could reduce the vulnerability to dehydration and therefore the vast expenses that are associated with this condition. The smart cup obtains the current filling level from a capacitive sensor consisting of multiple serially arranged discrete electrodes. It is placed on the outside surface of its wall and shielded against external disturbances. Sensor data is processed applying multiple signal filters and error correction methods. Drinking volume of beverages at room temperature is detected accurately and reliably but error rate rises for very cold or hot liquids. The prototype integrates all components in a compact way, is dishwasher-safe and can be charged inductively. Data is transmitted to a base station via Bluetooth Low Energy. This way, a monitoring device is presented which will help preventing dehydration of elderly people.

The 31*45 mm(2) module supports simultaneous acquisition on maximum 8 channels with an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 20.9 at most and a sampling rate of up to 32KSPS each. Also we implement two popular modes of wireless transmission featuring high data rate and low power, namely a transmission rate of 21.3Kbps using Bluetooth low energy (BLE, power consumption 30mW) and 263Kbps using WiFi (723mW). Additionally, two typical wireless sensing applications, floor vibration detection and electrocardiograph (ECG) signal acquisition, are tested to demonstrate the performance of this platform. Results show that the characteristic of this platform can primely satisfy the requirements of these applications featuring high resolution, low power and high-efficient wireless data transmission, which is greatly helpful for exploring-stage experiments in wireless sensing application cases.

The proposed method uses the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values from multiple Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons scattered around interior spaces. The beacon signals were received from the user devices and processed through an RSSI filter and a group of machine learning (ML) models, in an arrangement of one model per detected node. Finally, a multilateration problem was solved using as an input the inferred distances from the advertising nodes and returning the final position approximation. In this work, we first presented the evaluation of different ML models for inferring the distance between the devices and the installed beacons by applying different optimization algorithms. Then, we presented model reduction methods to implement the optimized algorithm on the embedded system by appropriately adapting it to its constraint resources and compared the results, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method.

Among various alternatives for accurate and cost-effective Indoor Positioning System, positioning based on the Magnetic Field has proven popular, as it does not require specialized infrastructure. Related experimental results have demonstrated good positioning accuracy. However, when transitioned to production deployments, these systems exhibit serious drawbacks to make them practical: a) accuracy fluctuates significantly across smartphone models and configurations and b) costly continuous manual fingerprinting of the area is required. The developed Indoor Positioning System Copernicus is a self-learning, adaptive system that is shown to exhibit improved accuracy across different smartphone models. Copernicus leverages a minimal deployment of Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons to infer the trips of users, learn and eventually build tailored Magnetic Maps for every smartphone model for the specific indoor area. In a practical deployment, after each trip execution by the users we can observe an increase in the accuracy of positioning.

The proposed system is designed with commercial off-the-shelf components, and is based on a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) System-on-Chip (SoC) with an integrated antenna and a programmable ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor core able to control the circuit. The optical signal is generated using a compact laser diode (LD) suitable for a wearable headstage. LD produces light in a highly concentrated way considerably improving the LD-optical fiber coupling efficiency. The proposed optogenetic system is shown to provide 120 mW/mm(2) at the fiber tip with a current consumption of 60mA, considerably lower than LED-based systems. The system is remotely controlled by a smartphone app where the user can define optical stimulations patterns settings (optical power, frequency, duty cycle, etc.). It is also powerful enough to be ready to house additional optogenetics functionalities, like electrochemical sensing of the cell response, without significant modifications, thus being the basis of an integrated optogenetic platform.

Mesh protocols on top of BLE are currently emerging and the standard is currently being released. This paper first proposes a detailed measurement based comparison of two mesh approaches that fit within BLE operation: flooding and connection oriented networking. Using metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and power consumption we conclude that the optimal mesh approach depends on the application. It is shown that for a comparable performance in terms of PDR and overhead, flooding can trade a lower end-to-end delay for a higher power consumption when compared to the connected mesh. We then propose an architecture, called Bluetooth Now, that is able to automatically switch the network between the two based on message priority. Our measurement results confirm the reliable delivery of important and urgent data sent using the Bluetooth Now paradigm, while saving battery life when transmitting non-time critical messages.

Furthermore, CMCD PAs can easily use bondwires as the only circuit inductors, a precious feature that Internet-of-Things (IoT) wireless interfaces can exploit. For this reason, we analyze the voltage and current waveforms in CMCD PAs without assuming infinite value feeding inductors (i.e., without choke inductors). It is shown that the current stress on the switching device is significantly higher than in the conventional topology, especially in bondwire-based designs where relatively small feeding inductances are presented. Finally, we propose a design procedure for a given feeding inductance that maximizes energy efficiency while delivering a compact-size solution. A 2.4-GHz PA capable of delivering 19.8 dBm to a 100- $\Omega $ differential load with a power-added-efficiency (PAE) of 58% is presented. Three-dimensional electromagnetic (3-D EM) simulations combined with postlayout simulations were used to evaluate the PA performance in a quad-flat nonlead (QFN)-type package. The circuit is designed in a 0.13- $\mu \text {m}$ process and only occupies a silicon area of 0.025 mm(2).

This inefficient task results in a considerable expenditure of time and money and is highly susceptible to errors. In contrast, the rapid developments in information technology offer a wide range of possibilities, e. g. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) monitoring, cameras and laser scanners, to record and evaluate data in real-time. The construction site can be mirrored by a digital twin, which stores and manages large amounts of raw data in a structured manner. Besides others, various AI-supported processing methods are necessary to generate information and business knowledge from the raw data. The potential to enable fully automated process monitoring from this information is undeniable.

Open-Source Potentiostat for Wireless Electrochemical Detection with Smartphones	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-SITU; SENSORS; BIOSENSORS; PLATFORM; HEALTH; DNA	This paper describes the design and characterization of an open-source "universal wireless electrochemical detector" (UWED). This detector interfaces with a smartphone (or a tablet) using "Bluetooth Low Energy" protocol; the smartphone provides (i) a user interface for receiving the experimental parameters from the user and visualizing the result in real time, and (ii) a proxy for storing, processing, and transmitting the data and experimental protocols. This approach simplifies the design, and decreases both the size and the cost of the hardware; it also makes the UWED adaptable to different types of analyses by simple modification of the software. The UWED can perform the most common electroanalytical techniques of potentiometry, chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and square wave voltammetry, with results closely comparable to benchtop commercial potentiostats. Although the operating ranges of electrical current and voltage of the UWED (+/- 1.5 V, +/- 180 mu A) are more limited than most benchtop commercial potentiostats, its functional range is sufficient for most electrochemical analyses in aqueous solutions. Because the UWED is simple, small in size, assembled from inexpensive components, and completely wireless, it offers new opportunities for the development of affordable diagnostics, sensors, and wearable devices.

In this way, the dynamics of the gait can be assessed objectively, being able to identify alterations and allowing to guide a personalized treatment as well as to evaluate possible disabilities. In this paper, we describe the development of a Medical IoT (MIoT) gait tracking platform. This is an extension of a previous version based on a fully wireless pair of shoe insoles that can measure gait related data directly on the feet. The insoles can measure the plantar pressure by means of a Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR) layer. The orientation and displacement of the stride can be determined using an Magnetic-Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU) integrated into the insole. The platform includes a way to interact with the user via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection with a mobile application, as well as to host the collected data in a cloud database. This solution is designed to be used in both ways, in the clinical facility or at home while performing daily life activities.

We use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value and the in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) components of the received BLE signals at a single time instance to simultaneously estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) at all APs. Through supervised learning on simulated data, various machine learning (ML) architectures are trained to perform AoA estimation using varying subsets of anchor points. In the final stage of the system, the estimated AoA values are fed to a positioning engine which uses the least squares (LS) algorithm to estimate the position of the tag. The proposed architectures are trained and rigorously tested on several simulated room scenarios and are shown to achieve a localization accuracy of 70 cm. Moreover, the proposed systems possess generalization capabilities by being robust to modifications in the room's content or anchors' configuration. Additionally, some of the proposed architectures have the ability to distribute the computational load over the APs.

Although received signal strength (RSS) can be measured easily with commonly available smart devices, the measurements are unreliable, in which general estimation models are not robust to different hardware and settings for real deployed beacon networks. Furthermore, the lack of consideration for object mobility in these models undermines its practicality. Motivated by the above limitations, this article proposes a novel distance classifier, d-Classifier, to classify the distance with a feature vector constructed with features such as hardware type and deployment environment to improve the robustness. Moreover, comprehensive experiments related to mobility are conducted to study the relationship between packet receiving rate and estimation accuracy. Improved performance can be achieved by providing extra mobility information with a list of RSS values during estimation. The proposed classifier is validated with an extensive data set that includes over 200 k data collected from real beacon networks. Overall, our proposed d-Classifier achieves a significant performance gain, > 25% accuracy improvement, over its prior arts.

Performance Analysis of a Probabilistic Local Search Algorithm for Indoor Tracking	COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2017: SMART SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	ASCE International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering (IWCCE)	JUN 25-27, 2017	Univ Washington, Seattle, WA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Comp Div	Univ Washington		CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEM	Many researchers in the construction domain have explored various sensing technologies to acquire location awareness of construction assets. With the use of certain technologies, such as GPS, UWB, and RFID, previous research achieved significant progress for outdoor applications. However, unlike outdoor tracking, indoor environments pose considerable challenges because of the existence of a multitude of interactions among workers, equipment, and materials. These challenges appear in the form of signal interference such as signal degradation, occlusions, obstructions and multipath effects. To overcome signal interference, this study aims to develop and evaluate a probabilistic local search (PLS) algorithm using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This study conducted a site test together with computer simulation to assess the performance of the developed algorithm with respect to accuracy, reliability and robustness. Although the test was conducted in a simple path, noisy data that are generated from the computer simulation reflect the challenges of signal interference, which are expected from occlusions and other objects that potentially introduce signal interference. Based on the test results, the PLS algorithm showed a significant improvement in accuracy, compared with two conventional positioning methods, especially when signal interference exists in the test environment.

An Autonomous IoT-Based Contact Tracing Platform in a COVID-19 Patient Ward	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						COVID-19; Internet of Things; Wireless communication; Medical services; Wireless sensor networks; Hospitals; Radiofrequency identification; Contact tracing; coronavirus disease (COVID-19); healthcare workers (HCWs); infectious diseases; Internet of Things (IoT)	INTERNET; THINGS; ARCHITECTURE; TECHNOLOGY; MOBILITY	Since 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial impact on all community sectors worldwide, particularly the healthcare sector. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of COVID-19 infection due to occupational exposure to infectious patients, visitors, and staff. Contact tracing of close physical interaction is an essential control measure, especially in hospitals, to prevent onward transmission during an outbreak event. In this article, we propose an Internet of Thing-based contact tracing system for subject identification, interaction tracking, and data transmission in hospital wards. The system, based on Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) devices, tracks the duration of interactions between different HCWs, and the time each HCW spends within the patient rooms using additional information from proximity sensors in the hallway or on the door frame of the patient room. The collected data are transferred via long-range (LoRa) wireless technology and further analyzed to inform infection prevention activities. The suggested system's performance is evaluated in a COVID-19 patient ward with both standard and negative pressure isolation rooms, and the current system's capabilities and future research prospects are briefly discussed.

At present, most wearable sensing devices measure only a small number of physical or electrophysiological parameters, but neglect the rich chemical information available from biomarkers in human body fluid. This work developed a multi-parameter monitoring device based on flexible patch, which integrated a variety of sensors, and is capable of continuous, real-time and synchronous monitoring of physiological parameters (e.g. ECG, PPG) and biochemical parameters (e.g. sodium, potassium, glucose in sweat). The flexible patch was designed with an island-bridge structure, making itself miniaturized and stretchable. In addition, an Android application was developed to receive the Bluetooth low energy packets of the monitoring device. And the monitoring device was tested in signal acquisition of all sensors. Finally, on-body experiments were carried out, to successfully verify the function of multi-parameter monitoring. The results show that our multi-parameter monitoring device provided in this work is suitable for sports scenes, which allows the feedback of body status through the comprehensive evaluation of individuals, and has a good application prospect for athletes to monitor physiological load during training.

However, the BLE beacon network usually suffers from high maintenance costs due to the short battery lifetime. A recent work proposed duty-cycling BLE advertising interval subject to the detected existence of a user; if a user is detected, the beacon operates in a shorter advertising interval, otherwise operates in a longer advertising interval to reduce its energy consumption. However, since such reactive approach operates based on hard-coded advertising intervals for the two scenarios, the energy-efficiency is bound to be sub-optimal. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes to predict the user traffic condition thereby adapting the optimal advertising interval based on the predicted user traffic condition. To this end, we introduce a novel neural network architecture that learns partial correlation and leverages attention mechanism to make accurate predictions with minimum prediction lag. The effectiveness of the proposed learning methods is verified by comprehensive simulations.

In this work, the authors aim to enhance the positioning accuracy by proposing signal power ranking (SPR) and solving related optimisation-based deployment problem of beacons using wireless communication and Bluetooth 4.0 Bluetooth low-energy network technologies. The authors first adopt grid-based field to be the proposed deployment field. Second, they convert the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to several levels called SPR. Third, an optimisation-based model for deployment problem of beacons in indoor positioning is proposed on the basis of the above two considerations. The proposed model is to minimise the number of beacons required under some fundamental conditions including full coverage and full discrimination, respectively. Finally, the algorithm of simulated annealing is applied to solve the linear programming problem in this model. By the optimal results, the user can obtain a vector table of RSSI for each location efficiently in the test field. On the other hand, the user in the test field can receive the beacon RSSI value at the same time. In order to determine the user's location, the received beacon RSSI value is compared with the values in the vector table.

The IC is composed of a 3-10 Mb/s quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)/offset QPSK (OQPSK) TRX working at the 400-500 MHz band, and a 1-3 Mb/s Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK)/half sine OQPSK (HS-OQPSK) TRX at the 2.4-2.4835 GHz band for the Bluetooth low energy/IEEE 802.15.4 protocols. The presented combo TRX IC requires one single antenna without any bidirectional RF coupler, to support simultaneous dual-band communication. Two key circuit techniques, namely, the combination biasing technique to suppress the high-order harmonics and the active in-band interference cancellation, are adopted to tackle the crosstalk interference between the two bands during simultaneous dual-band operation. Measurement results show that the in-band interference presented to the 2.4-GHz receiver due to the 400-MHz transmitter is suppressed by 19 dB with the presented design techniques.

Achieving this design point requires revisiting every aspect of conventional power meters: a new method of acquiring voltage; a non-invasive, planar method of current measurement; an efficient and accurate method of computing power from the voltage and current channels; a radio interface that leverages nearby smart phones to display data and report it to the cloud; and a retro power supply re-imagined with vastly lower current draw, allowing extreme miniaturization. PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" x 1" footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws less than 180 mW itself, offers 1.13% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200 W range and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs $11 in modest quantities of about 1,000 units. This new design point enables affordable large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage-an area of growing national importance.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), with low power consumption and low cost, are widely installed in mobile devices, and used for indoor localization. Previous methods usually exploit received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to compute position, and the performance is limited. To further improve positioning accuracy, it is desirable to use angle-of-arrival (AoA) information together. However, a BLE receiver has only one receiving module, and cannot receive signals from multiple antennas simultaneously. To solve this problem, Bluetooth 5.1 added the Constant Tone Extension (CTE) to the end of a BLE packet. Then, it is possible for a BLE receiver to switch the antennas and acquire phase information per antenna successively. In this paper, by adjusting parameters related to CTE, we first investigate how to compute AoA by linear regression. Then, we further discuss how to estimate AoA by exploiting the Multiple Single Classification (MUSIC) method. Experimental results show that linear regression can achieve an AoA error of 5.7 degrees, while using MUSIC helps to reduce this error to 2.3 degrees, which is promising for high accuracy positioning.

The smart helmet worn by pedestrians receives signals transmitted by Bluetooth beacons attached to heavy equipment, light vehicles, or dangerous zones, and provides visual LED warnings to the pedestrians and operators simultaneously. A performance test of the proposed system was conducted in an underground limestone mine. It was confirmed that as the transmission power of the Bluetooth beacon increased, the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signal detection distance of the system also increased. The average BLE signal detection distance was at least 10 m, regardless of the facing angle between the smart helmet and Bluetooth beacon. The subjective workload for the smartphone-, smart glasses-, and smart helmet-based proximity warning system (PWS) was evaluated using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index. All six workload parameters were the lowest when using the smart helmet-based PWS. The smart helmet-based PWS can provide visual proximity warning alerts to both the equipment operator and the pedestrian, and it can be expanded to provide worker health monitoring and hazard awareness functions by adding sensors to the Arduino board.

Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is often utilized in such methods due to availability in most wireless devices. Even in outdoor open space, however, various factors such as path-loss characteristics and antenna directivity possibly cause difficulty in RSSI-based localization. This paper investigates the error factors of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based fingerprinting localization in terms of antenna directivity. Most existing studies have analyzed the error factor in localization algorithms or methods to improve accuracy. On the other hand, the error factors on the environments had not been paid attention yet at all. In this paper, we investigate distance errors of the DNN-based fingerprinting method in terms of antenna directivity as one of the environmental factors using virtual space reproduced in a computer. Through experiments where an actual Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tag system was emulated, we found that the tag antenna directivity could be the factor to worsen the localization accuracy while receiver antenna directivity to better.

The problem with battery-powered beacon is that frequent battery replacement is required. Such a battery replacement process can be very tedious considering the massive amount of already deployed beacons. While solar-powered beacons have emerged as an alternative to the battery-powered beacon, beacon deployment is challenging considering the very low ambient light energy available in indoor environments. This paper presents an innovate solar-powered beacon with an adjustable solar panel. In particular, we employ Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model the angle adjusting problem. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) the MDP formulation is based on the insight obtained from a series of preliminary experiments which unveil the relationship between the incident angle and the harvested power; 2) our experiment shows that the legacy Policy Iteration (PI) and Value Iteration (VI) algorithms achieve similar optimized decision-making by adjusting the angle of solar panels such that to quickly charge up the beacon when it is low in energy. This rapid charging time guarantees the sustainable operation of solar-powered beacons in indoor environments.

In Malaysia, a majority of the households are dual-earner families, leaving their elderly parents at home. Without caretakers to look after them, aging parents may be susceptible to accidents. Therefore, an elderly action recognition system which can automatically identify their actions and whereabouts at home is needed. In this paper, the development and testing of a wearable device with motion detection and indoor positioning based on Random Forest Classifier is presented. The experiment was conducted in a home environment (MMU Digital Home Lab). The action recognition system utilizes a gyroscope and an accelerometer to detect different types of motion which are walking, sitting, standing, sitting-down, standing-up, falling, and sleeping. The action recognition system can measure these motions with a 97.6% accuracy. On the other hand, the indoor positioning uses Bluetooth Low Energy beacon and scanners to pinpoint five locations which are living room, bedroom, kitchen, office and toilet with a 97.25% accuracy. The results from the measured motions and indoor locations are pushed to an online Internet of Things (IoT) platform for action recognition, data logging and analytics.

Current wearable solutions lack either on the wearing comfort, the quality and type of the data provided or the price of the device. This paper shows the development of a Textile Sensor Platform (TSP) in the form of an electrocardiogram (ECG)-measuring T-shirt that is able to transmit the ECG signal to a smartphone. The development process includes the selection of the materials, the design of the textile electrodes taking into consideration their electrical characteristics and ergonomy, the integration of the electrodes on the garment and their connection with the embedded electronic part. The TSP is able to transmit a real-time streaming of the ECG-signal to an Android smartphone through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Initial results show a good electrical quality in the textile electrodes and promising results in the capture and transmission of the ECG-signal. This is still a workin-progress and it is the result of an interdisciplinary master project between the School of Informatics and the School of Textiles & Design of the Reutlingen University.

Using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol, mobile devices such as smartphones and smartwatches continuously transmit beacons to inform passive listeners about device locations for applications such as digital contact tracing for COVID-19, and even finding lost devices. These applications use cryptographic anonymity that limit an adversary's ability to use these beacons to stalk a user. However, attackers can bypass these defenses by fingerprinting the unique physical-layer imperfections in the transmissions of specific devices. We empirically demonstrate that there are several key challenges that can limit an attacker's ability to find a stable physical layer identifier to uniquely identify mobile devices using BLE, including variations in the hardware design of BLE chipsets, transmission power levels, differences in thermal conditions, and limitations of inexpensive radios that can be widely deployed to capture raw physical-layer signals. We evaluated how much each of these factors limits accurate fingerprinting in a large-scale field study of hundreds of uncontrolled BLE devices, revealing that physical-layer identification is a viable, although sometimes unreliable, way for an attacker to track mobile devices.

The paper proposes a work on how drones could be controlled using brainwaves without any of those devices. The drone control system of the current research was developed using electroencephalogram signals took by an Emotiv Insight headset. The electroencephalogram signals are collected from the user's brain. The processed signal is then sent to the computer via Bluetooth. The headset employs Bluetooth Low Energy for wireless transmission. The brain of the user is trained in order to use the generated electroencephalogram data. The final signal is transmitted to Raspberry Pi zero via the MATT messaging protocol. The Raspberry Pi controls the movement of the drone through the incoming signal from the headset. After years, brain control can replace many normal input sources like keyboards, touch screens or other traditional ways, so it enhances interactive experiences and provides new ways for disabled people to engage with their surroundings.

J	Murillo, Y; Reynders, B; Chiumento, A; Pollin, S				Murillo, Yuri; Reynders, Brecht; Chiumento, Alessandro; Pollin, Sofie			A Multiprotocol Low-Cost Automated Testbed for BLE Mesh	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE			English	Article								Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is envisioned as one of the most prominent technologies for the Internet of Things. The recent release of BLE mesh has attracted interest from both the industrial and academic communities, with new proposals for optimizing its performance being published on a regular basis. However, the majority of these publications rely on analysis and simulations, potentially neglecting the effect of real-life environments and hardware limitations. Moreover, no framework is available to experimentally compare the performance of different mesh protocols on top of BLE. This article presents the design and implementation of a low-cost, modular, and fully automated testbed capable of running multiple mesh protocols. It is also remotely accessible for any third party interested in performing network experiments with it. Apart from discussing the testbed architecture, we provide results obtained from a measurement-driven comparison of two protocols that fit within BLE operation: connection-based. These results show that there is a trade-off between the two approaches and that the optimal mesh protocol to use is application-dependent, which should be taken into consideration when heading towars the next release of BLE mesh.

Digital technologies hold a great promise to increase efficiency and use resources effectively. In this paper we present a low-power and scalable IoT-based architecture for home farmers and scientific purposes that enables to verify the environmental impact on plants developments by monitoring the soil moisture and temperature. The measured values are transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a gateway, e.g., a smartphone running the gateway app, to a cloud platform that stores and processes the data. This data is useful to give home farmers vital information, e.g., when to water a plant or when the plant is prune to get infected by a disease. This information is of great importance because it helps to decrease crop failures and thus farm more efficient. The hardware and software architecture presented is scalable and designed to consume low power. Experiments show that it is possible to create a high-spatial resolution by putting many sensor nodes on a small area, in order to help research to measure micro-climate.

Therefore, the identification of specific sedentary behaviors (TV viewing, sitting at work, driving, relaxing, etc.) is especially relevant for planning personalized prevention programs. Objective: To build and evaluate a public a dataset for the automatic recognition (classification) of sedentary behaviors. Results: The dataset included data from 30 subjects, who performed 23 sedentary behaviors while wearing a commercial wearable on the wrist, a smartphone on the hip and another in the thigh. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons were used in order to improve the automatic classification of different sedentary behaviors. The study also compared six well know data mining classification techniques in order to identify the more precise method of solving the classification problem of the 23 defined behaviors. Conclusions: A better classification accuracy was obtained using the Random Forest algorithm and when data were collected from the phone on the hip. Furthermore, the use of beacons as a reference for obtaining the symbolic location of the individual improved the precision of the classification.

Therefore, this paper presents the Smart Hearing Aid Processor (SmartHeaP), a mixed-signal system on chip (SoC) fabricated in 22 nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) with an adaptive body biasing (ABB) unit and a total die size of 7.36 mm(2). The proposed SoC consists of two application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP) architectures: firstly, a Cadence Tensilica Fusion G6 instruction set architecture, extended with custom instructions for audio processing, and secondly, a Cadence Tensilica LX7 for wireless interfacing, e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy. Furthermore, an analog front-end and digital audio interfaces are added. The large local memory of 2 MB and a high-level software environment enables memory-intensive algorithms to be deployed quickly. Typical hearing aid algorithms in a real-time setup are used to evaluate the power consumption of the SoC at different operating frequencies. At 50 MHz, a mean power consumption of less than 2.2 mW was measured, resulting in an efficiency of 34.8 mu W/MHz.

The present research has collected characteristics of gestures and physical movements from users made by other related research in order to study the same interaction within a virtual world. Through this research a smaller number of gestures were created, improving the user learning curve without affecting the usability. The following implementation uses a client-server architecture, composed of 2 Raspberry Pi devices, and a Smartphone acting as a server, the communication between them was achieved by employing Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The immersive virtual experience is accomplished by using Unity 3D and Google VR, tools that allowed the design and display of a playful virtual environment as an approach to promote physical and cognitive skills such as spatial thinking and hand-eye coordination. By performing maneuvers through an aerial circuit filled with obstacles, the proposed UAV simulator encourages motor and mental activity while the user is being entertained. The result is the improvement of the user quality of life by avoiding cognitive and physical sedentarism.

For the IoT connected healthcare applications, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is gaining popularity as wearable devices spring into the market. This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.

Recently, the IoT-based healthcare services are considered as one of the crucial services. However, the existing IoT technology, such as Bluetooth and ISO/IEEE 11073 standard, is not suitable for providing IoT-based healthcare services because it does not support the Internet Protocol (IP). Moreover, the oneM2M standard does not support the IoT-based healthcare services. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of ISO/IEEE 11073-based IoT healthcare services. The proposed architecture can support IP communication using IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. We also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide more efficient communication for constrained devices. For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation. In addition, for evaluation of the associated protocols, we compare the transmission delay between CoAP and HTTP. From the results, we see that CoAP is more efficient than HTTP for the IoT healthcare services.

Wearable devices and ambient devices are also getting popular and can easily access the Internet through smart devices. Although smart devices have incredibly advanced functionalities, their I/O is poor because of their small size. Peripherals are able to compensate for the shortcomings, but currently there is no unified methodology to gather and integrate given devices. We have developed a customizable Web-based system in which services in the Cloud can federate smart devices and peripherals. The proposed system uses Web-based technologies to coordinate between cloud services and the devices at hand. The main benefit is that Web application developers can create an entire system since the configuration and operation of all devices are describable only in Java Script. We have also separated the device functionality from the application logic, thus enabling parallel development. We implemented a prototype system using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and found that it could be easily used to develop a system that emulates a POS terminal. The proposed architecture enables developers to flexibly utilize the Web of Things.

This paper presents the use of flexible capacitive tactile sensing arrays for concurrent monitoring of biopotential and wetness. This has been enabled by designing the cross-section of the capacitive sensor in a specific "H" shape where the movement of the capacitive plates is used for estimating the presence and the value of tactile forces. The capacitive plates act as biopotential sensors when coupled to the skin and the presence of conductive fluids in-between the plates can be sensed through impedance spectroscopy. We have designed a preliminary miniaturized circuit front-end using commercial-of-the-shelf components to interface the sensors and wirelessly transmit the data through a Bluetooth low energy link. Using the designed circuitry, the force applied to the pixel in the array has been estimated through capacitive sensing with a linear change in the capacitance with the applied force. Same sensor was used to detect EKG waveforms and sense the presence of wetness and salinity using impedance characterization.

Here, we present a continuous glucose monitoring platform consisting of a screen-printed electrochemical biosensor and a fully integrated wireless electrochemical analysis system. A biocompatible conjugated polymer (poly (N-phenylglycine)) was employed as the support material for enzyme immobilization. Specifically, a polyurethane outer layer was decorated onto the working electrode of the biosensor to construct a diffusion limiting membrane and improve the linear range of the glucose sensor. We optimized the fabricated glucose sensor so that it achieves a linear range of 1-30 mM and a sensitivity of 12.69 mu A mM(-1).cm(-2) in vitro. The long-term stability is up to 30 days by storing in PBS solution at 4 degrees C. The overall system design was very small (0.8 x 1.8 cm) and consisted of a signal conditioning part, a programmable electrochemical chip, and a wireless connection using Bluetooth Low Energy with a smartphone. Finally, we carried out biocompatibility tests and animal experiments to demonstrate the device can successfully monitor blood glucose in vivo.

Aside from hearing impairment and stress-related illnesses, it can also interfere with spoken communication, reduce human performance and affect the quality of life. As urbanization is intensifying, the potential benefits of reducing noise pollution in smart-city environments are extensive. Noise levels can be collected and analyzed using a wireless sensor network which can monitor the noise level by using microphones. However, every wireless system struggles in terms of the battery requirements needed for continuous data collection and monitoring. In this paper, the design of a testbed for a smart microphone system is presented. To save power, a microcontroller and an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) dynamically switch between high and low power modes in response to environmental noise. Specifically, the high powered components are triggered by a spike in the acoustic noise level. Three wireless technologies, WiFi (2.4 GHz), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 and Zigbee were examined. According to the results, the power consumption of a node can be lowered by 97% when idle based on the testbed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to the Bluetooth standard specifications, the low energy secure simple pairing (LESSP) protocol is the process by which the pairing devices negotiate the authenticated secret key. To violate the user privacy, the adversary can perhaps link the runs of the LESSP protocol to the targeted device, which usually relates to the specially appointed user. Hence, we investigate deep into the privacy of the LESSP protocol. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We demonstrate that the LESSP protocol suffers from privacy vulnerability. That is, an adversary without any secret key is able to identify the targeted device by the LESSP protocol. (2) An improvement is therefore proposed to repair the privacy vulnerability in the LESSP protocol. (3) We develop a formal privacy model to evaluate the privacy vulnerabilities in the LESSP protocol and its improved versions. We further prove that our improvement on the LESSP protocol is private under the privacy model. In addition, the performance evaluation shows that our improvement is as efficient as the LESSP protocol. Our research results are beneficial to the privacy enhancement of Bluetooth systems in wireless personal area networks.

Based on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and geomagnetism, indoor positioning techniques often rely on the physical location of fingerprint information. The focus and difficulty of establishing the fingerprint database are in obtaining a relatively accurate physical location with as little given information as possible. This paper presents a foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) positioning algorithm under the loop closure constraint based on magnetic information. It can provide relatively reliable position information without maps and geomagnetic information and provides a relatively accurate coordinate for the collection of a fingerprint database. In the experiment, the features extracted by the multi-level Fourier transform method proposed in this paper are validated and the validity of loop closure matching is tested with a RANSAC-based method. Moreover, the loop closure detection results show that the cumulative error of the trajectory processed by the graph optimization algorithm is significantly suppressed, presenting a good accuracy. The average error of the trajectory under loop closure constraint is controlled below 2.15 m.

The D-size (55.8 cm(3)) soil energy cell with carbon and zinc electrodes can produce similar to 60-100 mu W, depending on the water contents and microbial reactions in the soil. The RC circuit model of a soil cell is proposed for understanding the electrical characteristics of the cell. The wireless sensing system, including temperature and air moisture sensors, a custom low-power capacitive sensor readout silicon chip, a microcontroller, and a Bluetooth low-energy transmitter, is demonstrated for long-term environmental monitoring solely by the fabricated D-size soil cell. The capacitive sensor readout chip is fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process and only consumes 3 mu W. The capacitance readout range is 160-200 pF. The total power consumption of the wireless temperature and air moisture monitoring system is similar to 20 mu W and 1 mW in the sleep mode and the active wireless data communication operations, respectively. The new technology can enable remote field environment monitoring with less labor-intensive work and battery replacement.

In this context, the Bluetooth technology, despite its widespread adoption in mobile and IoT applications, so far has not received all the attention it deserves. However, the introduction of the Bluetooth direction finding feature and the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to the processing and analysis of the wireless signal for passive human sensing pave the way for novel Bluetooth-based passive human sensing applications, which will leverage Bluetooth Low Energy features, such as low power consumption, noise resilience, wide diffusion, and relatively low deployment cost. This paper provides a reasoned analysis of the data preprocessing and classification techniques proposed in the literature on Bluetooth-based remote passive human sensing, which is supported by a comparison of the reported accuracy results.

While observations of free-ranging animals are a crucial source of information, an experimental investigation that manipulates the size or composition, or both, of animal groups in captivity can also bring complementary contributions to the research inquiry. When paired with an automatic data collection by biologging technology, experimental studies on captive animals also allow for big data analyses based on recent machine learning techniques. As an initial exploration of this research paradigm, the present study inquired to what extent isolation of captive Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) changed their movement patterns. Using threedimensional location trajectories of the macaques that were systematically collected via Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and a deep neural network, we estimated the identifiability of whether a macaque was behaving in isolation or in group. We found that the neural network identified the isolation vs. in-group conditions with more than 90% accuracy from a five-minute location trajectory, suggesting that the isolation caused notable changes from the canonical group-living behaviors. In addition, the isolation made each individual more identifiable from one another based on their location trajectories.

The core idea of CPPCP is to encode a protocol data unit (PDU) with a wide-band pulse train with chaotically-varied inter-pulse intervals. The architecture ensures communication security by introducing randomness between data symbols, noise-like frequency spectrum, and significant energy savings by using a smaller number of pulse transmissions compared to existing secure coding schemes such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Compared with the traditional key-based cryptographic techniques, CPPCP suppresses decipherable information by eliminating symbol periodicity. The mechanism can also be piggy-backed on traditional cryptography solutions to achieve higher levels of security. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the CPPCP implementation in the presence of pulse shape and position fluctuations caused by hardware and channel variabilities. It also presents a detailed analysis of CPPCP's abilities to detect errors without a traditional link layer. Finally, the paper reports a prototype sensor platform and a wide-band pulse transmission channel simulator for demonstrating the efficacy of CPPCP in terms of energy-savings, communication security, and increased data transmission rates.

The goal is to achieve the correct classification of a set of tennis strokes. The system must exhibit robustness to the variability of the height, age or sex of any subject that performs the actions. A new database is developed to meet this objective. The system is based on two sensor nodes using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless technology to communicate with a PC that acts as a central device to collect the information received by the sensors. The data provided by these sensors are processed to calculate their spectrograms. Through the application of innovative deep learning techniques with semi-supervised training, it is possible to carry out the extraction of characteristics and the classification of activities. Preliminary results obtained with a data set of eight players, four women and four men have shown that our approach is able to address the problem of the diversity of human constitutions, weight and sex of different players, providing accuracy greater than 96.5% to recognize the tennis strokes of a new player never seen before by the system.

People receive the services through the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) installed on their mobile phones. However, the positioning and navigation functions of an iBeacon system may be compromised when faced with cyberattacks issued by hackers. In other words, its security needs to be further considered and enhanced. This study took the iBeacon system of Taipei Main Station, the major transportation hub with daily traffic of at least three hundred thousand passengers, as an example for exploring its potential attacks and further studying the defense technologies, with the assistance of AI techniques and human participation. Our experiments demonstrate that in the early stage of iBeacon system information security planning, information security technology and a rolling coding encryption should be included, representing the best defense methods at present. In addition, we believe that the adoption of rolling coding is the most cost-effective defense. However, if the security of critical infrastructure is involved, the most secure defense method should be adopted, namely a predictable and encrypted rolling coding method.

This work designed a portable, multi-vital signs monitoring system, consisting of chest unit and wrist unit, with size of 32 mm x 32 mm and diameter of 30 mm, respectively. The designed system is capable of transmitting measured electrocardiograph (ECG), pulse wave and body temperature signal to the mobile devices wirelessly by Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technique. The heart rate, pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) and respiratory rate are extracted through time domain algorithm. The chest and wrist units can continuously monitor body vital signs for more than 12 and 24 hours, respectively. Besides, the experiment results reveal that the chest unit is able to monitor patients with heart rate abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation and premature beats. The typical heart diseases can be detected in real-time. Meanwhile, the wrist unit clearly detects the changes of the physical parameters of the subjects under different physiological conditions. The accuracy of the designed system is consistent with that of the commercial medical instrument counterpart, with further advantages of compact, portable and patient-friendly natures.

This paper introduces a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon-based system, which can be deployed easily with any off-the-shelf smartphone without modification on the existing infrastructures. However, it is an elusive challenge to achieve a fast item identification and counting involving massive items stacked up inside a confined space (e.g., a container), resulting in an ultra-dense beacon network (UDBN). To this end, we propose a novel beaconing solution capable of informing the receiver about their own presence as well as the presence of their neighboring beacons for identification purpose. Specifically, our proposed solution provides a well-designed yet innovative protocol data unit (PDU) which allows the beacon to encapsulate its neighboring information into its own advertising packet. A prototype consisting of 300 beacons is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed solution for real-world applications. The extensive experiment confirm the superiority of our proposed solution in delivering a fast item identification and counting in UDBN.

Currently available indoor positioning technologies differ in terms of accuracy, costs and effort, but have improved quickly in the last couple of years. It has been actively conducted research for estimating indoor location using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) level of Wi-Fi access points or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tags. WiFi signal is commonly used for the indoor positioning technology. However, It requires an external power source, more setup costs and expensive. BLE is inexpensive, small, have a long battery life and do not require an external energy source. Therefore, using BLE tags we might be able to make the positioning system practical and inexpensive way. In this paper, we investigate such practical type of indoor positioning method based on BLE. BLE RSSI are processed by Multilayer Perceptron(MLP). Also, compass data and walking speed estimation with an extended Kalman filter is used to improve the accuracy. Our preliminary experimental result shows 2.21m error in case of the MLP output. In preliminary experimental results, the proposed approach improved the accuracy of indoor positioning by 21.2%.

J	Sung, JW; Han, SJ				Sung, Jung-Woong; Han, Seung-Jae			Data bundling for energy efficient communication of wearable devices	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Wearable device; Data bundling; Adaptive algorithm; Energy efficiency; Bluetooth	CLOUD	The amount of data that wearable devices send and receive is rapidly increasing and exceeds the capacity of the energy efficient link technologies (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy). High capacity wireless link typically requires high connection setup cost, while wearable devices are intrinsically equipped with small battery. To deal with this dilemma, we propose to aggregate multiple data transmission requests into a single chunk and send the aggregated chunk at once to reduce the energy consumption for connection setup. Where this concept of 'data bundling' has been used for cloud storage services, we apply this concept to wearable devices. Data bundling extends the data delivery delay and therefore it is suitable to the applications that do not require strict real-time delivery. In this paper, we initially focus on reducing the energy consumption and then consider the tradeoff relationship between energy reduction and the penalty caused by the bundling delay. We design three bundling schemes and implement them in a commercial smartwatch which is connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth Classic link. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is experimentally demonstrated and useful insights on the characteristics of bundling are discovered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the wearable devices remain battery powered and therefore restricted to low-power wireless standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Our work tackles the problem of building a reliable autonomous schedule for forwarding this kind of dynamic data in IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH networks. Due to the a priori unpredictability of these data source locations, the quality of the wireless links, and the routing topology of the forwarding network, it is wasteful to reserve the number of slots required for the worst-case scenario; under conditions of high expected datarate, it is downright impossible. The solution we propose is a hybrid approach where dedicated TSCH cells and shared TSCH slots coexist in the same schedule. We show that under realistic assumptions of wireless link diversity, adding shared slots to a TSCH schedule increases the overall packet delivery rate and the fairness of the system.

Two factor authentication schemes such as Google 2 Step verification, SAASPASS, QR code, graphical password and push notification based login schemes can be compromised using RT / CR MITM phishing attacks. Hardware token based schemes are safe but the extra cost of the hardware token makes them unattractive to users. Therefore, there is a need to develop new authentication schemes which are hard for an attacker to compromise but easy for users to understand and utilize. This paper analyzes existing authentication schemes to identify the research gaps and then proposes a secure authentication scheme which uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE, BT 4.0+ version) devices for user identification and which can handle RT/CR MITM phishing attacks, attacks launched via malicious browser extensions and app spoofing via attackers. The proposed scheme is location/client system independent and is secure from Bluetooth address spoofing attacks.

Wireless wearable technologies may hence provide an attractive alternative, but state-of-the-art solutions are generally bulky, include complex electronics, and require a local power source to communicate by using a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) interface. Epidermal battery-less devices enabled by Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology are instead gaining increasing interest. Indeed, data sensing and transmission become fully wireless, and the electronic complexity can be kept small thanks to new generation RFID Integrated Circuits (ICs) that are provided with built-in sensors. In particular, this paper will focus on the latest advancements in the field of RFID breath sensor-devices that wirelessly monitor respiration by measuring the temperature gradients of the air flowing through the airways. The main innovations span from improvements in the lightweight design of the devices and materials, the enhancement of the sensing capabilities by doubling the embedded sensors on the same device, and, most importantly, the thorough experimentation performed to assess the clinical meaningfulness of temperature breathing waveforms with respect to conventional clinical-grade flow-based methods.

Due to the distance between devices, battery power, and the possibility of sudden device failure, the network that connects the devices must be scalable, energy efficient, and flexible. Particular attention must be paid to the protection of the transmitted data. The Bluetooth mesh was chosen as such a network. This network is built on top of Bluetooth Low-Energy devices, which are widespread in the market and whose radio modules are available from several manufacturers. This paper presents an overview of security mechanisms for the Bluetooth mesh network. This network provides encryption at two layers: network and upper transport layers, which increases the level of data security. The network uses sequence numbers for each message to protect against replay attacks. The introduction of devices into the network is provided with an encryption key, and the out-of-band (OOB) mechanism is also supported. At the moment, a comparison has been made between attacks and defense mechanisms that overlap these attacks. The article also suggested ways to improve network resiliency.

The core idea is to encode a protocol data unit (PDU) in terms of the silence duration between two sets of delimiter pulses, whose positions are modulated based on the value of the PDU. This PPCP architecture achieves significant energy savings by using a lesser amount of bit/pulse transmissions, and by eliminating long multi-bit preambles and headers, which are normally used in traditional packets. The proposed multi-access pulse-based PDU scheme enables medium sharing among many sensor nodes without requiring per-PDU frame synchronization. Unlike previous Communication through Silence (CtS) literature, a full architecture design and prototype hardware platform of PPCP is presented here to demonstrate its advantages in terms of energy savings, reduced transmission delays, and ease of implementation. The advantages of PPCP compared to state-of-the-art Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and legacy binary packets are also shown. The prototype implementation shows reliable error detection based on a novel mechanism that relies on the inherent pulse-position modulation-based coding technique.

A low power multi-step Ph-ADC for zero intermediate frequency (IF) GFSK receivers as defined in Bluetooth low energy protocol is proposed in this paper. With dedicatedly designed binary code scheme and multi-step operation, the Ph-ADC requires only 52 current elements and one comparator, in contrast to the design in literature using 260 current elements and 8 comparators. Non-idealities due to transconductance errors and offset errors are theoretically analyzed, followed by a design strategy to minimize trip point errors. Simulation results show that the digital intensive Ph-ADC consumes only 7.9 mu A current from a 1.8 V supply when implemented in a 180 nm CMOS process. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the maximum trip point error is only 2.3A degrees, which is less than 1/8 least significant bit. When the Ph-ADC is used in a GFSK demodulator, the required IF E-b/N-0 is 13.5 dB to achieve a bit error rates of 0.1%.

This paper proposes the definition of a new concept of AT within the context of the ITS, Assistive Intelligent Transportation System (AITS), analyzing its intrinsic requirements and providing a set of examples. We demonstrate that AITS must localize users with disabilities and identify their specific type of impairment in order to provide an efficient response, and we propose a specific procedure to guarantee anonymity while identifying the type of disability. Moreover, this new type of AT is illustrated by means of a new assistive intelligent pedestrian crossing application that is capable of localizing pedestrians with disabilities, identifying the specific type of impairment and providing an adaptive response to enhance functional capabilities of impaired pedestrians while crossing. By combining stereo-based object detection with radio-frequency identification technology (RFID and Bluetooth Low Energy), a specific solution to the problem of user localization and anonymous disability identification is proposed. Our approach has been validated in a real crosswalk scenario and it may be extended to other types of AITS, depending on the localization accuracy requirements and the range of operation of the specific application.

It can be considered on many different levels of granularity, varying from geolocation that is based on GPS systems, up to microlocation that uses Bluetooth Low Energy devices and WiFi access points for locating users inside buildings. Most common use of location is navigation, however recently it is more often considered also as an important component of the user profile. One of the biggest challenges in location-based context-aware systems is the discovery of patterns in user transportation traces and extraction of the most often visited places. In this paper we presented and evaluated a method that allows for automatic extraction of clusters from user location traces. These clusters represents user points of interest like home, work, favourite restaurants, but also transportation routines. The original contribution of this work is a proposal of an approach based on the K-means clustering algorithm equipped with a module for automatic discovery of number of clusters and density-based cluster merging. This method allows for online, adaptable discovery of user points of interests, and transportation routines in mobile systems.

We first use extensive measurement studies with multiple Android devices to establish that the BLE interface on current smartphones is not as "low-energy" as nominally expected, and establish that continuous use of such a BLE interface is not feasible unless we choose a moderately large scan interval and a low duty cycle. We then explore the implications of such constraints, on the parameters of a smartphone's BLE stack, on the accuracy of a BLE-based indoor localization techniques. We show that while RF-based indoor location can be highly accurate (80% of estimates have errors less than or equal to 4 meters) for stationary users only if the density of beacons is high, the combination of (large scan interval, low duty cycle) causes the location error to degrade significantly for moving users. These results provide practical insights into the use cases and limitations for future BLE-based mobile services.

Recently, several works have analyzed the topic of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device discovery through analytical or simulation models limited to version 4.x. Non-connectable and non-scannable undirected advertising has been shown to be a reliable alternative for discovering a high number of devices in a relatively short time period. However, new features of Bluetooth 5.0 allow us to define a variant on the device discovery process, based on BLE scannable undirected advertising events, which results in higher discovering capacities and also lower power consumption. In order to characterize this new device discovery process, we experimentally model the real device behavior of BLE scannable undirected advertising events. Non-detection packet probability, discovery probability, and discovery latency for a varying number of devices and parameters are compared by simulations and experimental measurements. We demonstrate that our proposal outperforms previous works, diminishing the discovery time and increasing the potential user device density. A mathematical model is also developed in order to easily obtain a measure of the potential capacity in high density scenarios.

Acquiring and transmitting environmental data is an energy-intensive workload, especially when considering networks spanning large buildings or even cities. Many works aim to integrate energy harvesting into wireless sensors, providing them with a greater level of energy autonomy. Initially deployed for energy-rich outdoor environments, recent advances have allowed wireless sensors to efficiently utilize the reduced energy harvested in indoor lighting conditions. This demo introduces a harvesting-based Dual Processor Platform, the DPP3e, designed for energy harvesting in indoor environments. It features various sensors for advanced indoor environmental sensing, e.g. air quality measurements, a low-power display for immediate visual feedback, and a powerful microcontroller for energy-efficient inference of Tensorflow models. Furthermore, it has two separate RF interfaces: a 2.4 GHz Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio for short-range communication, and a sub-GHz transceiver for long-range communication. Using configurable power domains and advanced power management, it can sustain sending BLE packets every 5 seconds while consuming only 37 mu W.

Yet, the unknown accuracy of contact estimation by onboard wireless technologies in real use hinders their broader employment. We address this challenge by conducting a measurement study with a custom testbed to show the capabilities and limitations of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in different scenarios. Distance estimation is based on interpreting the signal pathloss with a basic linear and a logarithmic model yielding an accuracy of 2-4 m. Further, we compare our results with accurate ultra-wideband (UWB) distance measurement, which is able to reduce the distance error to 0.9 m. While the BLE distance error may not seem sufficiently accurate, we show that a simple threshold-based contact detector achieves an F1-score accuracy of 64%, which can be improved to 69% when the carrying position of the phone is known. It is further shown that multi-path signal propagation reduces the effect of body shielding and thus increases detection accuracy in indoor scenarios.

In fingerprint positioning, a site-survey is conducted in advance to build the radio map which can be used to match radio signatures with specific locations. Thus, it can take the impacts of empirical indoor environments into consideration. However, even if the physical positional relationship in the indoor environment is static, the observed RSSI values are dynamically fluctuated according to the probabilistic wireless channels. Unfortunately, it is difficult to analytically capture the stochastic behavior of RSSI in real-environments, and the accuracy of position estimation is degraded due to the model errors. To tackle this challenging problem, machine learning-based logistic regression is applied to fingerprint positioning with the RSSI data set (available as big data). Additionally, by exploiting a unified fingerprint generated from both Wi-Fi and BLE beacon signals, further performance improvement in the estimation accuracy is possible, owing to the transmit diversity effects. The experimental results show the validity of the proposed positioning scheme with the unified Wi-Fi and BLE fingerprint.

As the Internet of Things (IoT) comes of age, people increasingly want to use various devices in the surrounding environment in conjunction with their smartphones. The cost of developing services that cooperate with the devices is high because various kinds of devices exist and multiple OSs for smartphones need to be supported. To mitigate the issue, we propose a dynamic device connection method that can connect services (e.g. Web applications) with devices located close to users by installing the device drivers and/or protocol adapters dynamically. Developers can create new Web applications easily because the device drivers absorb the differences of the devices and provide a common Web interface for them. The protocol adapters provide access capability to OS application programming interfaces (APIs) for Web technology. We implemented the proposed method on an Android smartphone and evaluated it with Bluetooth Low Energy devices and a Classic Bluetooth device. Results showed that the method absorbs the difference of function and protocol and delivers a reasonable performance.

Currently, Bluetooth Low Energy has been the most commonly used technology for such services due to its low cost, low power consumption, ubiquitous availability in smartphones and the dependence of the signal strength on the distance between devices. The article proposes a system that detects the proximity between static (anchors) and moving objects, evaluates the quality of this prediction and filters out the unreliable results based on custom metrics. We define three metrics: two matrics based on RSSI and Intertial Measurement Unit (IMU) readings and one joint metric. This way the filtering is based on both, the external information (RSSI) and the internal information (IMU). To process the IMU data, we use machine learning activity recognition models (we apply feature selection and compare three models and choose the best one-Gradient Boosted Decision Trees). The proposed system is flexible and can be easily customized. The great majority of operations can be conducted directly on smartphones. The solution is easy to implement, cost-efficient and can be deployed in real-life applications (MICE industry, museums, industry).

In fact, for treatments, games or sports, it is possible to find examples of the use of muscle signals to analyse specific aspects related, e.g., to disease, injuries or movement impulses. However, these systems are usually expensive, does not integrate data acquisition with the muscle stimulation and does not exhibit an adaptive control behaviour that consider the pathology and the patient response. This paper presents a wearable system that integrates the signal acquisition and the electrostimulation using dry thin-film titanium-based electrodes. The acquired data is transmitted to a mobile application running on a smartphone by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, where it is analysed by employing artificial intelligence algorithms to provide customised treatments for each patient profile and type of pathology, and taking into consideration the feedback of the acquired electromyography signal. The acquired patient's data is also stored in a secure cloud database to support the physician to analyse and follow-up the clinical results from the rehabilitation process.

However, the key challenge in designing WPT-supplied smart sensors is to ensure that the harvested power is higher than the consumed power in presence of strong WPT path loss. This paper presents the design and optimization of a smart sensor supplied by 2.45-GHz RF power and performing infrared-based motion detection and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. The full system (RF energy harvester, power management, sensor transducer and interface, control, data processing and wireless transmission) is implemented using low-power off-the-shelf components. In the sensing sub-system, low average power is achieved using efficient duty-cycling of the analog front-end. In the harvesting sub-system, architecture choice and design of the matching network and rectifier circuit allow to optimize the total power harvesting efficiency (PHE). The implemented smart sensor can operate reliably with an incident RF power as low as -10.9 dBm. The sensing sub-system exhibits an average power of 4.3 mu W and a maximum number of transmitted event packets of 60 packets per hour.

This goal can be achieved by adopting a suitable real-time communication protocol. In addition, connecting such systems with mobile devices is also desirable for performing configuration, monitoring, and maintenance activities. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) protocol would be an attractive solution for this purpose, because it is supported by consumer devices, such as tablets and smart phones, for implementing personal area networks with reduced energy consumption. Unfortunately, however, it cannot guarantee a bounded delay for managing real-time traffic. Modern BLE radio transceivers allow partitioning the network bandwidth between the BLE protocol and another user-defined protocol running on top of the raw radio. This paper exploits this feature to provide an analysis and a design methodology to guarantee the feasibility of a real-time custom protocol that shares the radio with the BLE. Experimental results on a Nordic reference platform show the feasibility of the dual-protocol approach and its capability to support a custom real-time protocol on the raw radio with a bounded overhead.

In an aging society, it is important to home care elderly and maintain their daily needs and provide safe evacuation alternatives in the case emergency. Hence, this paper aims to implement and evaluate a smart and location-aware indoor emergency evacuation system for elderly users. The prototype system employs multiple Bluetooth Low Energy and iBeacon sensors and a smartphone. The smartphone utilizes the beacon signals to estimate its location within the building and uses the sensor data transmitted by the iBeacons to identify the level of threat (if any) to the elderly user and guide him/ her to a safe zone in the case of fire, earthquake etc. Our prototype was tested in three different locations utilizing two different types of sensors. The results show that our system can detect a threat and guide the elderly user with minimum 85.47 centimeters and maximum 239.8 centimeters distance error.

In our previous work, we had presented developmental aspects of an insole based activity and gait monitoring system-SmartStep, which is a socially acceptable, fully wireless and versatile insole. The present work describes the development of an Android application that captures the SmartStep data wirelessly over Bluetooth Low energy (BLE), computes features on the received data, runs activity classification algorithms and provides real time feedback. The development of activity classification methods was based on the the data from a human study involving 4 participants. Participants were asked to perform activities of sitting, standing, walking, and cycling while they wore SmartStep insole system. Multinomial Logistic Discrimination (MLD) was utilized in the development of machine learning model for activity prediction. The resulting classification model was implemented in an Android Smartphone. The Android application was benchmarked for power consumption and CPU loading. Leave one out cross validation resulted in average accuracy of 96.9% during model training phase. The Android application for real time activity classification was tested on a human subject wearing SmartStep resulting in testing accuracy of 95.4%.

These include reactive use cases, e.g., alerting individuals of hazards or interaction opportunities, and others concerned only with logging proximity data, e.g., for offline analysis and modeling. Common approaches rely on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or ultra-wideband (UWB) radios. Nevertheless, these strike opposite tradeoffs between the accuracy of distance estimates quantifying proximity and the energy effciency affecting system lifetime, effectively forcing a choice between the two and ultimately constraining applicability. Janus reconciles these dimensions in a dual-radio protocol enabling accurate and energy-effcient proximity detection, where the energy-savvy BLE is exploited to discover devices and coordinate their distance measurements, acquired via the energy-hungry UWB. A model supports domain experts in con.guring Janus for their use cases with predictable performance. The latency, reliability, and accuracy of Janus are evaluated experimentally, including realistic scenarios endowed with the mm-level ground truth provided by a motion capture system. Energy measurements show that Janus achieves weeks to months of autonomous operation, depending on the use case con.guration. Finally, several large-scale campaigns exemplify its practical usefulness in real-world contexts.

Future smart camera architectures require battery-operated devices to facilitate deployment for scenarios such as industrial monitoring, environmental monitoring and smart city, consequently imposing constraints on the node energy consumption. This paper provides an analysis of the inter-effects between computation and communication energy for a smart camera node. Based on a people counting scenario, we evaluate the trade-off for the node energy consumption with different processing configurations of the image processing tasks, and several communication technologies. The results indicate that the optimal partition between the smart camera node and remote processing is with background modelling, segmentation, morphology and binary compression implemented in the smart camera, supported by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) version 5 technologies. The comparative assessment of these results with other implementation scenarios underlines the energy efficiency of this approach. This work changes pre-conceptions regarding design space exploration in WVSN, motivating further investigation regarding the inclusion of intermediate processing layers between the node and the cloud to interlace low-power configurations of communication and processing architectures.

These are usually wirelessly connected with digital signal processing part implemented separately and often stationary. This causes a limited mobility and results in an additional, although avoidable, latency due to the wireless transmission channel. Therefore, a novel, entirely mobile FPGA-based platform for BCIs has been designed and implemented. While featuring highly efficient adaptability to targeted algorithms due to the ultra low power Flash-based FPGA, the stackable system design and the configurable hardware ensure flexibility for the use in different application scenarios. Powered through a single Li-ion battery, the miniaturized system area of half the size of a credit card leads to high mobility and thus allow for real-world scenario applicability. A Bluetooth Low Energy extension can be connected without any significant area cost, if a wireless data or control signal transmission channel is required. The resulting system is capable of acquiring and fully processing of up to 32 EEG channels with 24 bit precision each and a sampling rate of 250-16k samples per second with a total weight less than 60 g.

The catheter-based cystometry normally used for bladder pressure measurement is not conducive to patient health because it will bring great mental stress to the patient and increase the risk of infection. Method: This paper designs and implements an implantable wireless and batteryless bladder pressure monitor system that monitors bladder storage in real time by implanting a miniature packaged sensor which transmits the feedback signal to the external receiver through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The implanted part is powered by a dedicated magnetic resonance based wireless power transmission system, which means no battery is needed. Results: The maximum distance to which power can be transmitted is 7cm. The in vitro experiment proves that the system performance can meet the requirement of bladder pressure monitoring. The animal experiment uses rabbits as a model to verify the effectiveness of the system. After implantation, this system can work for a long time without replacing the battery. Conclusion: This system can monitor the pressure of the bladder and provide a basis for Closed-loop neuromodulation in patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction.

Due to the influence of various external environmental factors, it is very difficult to improve the accuracy in indoor location tracking. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel method of reducing the noise generated in the external environment by using a double Gaussian filter. In addition, the value of the RSSI signal generated in the BLE beacon is different for each device. In this study, we propose a method to allocate additional weights in order to compensate the intensity of signal generated in each device. This makes it possible to improve the accuracy of indoor location tracking using beacons. The experiment results show that the proposed method effectively decrease the RSSI deviation and increase location accuracy. In order to verify the usefulness of this study, we compared the Kalman filter algorithm which is widely used in signal processing. We further performed additional experiments for application area for indoor location service and find that the proposed scheme is useful for BLE-based indoor location service.

Measuring these signals using a device and analyzing their interrelationships simultaneously can improve the accuracy of existing methods and propose new approaches for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we have presented a novel smart stethoscope based on multimodal physiological signal measurement technology for personal cardiovascular health monitoring. The proposed device is designed in the shape of a compact personal computer mouse for easy grasping and attachment to the surface of the chest using only one hand. A digital microphone and photoplehysmogram sensor are installed on the bottom and top surfaces of the device, respectively, to measure heart sound and pulse from the user's chest and finger simultaneously. In addition, a high-performance Bluetooth Low Energy System-on-Chip ARM microprocessor is used for pre-processing of measured data and communication with the smartphone.

To do this, many vendors and IT companies have established IoT standard organizations. In particular, the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), the most influential IoT standard organization, has been actively developing the OCF standard and an open-source software framework called IoTivity. The OCF standard supports interoperability through bridging techniques toward non-OCF devices of other ecosystems, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth low energy, oneM2M, and AllJoyn. Among several bridging techniques, we focus on developing an OCF-to-ZigBee (O2Z) bridging technique which is very important to provide the scalability of the OCF standard. This is because there are many ZigBee devices to construct IoT applications (e.g., lightening, heating, and sensing), and the number of them is steadily increasing. In this article, we introduce the O2Z bridging technique adopted in the OCF standard, and describe how to implement an O2Z bridging plugin as a software component of IoTivity. This work would provide a good guideline for developing other bridging techniques toward other IoT ecosystems.

This scenario promotes the ability to satisfy the growing demand for innovative measuring systems, increasingly popular consisting of intelligent nodes, totally wireless, easy to install, and that requires the least possible maintenance. In this context, this paper aims to contribute to state of the art with an energy-autonomous and battery-free measurement platform designed to measure the ambient light power when its level exceeds the sensitivity threshold. The measurement platform utilizes a single transducer to scavenge energy and concurrently measure the ambient light intensity. The result is a wireless measurement platform, which requires neither a battery nor a specific ambient light sensor, with the immediate advantage of achieving greater energy efficiency and using fewer components. The device implements off-the-shelf components on a printed circuit board (PCB) with a tag size of 2 x 2 cm(2). Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) implements radio implements device connectivity. Experimental data show that the device can acquire energy and detect ambient light with a limit of detection (LoD) of 250 lux and accuracy below 12%.

The reliability and usability of such systems are highly based on their accuracy as well as cost and ease of deployment. Although the Global Positioning System (GPS) is an accurate solution for outdoor use, it can not be used indoors. A popular approach is a wireless navigation system which makes use of Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI). However, signal propagation, as well as surrounding noise and a dynamic environment, can affect their performance. Recent advancements in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and the introduction of small and inexpensive beacons can alleviate the problem. In this work, we introduce an indoor navigation system with BLE beacons. To measure system accuracy an Android application was developed to collect the signal. Moreover, a Kalman filter was also developed within the application to improve the accuracy. Experimental results showed improvement of systems accuracy in three square topologies. The Kalman filter improved the accuracy up to 78.9%. while the experiments also show a correlation between the overall accuracy and how close BLE beacons are to each other.

Continuous monitoring is performed by means of massive machinery, requiring complex installation at the patient's premises, or cumbersome portable devices. Combining noninvasive wearable monitoring devices, based on patient's criticality, it is possible to obtain qualitative data to evaluate the patient's quality of life variation. In clinical environment it is possible to talk of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). It can be defined as the physical, mental and social outcome of medical treatment and chronic disease. These effects can be measured not only through the patient's perception but also with objective evaluations on patient's physical status. Aim of this paper is to introduce a simple and pervasive methodology to monitor the QoL variation by means of two portable devices already available on the market: a Bluetooth Low Energy Activity Tracker (BLE-ACT) and a Bluetooth Loop and Event Recorder (BT-LER). Using objective qualitative measurements obtained via such devices that follow the Pervasive Computing Paradigm (Ubicomp), it is possible to Estimate the QoL variation.

Poor sleep caused by snoring can create significant physical, mental, and economic problems. A simple and natural solution for snoring is to sleep on the side, instead of sleeping on the back. In this project, a deep learning model for snoring detection is developed and the model is transferred to an embedded system-referred to as the listener module-to automatically detect snoring. A novel wearable gadget is developed to apply a vibration notification on the upper arm until the snorer sleeps on the side. The gadget is rechargeable, and it is wirelessly connected to the listener module using low energy Bluetooth. A smartphone app-connected to the listener module using home Wi-Fi-is developed to log the snoring events with timestamps, and the data can be transferred to a physician for treating and monitoring diseases such as sleep apnea. The snoring detection deep learning model has an accuracy of 96%. A prototype system consisting of the listener module, the wearable gadget, and a smartphone app has been developed and tested successfully.

IoT has transformed nearly every industry, opening up huge opportunities for future innovation and progress. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), as one important application area of IoT, has changed healthcare delivery, such as by playing a crucial role in treating diabetic patients with the use of Artificial Pancreas System (APS). On the other hand, a slew of current and new security threats have put IMoT's ability to offer services safely in jeopardy. Hence, it is critical to minimize these security problems, such as by safeguarding information traveling from one IMoT device to another. In this context, we investigated two vital protocols for secure communication in APS: Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC). Consequently, we performed an experimental evaluation of these protocols based on a number of performance metrics, including protocol execution time, transmission cost, and total round-trip time. As a result, while both protocols perform similarly in terms of the first metrics, Bluetooth LE excels in terms of transmission cost, and EDHOC outperforms in terms of round-trip time.

J	Thaljaoui, A; El Khediri, S				Thaljaoui, Adel; El Khediri, Salim			Adopting Dilution of Precision for Indoor Localization	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Localization; BLE; RSSI; Accuracy; DOP		Due to the rising number of aged people in the last decades, many apprehensions about their quality of life and their personal security in their own homes came to surface especially when these persons prefer to live alone. Compared to other age groups, old persons are more susceptive to domestic incidents, such as sudden illnesses and falls. Therefore, using new technologies in elderly homecare became one of the most urgent issues to study. These technologies are classified into three categories: real time vital sign monitoring, activity recognition and indoor localization. In this paper we present our work in indoor positioning which is the combination of three existing technologies in a more effective, precise and accurate way: Bluetooth Low Energy, Acoustic and Light Fidelity (LiFi). Our main contribution is the proposition of new "dilution of precision" (DOP) indicators as precision weights of the results given by each technology. Depending on these new DOP-like indicators, we were able to judge how much precise and accurate the returned results are. The experiments we conducted proved that precision is much better when using these new precision metrics.

Sensors of this type are found attached almost to every body segment, capable of delivering signals even in harsh activity scenarios. The reliability and relevance of the physiological data retrieved by wearables have yet to surpass the conventional technologies in the healthcare system today. In this paper we present a small device incorporated inside an headphone set that continuously monitors the ECG, impedance and acceleration of the head. As opposed to most biometric sensors, ECG measurement relies on non-optical methods by capturing the electrical potential around the ear in both sides of the head, whereas impedance monitoring involves AC stimulation instead of DC, the latter commonly involved in skin galvanic response estimation. Signal processing of impedance parameters is performed in situ using a fast variant of the Discrete Fourier Transform in order to save computational resources and power expenditure from a microcontroller equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy. Applications that can benefit from this device include cardiovascular and stress level assessment of individuals	[Rosa, Bruno M.

Bluetooth v4.0 is the latest version of a wireless communication standard for low-speed and low-range data transfer among devices in a human's PAN. It allows increased network mobility among devices such as headsets, PDAs, wireless keyboards and mice. A pairing process is initiated when two devices desire to communicate, and this pairing needs to correctly authenticate devices so that a secret link key is established for secure communication. What is interesting is that device authentication relies on humans to communicate verification information between devices via a human-aided out-of-band channel. Bluetooth v4.0's SSP protocol is designed to offer security against passive eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. We conduct the first known detailed analysis of SSP for all its MitM-secure models. We highlight some issues related to exchange of public keys and use of the passkey in its models and discuss how to treat them properly.

During its full nationwide operation (2018/122021/01), VALID consists of virtual devices at 3 million shops and restaurants, where 530,859 of them are in multi-story malls and markets to infer and influence 1 million couriers' behavior, and assist the scheduling of 3.9 billion orders for 186 million customers. Although indoor arrival detection is straightforward in controlled environments, the scale of our platform makes the cost prohibitively high. In this work, we explore to use merchants' smartphones under their consent as a virtual infrastructure to design, build, deploy, and operate VALID from in-lab conception to nationwide operation in three phases for 30 months. We consider metrics including system evolution, reliability, utility, participation, energy, privacy, monetary benefits, along with couriers' behavior changes. We share three lessons and their implications for similar wireless sensing or communication systems with large geospatial operations.

Both chips are implemented in standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology with total layout areas of 1.575 mm(2) and 0.0126 mm(2), respectively. The system also contains an off-the-shelf 3.2 mm x 2.5 mm 0.9 mm supercapacitor working as an off-chip battery or energy reservoir between the PMU and the voltage regulator. Experimental results show that the fast energy recovery of the on-chip solar cell and PMU permits the system to replenish the supercapacitor with enough charge as to sustain Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communications even with input light powers of 510 nW. The whole system is able to self-start-up without external mechanisms at 340 nW. This work is the first step towards a self-supplied sensor node with processing and communication capabilities. The small form factor and ultra-low power consumption of the system components is in compliance with biomedical applications requirements.

In recent years, the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocol is achieving a large portion of the market, thanks to its low-power and low-cost orientation and its pervasiveness in mobile devices, like smartphones. For these reasons, BLE is increasingly used in IoT-oriented Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN), where a small set of devices arranged in star topology network and connected to a smartphone and a Wi-Fi gateway, can cover a large number of monitoring and controlling use case scenarios. This work presents the ST's STM32 Open Development Environment (ODE), a complete suite of hardware and software tools representing a reference point for end-users willing to create BLE-based star topology networks for a wide range of applications. Through a simple use case in a smart home context, it is shown how all provided tools can be used to fast prototype applications addressing all user requirements.

In this context, there is a set of Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSIs), which is received by wearable devices worn by the inhabitants, from a set of BLE beacons deployed in objects within a smart environment. The RSSIs generated by the BLE beacons are influenced by external factors in radio waves, which are presented in the RSSI as important fluctuations. The main contribution in this work has been to propose the use of fuzzy logic and the fuzzy linguistic approach to model indicators of fluctuation. A new framework is introduced that includes a Mamdani fuzzy inference system to recognize the activity that is being carried out in real time for each inhabitant based on data gleaned from their wearable device. The fuzzy rules in addition to the fuzzy linguistic terms used to model the RSSIs can be customized for each inhabitant according to their habits, customs or routines. A case study of the proposed fuzzy framework in the smart lab of the University of Jaen is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

This factor is closely related to the increase of air pollution, traffic congestion and road non-safety. Due to this, the automotive industry and research entities have put lots of efforts in exploring the potential of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These efforts have been focused on trying to add ITS systems to the new cars of the future. The present work describes a proposal for taking advantage of ITS possibilities using the vehicles that are nowadays on our roads. In particular, the described platform is mainly based on smartphones, but also on sensors and servers. The proposal is based on a hybrid scheme that combines an online mode using the Internet access of the smartphone, with an offline mode using wireless technologies such as WiFi Direct and Bluetooth Low Energy to define various ITS applications related with traffic collisions, violations, jams, signs and lights, and parking management. The described system has been developed for the Android platform, producing promising results.

The rapid proliferation of smartphones has led to many IPSs that utilize positioning technologies that are readily available on modern smartphones; including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Using radio signals such as BLE in indoor environments comes with a number of challenges that can limit the reliability of the signal. In dealing with these challenges, most existing BLE-based IPSs introduce undesired drawbacks such as an extensive and fragile calibration phase, strict hardware requirements, and increases in the system's complexity. In this paper, an IPS is developed and evaluated that requires minimal setup for indoor environments and has a sufficiently low complexity to be run locally on a modern smartphone. An extensive exploration of the IPS' parameters was performed. The best performing parameter combinations resulted in a median positioning error of 1.48 +/- 0.283 meters, while using the log-distance path loss model for distance estimation and Weighted Centroid Localization with a weight exponent between 2.0 and 3.5 for position estimation.

Within this investigation, we discovered some characteristics of participants with visual impairments, routes traveled, and real-world environments that have been included in recent wayfinding research as well as information regarding the institutions, agencies, and funding sources that enable these investigations. Results showed that 33 out of the 35 studies which met inclusionary criteria integrated the use of smart device technology. Many of these devices were supplemented by bluetooth low-energy beacons, and other sensors with more recent studies integrating LIDAR scanning. Identified studies included scant information about participant's visual acuities or etiologies with a few exceptions, which limits the usability of the findings for this highly heterogeneous population. Themes derived from this study are categorized around the individual traveler's needs; the wayfinding technologies identified and their perceived efficacy; the contexts and routes for wayfinding tasks; and the institutional support offered for sustaining wayfinding research.

It provides a low-energy and low-cost solution for short-range radio transmissions. Bluetooth, more specifically Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become the predominant technology for connecting IoT (Internet of Things). It can be found in cell phones, headsets, speakers, printers, keyboards, automobiles, children's toys, and medical devices, as well as many other devices. The technology can also be found in automated smart homes, to provide monitors and controls for lights, thermostats, door locks, appliances, security systems, and cameras. Bluetooth offers convenience and ease of use, but it lacks a centralized security infrastructure. As a result, it has serious security vulnerabilities, and the need for awareness of the security risks are increasing as the technology becomes more widespread. This paper presents an overview of Bluetooth technology in IoT including its security, vulnerabilities, threats, and risk mitigation solutions, as well as real-life examples of exploits. Our study highlights the importance of understanding attack risks and mitigation techniques involved with using Bluetooth technology on our devices. Real-life examples of recent Bluetooth exploits are presented. Several recommended security measures are discussed to secure Bluetooth communication.

As such, the costs and requirements of providing such services need to be minimal. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate Tack, a new mobile application framework that is specifically engineered to support such contextual and ephemeral indoor localization during an event. To provide location-based services with Tack, an event organizer only needs to bring and place a small number of (reusable) beacons around the venue before the event begins. As a system framework, Tack uses a combination of known beacon locations, contacts over bluetooth low energy, crowdsourcing, and dead-reckoning to estimate and refine user locations.

Despite extensive research on localization, system requirements, such as site survey, user intervention, or specific hardware/software, place limitations on the widespread deployment of localization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a path estimation and localization system for indoor environments, termed PYLON, that runs on a smartphone and a server without any human intervention. PYLON uses an actual floor plan and measurements from widely deployed WiFi access points (APs) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to estimate the user's path. It creates virtual rooms according to received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values and matches them to actual rooms in the real-world floor plan. After room mapping, PYLON uses door passing times to precisely refine a user's estimated path. Unlike conventional path estimation and localization systems, PYLON works independently of device types. We implement PYLON on five Android smartphones and conduct evaluation with three users in an office building. Our experimental results show that PYLON achieves 97 percent floor plan mapping accuracy with a localization error of 1.42 m.

Many studies on a congestion estimation have been conducted so far. However, most of them suffer from high deployment/operation costs and/or rely on contributions by users with smartphones/sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel system that estimates congestion of sightseeing spots in real-time without attaching any device to tourists by observing the distribution of per-RSSI intensity occurrences in each time window when beacon signals are periodically sent between BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) transceivers installed in sightseeing spots. In other words, our system can estimate the congestion degree in sightseeing spots simply by using the property of RSSI intensity which dramatically changes depending on the number of people. Therefore, the proposed system is simple and low cost and can estimate the congestion easily without any special devices attached to tourists. In the demonstration, we show the congestion degree in three levels (low, medium, and high) changing in real-time depending on the number of audience in the demonstration	[Umeki, Kazuhito; Nakamura, Yugo; Fujimoto, Manato; Arakawa, Yutaka; Yasumoto, Keiichi] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan	Nara Institute of Science & Technology	Umeki, K (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan.	umeki.kazuhito.uf7@is.naist.jp; nakamura.yugo.ns0@is.naist.jp; manato@is.naist.jp; ara@is.naist.jp; yasumoto@is.naist.jp	Yasumoto, Keiichi/AAC-2822-2022		JSPS KAKENHI [16H01721, 17J10021]; Commissioned Research of National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), JAPAN; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17J10021] Funding Source: KAKEN	JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Commissioned Research of National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), JAPAN; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))	This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16H01721, 17J10021 and the Commissioned Research of National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), JAPAN.		6	0	0	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2474-2503		978-1-5386-3227-7	INT CONF PERVAS COMP			2018														3	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Telecommunications	BP1XG					2023-06-19	WOS:000541062400079

Smartphone-facilitated digital contact tracing may help to increase tracing capabilities and extend the coverage to those contacts one does not know in person. Most implemented protocols use local Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication to detect contagionrelevant proximity, together with cryptographic protections, as necessary to improve the privacy of the users of such a system. However, current decentralized protocols, including DP3T [T+20], do not sufficiently protect infected users from having their status revealed to their contacts, which raises fear of stigmatization. We alleviate this by proposing a new and practical solution with stronger privacy guarantees against active adversaries. It is based on the upload-what-you-observed paradigm, includes a separation of duties on the server side, and a mechanism to ensure that users cannot deduce which encounter caused awarningwith high time resolution. Finally, we present a simulation-based security notion of digital contact tracing in the real-ideal setting, and prove the security of our protocol in this framework.

Instead of showing a meaningless black screen, the Ambient Mode provides meaningful and emotional background experiences. To mitigate users' concern about the cost of using the Ambient feature, the TV intelligently detects the presence of a person in the room from the registered mobile's BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) signal and Wi-Fi connection to AP (Access Point). If there is no user nearby, the TV intelligently turns off, to save energy (a manual-off timer is available too). To interact with both Android phone and iPhone, we design a general BLE advertisement for Android phone and an iBeacon format for iPhone. On the BLE proximity-based service, the Ambient Mode can be turned off/on based on the BLE signal presence. On the Wi-Fi connection based service for long-range detection, TV can detect mobile's AP connection using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). The proposed service and intelligent controls have been implemented as real products and launched the service of Ambient Mode in the market.

Bluetooth is one of the most popular and widely adopted means of communicating this sensed information to a mobile terminal. However, over simplified implementations of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) protocol in eHealth sector is susceptible to several wireless attacks, in particular the Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. The issue arises due to a lack of mutual authentication and integrity protection between the communicating devices, which may lead to compromise of confidentiality, availability and even the integrity of this safety-critical information. This research paper presents a novel framework named MARC to detect, analyze, and mitigate Bluetooth security flaws while focusing upon MITM attack against NiNo devices. For this purpose, a comprehensive solution has been proposed, which can detect MITM signatures based upon four novel anomaly detection metrics: analyzing Malicious scan requests, Advertisement intervals, RSSI levels, and Cloned node addresses. The proposed solution has been evaluated through practical implementation and demonstration of different attack scenarios, which show promising results concerning accurate and efficient detection of MITM attacks.

In this context, the continuous monitoring of the electrical potentials produced by muscles appears to be effective to detect abnormal events in a fast way. The recent progresses in EMG technologies have allowed for the development of low invasive and reliable EMG-based wearable device. These devices promote long-term monitoring, however they are often very expensive and not easy to be positioned appropriately. Moreover they use mono-use pre-gelled electrodes that can cause skin redness. To overcome the issues, a prototype of a new smart sock has been realized. It detects EMG signals coming from the Gastrocnemius-Tibialis muscles of the leg. Such muscles appear relevant for assessment of age-related changes in gait, sarcopenia pathology, postural anomalies, fall risk, etc. The developed socks are minimally invasive, lightweight and can send the data through a Bluetooth low energy connection. Moreover, they are equipped with reusable stretchable and non adhesive hybrid polymer electrolytes-based electrodes for high biocompatibility. In the paper it has been described, as a case study, the use of the socks to detect the risk of falling.

A key feature of connected car solutions is personalization. An advanced solution shall be able to enable complete personalization for each seat automatically. This paper presents the design and implementation of BlueID - a framework for robust in-car localization and on-demand personalization using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. BlueID identifies a user based on the user's mobile device and characterizes each seat using signals received from a pre-installed BLE beacon array. BlueID features a machine learning engine that can robustly distinguish seats in the presence of various environment and system dynamics such as varied antenna sensitivities and multiple seat occupants. To enable on-demand use cases, BlueID employs a connected car cloud platform to store each vehicle's seat prediction model and each user's personalization profile. The prediction model and the user's personalization profile are retrieved to personalize the environment where the user sits when the user enters the vehicle. We have implemented a prototype of BlueID and evaluated it through extensive experiments. The results show that BlueID achieves satisfactory in-car localization performance with average position accuracy over 98%.

These fitness trackers predominantly use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communicating and syncing the data with user's smartphone. This paper presents a measurement-driven study of possible privacy leakage from BLE communication between the fitness tracker and the smartphone. Using real BLE traffic traces collected in the wild and in controlled experiments, we show that majority of the fitness trackers use unchanged BLE address while advertising, making it feasible to track them. The BLE traffic of the fitness trackers is found to be correlated with the intensity of user's activity, making it possible for an eavesdropper to determine user's current activity (walking, sitting, idle or running) through BLE traffic analysis. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the BLE traffic can represent user's gait which is known to be distinct from user to user. This makes it possible to identify a person (from a small group of users) based on the BLE traffic of her fitness tracker. As BLE-based wearable fitness trackers become widely adopted, our aim is to identify important privacy implications of their usage and discuss prevention strategies.

We consider the case when traditional error correction codes are not available due to energy constraints at the transmitter. Using the CRC-24 code adopted by the Bluetooth Low Energy standard as an example, we show how two iterative techniques traditionally used for decoding of low-density parity check codes Belief Propagation (BP) and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)- can be applied to the high-density parity check matrix of the code. The performance of both techniques is evaluated through simulation, and it is demonstrated that a gain of up to 1.7 dB in terms of the SNR per bit and a total reduction of the packet error rate by more than 70% can be achieved compared with the non-correction scenario, at no extra cost for the transmitter. We also compare the two techniques and use the standard syndrome look-up method as a benchmark.

In order to reduce the number of capacitors in the Capacitor Digital to Analog Converter (CDAC), a split type DAC has been applied in a VCM-based switching scheme. Applying this, the number of the unit capacitors in each CDAC has been reduced by over 14 times. This reduces the area which is dominated by CDAC. Also, the input and reference buffers design specifications are relaxed, and the mismatch is reduced. The conversion speed for this design reaches up to 5 MS/s. The prototype ADC is designed in a 130 nm Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process. The analog and digital supply voltage ranges for this design are 2.7-5.5 V and 1.1-1.3 V respectively. For 5 MS/s conversion rate, this ADC achieves up to 11.85 and 11.3 effective number of bits (ENOBs), for maximum and minimum supply voltages respectively. The current consumption from a 5 V supply voltage is 560 mu A and the Figure of Merit (FOM) is 151 fJ/Conv.step.

Seismic event detection, however, is still a challenge due to a lack of high-fidelity sensing and classification efficiency. This study proposes BLESeis, an IoT sensor for smart earthquake detection. BLESeis comprises three main parts: (1) high-fidelity vibration sensing using a MEMS accelerometer and digital filtering; (2) an embedded earthquake detection algorithm; (3) BLE (Bluetooth low energy) beacon for earthquake notification. For high-fidelity vibration sensing, a triggering algorithm and embedded finite impulse response (FIR) low-pass filter are developed. The acquired vibration is then classified by the earthquake detection algorithm developed to identify the earthquake signal from other vibration sources using time and frequency domain analysis. Upon detection of an earthquake, the BLE beacon broadcasts using the proposed data packet for efficient notification and visualization. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated through numerical simulations and a set of experiments using shaking table tests. The experiments show the feasibility of the low-cost earthquake detection and notification system.

The study provided forklift operators with a graphical model of the warehouse. The goal of this study is to determine the shortest path from the initial point to the destination point with D* Lite algorithm. To execute D* Lite Algorithm Bluetooth Low Energy Triangulation was used. BLE Triangulation helped D* Lite Algorithm by mapping the warehouse and locating the real-time location of the forklift/s. The system is an effective path finding for forklift/s inside a warehouse. Through the implementation of the system the group was able to reduce the time needed for the operator to navigate the warehouse. The T-statistic value for tables IV,V and V is 13.0380, 14.0324, and 7.2088 respectively which is greater than the one-tailed critical value of 1.8331 that rejects the null hypothesis.Therefore, the implementation of the system is successful in reducing the time needed by forklift operators to navigate around the warehouse and that the system can be implemented with multiple forklifts.

Floor localization is especially critical to indoor positioning techniques. Numerous research efforts have been proposed for improving the floor localization accuracy using information from barometers, accelerometers, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Wi-Fi signals. Despite these existing efforts, no approach has been able to determine what floor smartphone users are on with near 100% accuracy. To address this problem, we present a novel pressure-pair based method called FloorPair, which offers near 100% accurate floor localization. The rationale of FloorPair is to construct a relative pressure map using highly accurate relative pressure values from smartphones with two novel features: first, we marginalized the uncertainty from sensor drifts and unreliable absolute pressure values of barometers by paring the pressure values of two floors, and second, we maintained high accuracy over time by applying an iterative optimization method, making our method sustainable. We evaluated the validity of the FloorPair approach by conducting extensive field experiments in various types of buildings to show that FloorPair is an accurate and sustainable floor localization method.

The platform can be tailored to varying scenarios by adjusting the ranging fidelity and the update rate and demonstrates dynamic adaptation to its environment. As a mobile, accurate, and reliable system for ranging measurements, it allows users to gather both distance and position information with decimeter accuracy. Measuring only 61 x 35mm and weighing 7.7 g, it integrates two radios to achieve both low-power neighbour discovery and direct user interactions using Bluetooth Low Energy as well as precise ultrawideband ranging measurements. The system introduces a novel energy-efficient ranging protocol with linear message complexity to achieve life times of up to 39 days. Furthermore, leveraging both antenna and frequency diversity, we demonstrate that the median ranging error can be reduced by up to 86% through an efficient aggregation of measurements over multiple channels. Our system is capable of highly reliable and consistent measurements with as little as 14.8 cm of ranging error in the 99th percentile and a 90% confidence interval of 11.3 cm.

In Bluetooth MANETs, mobile terminals communicate with each other using Bluetooth without communication infrastructures such as base stations. Therefore, Bluetooth MANETs are deemed to be one of the communication schemes to disseminate data when base stations cannot be used in case of disaster. Since data dissemination capability or network scale that can be built deeply depends on connection establishment performance in Bluetooth MANETs, a fast Bluetooth connection establishment scheme has been proposed to establish Bluetooth connections rapidly. The fast Bluetooth connection establishment scheme combines Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and it has advantages of two different Bluetooth standards. BLE beacons utilize advertising packets of BLE to broadcast data to adjacent terminals. Since the fast Bluetooth connection establishment scheme also utilizes BLE to detect adjacent terminals, it is thought that the radio interference cause delay in detecting adjacent terminals when there are many BLE beacons within wireless range. In this paper, we conducted the simulation experiments in the Bluetooth MANETs environment to evaluate the effects of BLE beacons on the connection establishment by the fast Bluetooth connection establishment scheme.

This is an annoying process when if the journey involves multiple stops. In this paper, we describe a working system of secure energy-efficient automatic ticketing (SEAT) for public transport, which transforms traditional check-in/check-out system into Be-in/Be-out system. In SEAT, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) enabled smartphone communicates with registration devices to track the journey for pricing without any human intervention. SEAT is vigilant toward the energy consumption of the BLE device under various conditions, and security and privacy threats to the overall ecosystem. We develop models for energy consumption and latency for BLE devices under the influence of mutual interference based on experiments with 32 BLE devices. We utilize these models to develop an energy-efficient protocol for SEAT that is secure and privacy preserving. Our experiments show that a BLE module consumes only 18.3 J daily under the proposed system model, which is less than 0.1% of the total capacity of a typical smartphone battery.

There also exist researches that estimate the route of the user from the location estimation results, visualize, and analyze it. In the conventional route estimation method based on the BLE beacon, after estimating the all locations from the radio field strength of the BLE, the route is estimated from the sequence of the estimated locations. Therefore, one of the causes of deterioration in accuracy could be the fact that the estimation was repeated twice. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel estimation method of the user's route and stay using BLE beacons. Specifically, we apply the idea of global map matching, used in the field of GPS, to route estimation based on BLE beacons. Thus, the global optimum route in beacon network can be estimated from the radio field intensities of the BLE beacon directly. We associate a beacon network with path network to estimate the route and stay of users. We installed approximately 1,600 BLE beacon transmitters in all the classrooms and corridors of Nagoya Institute of Technology, and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.

The technique implements an augmented reality (AR) based positioning system that is used to annotate the wireless signal parameter data samples with high precision position data. We track the position of a practical and low cost navigable setup of cameras and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon in an area decorated with AR markers. We maximize the performance of the AR-based localization by using a redundant number of markers. Video streams captured by the cameras are subjected to a series of marker recognition, subset selection and filtering operations to yield highly precise pose estimations. Our results show that we can reduce the positional error of the AR localization system to a rate under 0.05 meters. The position data are then used to annotate the BLE data that are captured simultaneously by the sensors stationed in the environment, hence, constructing a wireless signal dataset with the ground truth, which allows a wireless signal based localization system to be evaluated accurately.

We have developed a wireless opto-electro interface (WOENI) device, which combines electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording and optical stimulation for bi-directional neuromodulation on small, freely behaving animals, such as rodents. Approach. The device is comprised of two components, a detachable headstage and an implantable polyimide-based substrate. The headstage establishes a bluetooth low energy (BLE) bi-directional data communication with an external custom-designed USB dongle for receiving user commands and optogenetic stimulation patterns, and sending digitalized ECoG data. Main results. The functionality and stability of the device were evaluated in vivo on freely behaving rats. When the animal received optical stimulation on the primary visual cortex (V1) and visual stimulation via eyes, spontaneous changes in ECoG signals were recorded from both left and right V1 during four consecutive experiments with 7 d intervals over a time span of 21 d following device implantation. Immunostained tissue analyses showed results consistent with ECoG analyses, validating the efficacy of optical stimulation to upregulate the activity of cortical neurons expressing ChR2. Significance. The proposed WOENI device is potentially a versatile tool in the studies that involve long-term optogenetic neuromodulation.

At the same time, the networks size have grown larger than ever before. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons are an attractive solution for a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, from micro localization to advertisement and transportation. BLE beacons are small, low cost devices that are capable of providing contextual and locational information to the users. In the fifth generation (5G) ecosystem, many BLE beacons are expected to be deployed among other devices. In 5G wireless networks era, sustainable and energy aware networks are vital to usability and performance. An appealing solution for energy efficiency is energy harvesting for wireless devices. To reduce the maintenance and increase the lifespan of networks that include such devices, solar powered beacons can be used. In this paper, the performance of solar powered BLE beacons is examined in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy. A comparison between the solar powered BLE beacon and battery powered beacon is also discussed. Experimental results shown that solar powered BLE beacon is a promising solution with minimum energy requirements and high accuracy.

This paper presents a design method for a multi-band antenna using printed dipole with L-slots fed by a single coaxial cable. Using this method, a triple-band antenna that operates at 868-915 MHz for RFID (radio frequency identification), 1575 MHz for GPS (global positioning system) and 2.45 GHz for BLE (bluetooth low energy) was designed and manufactured. The antenna's parameters for triple-band operation are investigated and discussed. In this antenna design, ANSYS HFSS software using highly accurate finite element method (FEM) simulation is employed to analyze the entire structure. The designed antenna is manufactured using an FR-4 substrate with a dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) of 4.4 and thickness (h) of 1.6 mm. Many prototypes have been fabricated, and good agreement between simulations and measurements has been achieved. The performance of the prototypes has been measured in a standard far-field anechoic chamber. The proposed triple-band antenna is also tested by measuring the reading distance, and it is found that the proposed antenna can be used for RFID applications.

By using the method, we can analyze the behavior of the attendees at some large-scale exhibition, such as the order of the visited booth and the duration of the stay. Using mobile BLE tags has some advantages: to collect a large amount of data easily, to provide location estimation without smart phones. However, in a real environment. the BLE signal is unstable due to many people and obstacles. Fingerprinting is difficult because arranging booths finishes few hours before exhibition starts. Our previous trilateration method resulted in 10-30 meter accuracy with the data collected at Geospatial EXPO 2015 because of packet loss. We, to decrease packet loss, have developed tandem scanner that is equipped with multiple Bluetooth adapters. This paper presents the result of the improved method with the data collected by tandem scanners at Geospatial EXPO 2016. We also examined what improves accuracy: shorter advertising interval of the BLE tag and a larger number of tandem scanner's available adapters. Average location estimation accuracy was 4.51 meters when using best settings.

This technology has become even more important with the advent of the Internet of Things: each node acquires an IPv6 address and can be directly accessed from remote when the switch from IPv4 to IPv6 will take place. Such systems are actually applied in environment monitoring, home automation, industry, and lot of other fields. The Ambient Assisted Living scenery is a perfect field of application for sensor networks based on the IP protocol. The monitoring of elderly people, the automation of home appliances and the assistance to the person can be easily achieved through a network based on IPv6. Furthermore, such a system allows to obtain a maximum interoperability with existent networks, avoiding the need for inconvenient gateways to interface systems with different communication protocols. The presented work describes a complete hardware and software system able to solve the interoperability issue among Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living. Sub GHz frequency, mesh topology and low power consumption give a competitive advantage to the system against Bluetooth Low Energy or ZigBee technology.

Not only patients can't receive proper treatment by removing of medical tubing, but also complications such as bleeding and injury from the removal site are considered problematic. It has been adopted as a solution that frequent visits by nurses and monitoring patients, but their burden has become a problem. To reduce this issue, prior studies have examined systems for detecting medical tubing tension, but false positives were caused by patients turning over in bed or being cared for by nurses. Here we show that a prototype flexible sensor that independently detects medical tubing removal and tension. In the evaluation, the sensor detects tension by being pulled, and then applied a certain amount of force, it comes off. In addition, in order to monitor the status of medical tubing in real time, we implemented server transmission of sensor values via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), graphing, and LINE notification functions. Our results demonstrate that highly accurate medical tubing condition sensing is possible and reduces the burden on nurses and patients.

In this investigation, a wind-driven hybrid nanogenerator system comprising a poly(l-lactic acid)-based piezoelectric nanogenerator and a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) electret-based triboelectric nanogenerator (E-TENG) is proposed. At a wind speed of 5.1 m s(-1), the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and short-circuit current (I-sc) of the hybrid nanogenerator (NG) reach approximate to 140 V and 16 mu A, respectively. The maximum output power of the hybrid NG reaches approximate to 0.49 mW with a matching resistance of 8 M omega, which is 22% larger than the output power of the E-TENG. The hybrid NG can charge a lithium battery to 2.9 V in 8 h. Furthermore, the charged battery can be employed to drive an IR remote controlled light-emitting diode lamp and turn the lamp on and off. In addition, it can be combined with a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) temperature sensor to form a self-powered BLE temperature detection system. The hybrid NG shows great promise in self-powered environmental monitoring and detection applications.

One of the critical factors to support real-time ECG tracking is to guarantee monitoring system availability. Hence, this work targets battery life expansion for a 12 Lead ECG patch. ECG patch operational hours are extended by reducing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication airtime, hence reducing the overall transmission power and extending the battery life. Huffman, delta, and base-delta compression techniques are implemented on a Texas Instruments CC2650 Microcontroller Unit using different sampling rates and cardiac conditions such as normal, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation state. The performance of each encoding algorithm is evaluated in terms of compression ratio, the execution time, and power consumption of the ECG patch. Our findings show that the base-delta encoding technique outperforms other techniques and achieves 70% data compression on normal ECG data, 41% on ventricular fibrillation, and 44% on ventricular tachycardia. The execution time of base-delta encoding takes less than 25 ms execution time and saves up to 36 % of the power consumption on the MCU environment.

In this research, indoor localization based on images is investigated as an option in contrast to other indoor positioning techniques using these days. Image-based indoor positioning is more affordable than RSSI based technologies being utilized. A mobile phone camera is utilized to take the pictures of area inside the building to find the user inside the building. Sensor data from various sensors isn't required or no extra framework is required to find the client in the building utilizing indoor positioning based on an image.

However, although such assets are usually exhibited in special museum rooms, sometimes the environmental conditions may be modified, putting the materials at risk. These facts can be more severe in warehouses, where environmental conditions can vary even more. Most of the measurement sites are located in spaces that make it difficult or do not allow the handling of commercial devices for measuring multiple environmental parameters, either due to their size, energy consumption or because they cannot be connected to the internet, so there is no timely availability of information on the environmental condition in which they are found. This work presents the design and implementation of a wireless sensors network based on Bluetooth Low Energy and ZigBee, able to measure temperature, moisture, light intensity and irradiance, and particulate matter 2.5 and 10, in the different spaces where objects of cultural heritage are found. These measurements are sent to a web platform through the use of Wi-Fi or GPRS technology.

In fingerprint positioning, a site-survey is conducted in advance to build the radio map, which can be used to match radio signatures with specific locations. It takes into account the complex effects of real-environments and enables highly accurate indoor positioning. However, even in static indoor environments, the observed RSSI values are statistically fluctuated due to random wireless channels, leading to severe performance degradation of the fingerprint estimation. To address this issue, we introduce the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to fingerprint positioning with the RSSI data set (available as big data). The 3D-CNN can handle 3D spatiotemporal structures of RSSI data set and utilize the temporal fluctuations that finger-print cannot capture to enhance the positioning accuracy. The experimental results show the validity of our proposed scheme using the 3D-CNN-based fingerprint positioning, as compared to the typical positioning schemes on the basis of the feed-forward NN (FNN) and two-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN).

For instance, we have measured that real BLE scanners are not able to scan continuously even though they are configured to do so. Besides, we have also found and demonstrated that some manufacturers seem not to apply any backoff mechanism although it is mandatory. These two unexpected behaviors have a significant impact on the performance of massive wireless sensor networks based on BLE. So, it becomes necessary to characterize these and other impairments. The proposed tests are based on device current consumption measurements and their association with the information obtained from upper layers. We describe a new low-cost generic measurement setup and provide all the necessary data (configuration parameters, scripts, etc.) for applying the proposed methodology. As an example, we use it to profile the behavior of Bluetooth Low Energy devices. Furthermore, the proposed setup can also inspire researchers to characterize other wireless technology devices, like Wi-Fi, Zigbee, LoRa, etc. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ECG monitoring system plays a key role as a diagnostic tool for cardiac abnormalities. Thus it becomes important to develop a portable point of care (POC) device at an affordable price so as to monitor the patients' cardiac health without interfering in their daily schedule. We developed an end to end health care workflow comprising three important modules. Firstly, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled portable 5-lead FCC monitor system with small form factor. Next, a smart phone based android application, which receives, plots and analyzes the data sent from ECG device. Finally, a remote server where the patient data and analysis reports are stored for future reference of a professional medical practitioner. The device was tested using real time data from a rural hospital and further the obtained ECG signatures were compared with standard GE and SIEMENS ECG machines. The results were validated by a cardiologist of a super specialty hospital.	[Vishwanatham, Abhinay; Narendra, Ch; Abhishek, S.

According to the iBeacon protocol, iBeacon transmitters only do one-way broadcast communication, and thus it is difficult to authenticate the legitimacy of the transmitters. In this paper, we focus on detecting the physical attacks against iBeacon transmitters-iBeacon transmitters can be stolen, tampered, faked and reused, which interfere with the legitimate iBeacon transmission, reduce the quality of service and ultimately degrade the user experience. We develop a detection system based on Hidden Markov Model running on the server-side to detect the misbehaving iBeacon transmitters without more energy consuming. Our system achieves 85% detection accuracy on average for all physical attack actions; meanwhile it has a 5 % false alarm rate for non-attack situations in our designated trace experiments, and 100 % correct binary judgements in the random-trace experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on the iBeacon physical attack problem.

The signal is transmitted by a wearable wrist watch and received by multiple access points acting as receivers communicating via the BLE standard. It is found that while the baseline room-level accuracy is sufficiently high for practical applications in rooms separated by a wall, confusion can occur between non-adjacent rooms and thus lower localization performance. Two approaches are explored that exploit the time dimension of the data to mitigate this problem: maximum likelihood estimation in a conditional random field model, and self-supervised contrastive learning based on temporal proximity. Using a real world dataset collected in residential homes, we develop the approaches on the data collected in one residence before evaluating them on data collected in another. On the evaluation residence, we find that conditional random fields do not improve upon the baseline in terms of the weighted F1 score, while contrastive learning leads to an improvement in localization performance.

Therefore, it has become necessary to estimate the degree of congestion in each train car, both to improve passenger comfort levels and, more recently, to prevent worsening the COVID-19 pandemic infection rate. However, it is difficult to estimate the degree of congestion within a train without violating passenger privacy. The same issues are true for busses, which is noteworthy because we have previously developed and evaluated a system that can estimate the degree of congestion within a bus while protecting passenger privacy by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. In this paper, we report on our efforts to extend that system to railway use, which were conducted on actual trains in cooperation with Kintetsu Railway Co., Ltd. During this trial, we collected BLE signals and used the data to estimate congestion levels in each car using an ML regression model. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) could be estimated at accuracy levels of 5.56 and 0.27, respectively.

It also allows the monitorization of the patient's compliance to the orthosis, providing its time of use. This way, adjustments to the orthosis can be optimized, reducing the discomfort felt by the patient, increasing compliance, reducing the risk of pressure sores' formation derived from inadequate levels of pressure applied, and consequently, increasing the effectiveness of orthosis' use. Therefore, an Arduino Uno, powered by a powerbank, is used as microcontroller. Three force sensors and three temperature sensors are controlled by the microcontroller to detect the pressure and temperature. A Bluetooth Low Energy module is used to send data from the Arduino to an android application under development, which will allow healthcare professionals to consult all the information and clinical history relating to each patient, as well as allowing the patient to develop a greater awareness and sense of responsibility regarding their performance in relation to the guidelines provided by the health professional.

There are many main clinical manifestations of PD, such as tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, etc. Based on the current research on PD, the accurate and convenient detection of early symptoms is the key to detect PD. With the development of microelectronic and sensor technology, it is much easier to measure the barely noticeable tremor in just one hand for the early detection of Parkinson?s disease. In this paper, we present a smart wearable device for detecting hand tremor, in which MPU6050 (MIDI Processing Unit) consisting of a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer is used to collect acceleration and angular velocity of fingers. By analyzing the time of specific finger movements, we successfully recognized the tremor signals with high accuracy. Meanwhile, with Bluetooth 4.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy, BLE) and networking terminal ability, tremor data can be transferred to a monitoring device in real time with extremely low energy consumption. The experimental results have shown that the proposed device (smart ring) is convenient for long-term tremor detection which is vital for early detection and treatment for Parkinson?s disease.

This study proposes the design and implementation of an indoor ambient noise monitoring system to detect and record information related to indoor ambient noise in a building. The proposed system measures the noise level and estimates the source and direction of the noise. The noise level measurement is based on the sound pressure level (SPL) measurement, which is a logarithmic measure of the effective pressure of a sound relative to a reference sound pressure. Noise source localization was performed using the estimated time difference of arrival (TDOA) from the microphone array. In addition, a noise monitoring device was developed to deploy into the actual environment. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed system had a reliable accuracy for each functional unit. The error of the noise level was approximately +/- 1.5dBA and the error of the direction estimation was approximately +/- 10 degrees. As a result, these output data from the proposed system are expected to be used as important reference data for any dispute cases due to indoor ambient noise. This study also describes a Smartphone connectivity via Bluetooth Low Energy.

In order to lower the energy consumption, BLE devices have to compromise with security and privacy problems. Existing research work shows that BLE devices can be easily spoofed and leveraged to gain access to a networking system. In this paper, we propose BF-IoT, the first IoT secure communication framework for BLE-based networks that guards against device spoofing via monitoring the worklife cycles of devices. We dig into the BLE protocol stack and extract the unique network-flow features from the link layer and ATT/GATT service layer so as to generate the fingerprints for device authentication. BF-IoT provides two-phase defense against malicious entities: continuously authenticating device identity before the connection setup and during session establishment. We build a customized system to validate the effectiveness of our mechanism. We extensively evaluate BF-IoT with a dozen of different off-the-shelf commodity IoT devices which shows that the devices can be accurately authenticated via only sniffing the transmission characteristics.

Increasing tour efficiency while minimizing resources required has been studied by many researchers. The traditional multilingual human tour guides limit in the fact that, they cannot provide personalized information to every visitor because of time constraint. Also, having persons to assist tourists as a guide is expensive. Some tour guide robots and devices were presented in previous works to overcome certain limitations, but some challenges still exist. In this work, an indoor location-aware portable device is presented aiming at improving the user's experience during a tour of an indoor facility. The proposed system can provide personalized audio-visual information based on the location of the visitor, making the visitors independent of following a guide. The core of the module is a Raspberry Pi 3 with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi transceivers. Localization is performed using iBeacons, and RFID technology is used to identify certain objects. The Thingworx platform has been used as the application cloud server while YouTube has been used to present visual feedback to the user.

Three micro-power generators have already been developed as part of a smart hip prosthesis structure. This paper outlines a power management architecture for efficient harvesting of energy to supply power to modules other than those powered by current instrumented implants. Considering that it is impossible to predict the amount of energy harvested by each particular person, the proposed system also comprises an activation circuit and its ultracapacitor energy reservoir as a fourth type of energy to be used when a continuous energy source is needed. The hip prosthesis prototype has now the capability to energize more power demanding loads, intermittently or continuously, such as radio-frequency modules. The proposed architecture enables operation of a Bluetooth low energy (V4.0) embedded device (BLE112 from Bluegiga), part of a wireless body sensor network, up to 50 s, and a MSP430/eZ430-RF2500 (Texas Instruments), which uses the SimpliciTl communication protocol, up to 110 s, solely using the energy produced by one of the generators.

An innovative approach, named Automatic Detailed Diagnosis (ADD), is proposed: a non-intrusive, easy-to-install and use, low-cost and flexible system based on industrial Internet-of-Things platforms and devices. The ADD requirements and architecture were systematized from the Continuous Improvement knowledge field, and with the help of Lean Manufacturing professionals. The developed ADD concept is composed of a network of low-power devices with a variety of sensors. Colored light and vibration sensors are used to monitor equipment status, and Bluetooth low-energy and time-of-flight sensors monitor operators' movements and tasks. A cloud-based platform receives and stores the collected data. That information is retrieved by an application that builds a detailed report on operator-machine interaction. The ADD prototype was tested in a case study carried out in a mold-making company. The ADD was able to detect time performance with an accuracy between 89% and 96%, involving uptime, micro-stops, and setups. In addition, these states were correlated with the operators' movements and actions.

Technological solutions based on RFID, BIM, or UWB can reduce accidents, but they still have some limitations.The aim of the current paper is to design and evaluate a new system of "virtual fences" based on Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to avoid intrusions. First of all, the system was designed using a number of beacons, a Bayesian filter, a finite state machine, and an indicator. Secondly, its safety attributes were evaluated based on a scientific questionnaire by an expert panel following the staticized groups' methodology. Results showed that the proposal is inexpensive and easy to integrate and configure. The selected experts evaluated positively all the attributes of the system, and provided valuable insights for further improvements. From the experts' discussions, we concluded that successful adoption of this "virtual fence" system based on BLE beacons should consider the influence of factors such as cost savings, top management support, social acceptance, and compatibility and integration with existing systems, procedures, and company culture. In addition, legislation updates according to technical advances would help with successful adoption of any new safety system.

Unfortunately, the standard method to acquire ECG requires the use of materials and procedures that bears health risks for children, whose developing skin is too fragile and sensitive for prolonged and repeated application of gels, adhesives, and abrasives. Here, we introduce the development of a fully wireless, low-profile, soft cardiac monitor that obviates the need for skin preparation, gels, or adhesives, while maximizing user comfort. The hybrid construction of the device integrates a range of materials in their kinds and shapes, such as elastomers, thinfilm metal/polymer composite layers, miniature chip packages, and enables the assembly of a device whose mechanical properties are tailored for children's skin. The flexible thin-film platform is optimized for the conventional reflow soldering process, allowing for easy integration of commercially available electronic functions, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, front-end amplification and filtering, and voltage regulation. Successful in vivo applications of the device in clinical scenarios reveal the device's feasibility as a cardiac monitoring tool that captures both clinical relevance and children's health and comfort.

One of the main challenges of wireless networks, especially mesh networks, is optimizing these networks such that they provide strong and reliable communication channels with minimum resource consumption. In this paper, we design and build a wireless network planning tool which achieves successful node-to-node communication through proper node placement. This tool aids ZigBee network designers in optimizing their wireless networks. Zein tool is made to simulate the zigbee mesh network in any structure and determine the exact locations of additional nodes to be placed to insure proper operation of the mesh network. The structure can vary from different designs and applications in terms of closed spaces example: Smart homes, companies and large industries or even university campuses. The algorithm of this tool is based upon Tarjans algorithm and connecting the nodes with each other and the server node by finding the nodes wall intersections that will insure reaching the average of all the initially placed nodes one step at a time till eventually creating Zigbee node hopes and achieving both way communications.

However, the heterogeneity of the smart devices, the difficulty in automating the user-home interaction, and the poor involvement of the users in the development process of new services and applications still represent very debated issues. So, in this paper, we propose an architecture able to overcome the heterogeneity of smart devices and that can be easily extended to new future technologies. To maximize the User Experience, the proposed architecture automatically manages the environment basing on users-defined rules and on people movements, by exploiting an indoor location service based on Bluetooth Low Energy. Finally, the system also provides a simplified development tool that allows even common users to develop new services for Smart Homes and mobile applications to directly interact with the home environment. As a proof-of-concept, the first development steps are described in this paper.

But managing a large-scale beacon infrastructure presents new systems challenges, including managing battery life, replacing misplaced or stolen beacons, detecting and locating foreign or malicious beacons, and engineering beacon locations to optimize wireless resources. We study two problems whose solutions facilitate large-scale beacon network management. First, we develop a prototype system to demonstrate how conventionally static beacon advertisements can be made time-varying, and argue that time-varying advertisements can convey important device health and network state information. We then consider a fundamental question in site engineering; calculating upper limits on the spatial density of deployed beacons to optimize either the number of advertisements received, or mobile users reached. Using analysis and simulation, we show that with current wireless standards beacon separation should be at least 0.5 meters per advertisement channel. Knowledge of this bound facilitates the construction of topology design rules, and quantifies previously unknown limits on beacon density in ultra-dense deployments.

But such a system is not feasible for indoor navigation. It is often seen that customers get trapped at least ten minutes in a shopping complex searching for a particular shop. In this project, to eradicate this problem, we propose an idea of indoor navigation using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon. Here we customize our project for a shopping complex, where customers can navigate themselves to desired locations using an android application installed on their smartphone devices. In addition to navigation, we include an additional feature of online marketing system. Here the shops in the complex can advertise their offers and products using the app, in order to provide such a platform a secondary app is created where the retailers can log in and upload their ads every day. Another novel feature is a proximity advertising where offers of a particular shop popup on the phone screen when it is nearby that particular shop, thus attracting more customers.

The first project senses physiological signals; namely, photoplethysmograph (PPG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and skin temperature (SKT), in a design that is low cost, low power, and embedded in a non intrusive wristband form factor. These wearable sensors are capable of physiological monitoring, which is important when detecting implicit communication cues related to emotions and affective expressions such that affective computing is possible [1]. The device transmits data wirelessly to a PC using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. A related computer interaction has been developed to teach words to students, while monitoring their physiological signals to classify engagement. The second project aims to provide occupant specific energy feedback in real-time. To do so, it is necessary to gather information about how each occupant is using energy (i.e., how much electricity they use on a daily basis). Therefore, a sensor was designed with the capabilities of detecting energy-related events, confirming the energy-related events using a proximity sensing technique, and being small enough to be worn or carried around during day-to-day activities. The printed circuit board (PCB) designs of both projects are summarized.

Therefore, this research investigates if users can be identified without them carrying any devices or keys. In recently years, the device-free techniques using wireless signals instead of sensors and devices on body show the great potential in human detection and identification. In this paper, we present the REDoorGuard, a wireless, invisible and device-free door access system that leverage RSSI signals from Bluetooth Low Energy beacons to recognize the person who accesses the door. We evaluate REDoorGuard in two real scenarios with a total of 16 users: the first is an office room with the key lock, and the second is a meeting room with swipe card access. We exploit the characteristics of the door access and propose a two-step algorithm. We demonstrate that RFDoorGuard is capable of recognizing user actions and identifying the actual user during door access with the accuracy of 95% to 53% from a group of 2 to 10 people respectively.

Specifically, the limitation of energy injection to boost im(0) is studied, and the dc-settling process (DCS) at the dawn of the start-up for stimulating im(0) is shown. The phases of the DCS process are evaluated under different operation regions, and the theoretical implications are confirmed by detailed simulations. A design guide for an optimal DCS start-up is also proposed, allowing im(0)-boosting via simple voltage and timing controls.

More specifically, we focus on the scenario where one of the persons of interest is unable or unwilling to carry a smartphone, or any other wearable device, which frequently arises in caregiver/cared-for situations. We consider the case of indoor spaces populated with anonymous binary sensors (Passive Infrared motion sensors) and eponymous wearable sensors (smartphones interacting with Estimote beacons), and we propose a solution to the resulting sensor-fusion problem. Using a data set with sensor readings collected from one-person and two-person sessions engaged in a variety of activities of daily living, we investigate the relative merits of relying solely on anonymous sensors, solely on eponymous sensors, or on their combination. We examine how the lack of synchronization across different sensing sources impacts the quality of location estimates, and discuss how it could be mitigated without resorting to device-level mechanisms. Finally, we examine the trade-off between the sensors' coverage of the monitored space and the quality of the location estimates.

It is estimated that 95% of people with ASD have a Sensory Process Disorder (SPD). People with ASD feel the need to control what happens in their environment. However, it is inevitable that new situations occur during a persons daily life. Therefore, it is important to monitor most of the circumstances they face in an attempt to predict the appearance of disorders that end up affecting their behavior. This paper presents the first steps towards the development of a system for knowing the value and effect on the SPD of different biological and environmental parameters. To obtain those variables, two electronic devices have been designed. The first one is an electronic system for capturing environmental variables such as luminosity or humidity, which is portable and mobile. The second electronic device is a soft wearable wristband which gets biological parameters. To know the effect of those variables on the SPD, a complete software platform has been implemented. Both devices upload day-to-day data to a cloud database where the information is stored in timeseries data of different parameters. The system uses the data to learn a personalized model that is designed to manage the SPD of the user. The main novelty is the use of sensor integration, data processing and machine learning techniques to develop a system able to classify the sensory load supported by a user with ASD while performing different activities. The results obtained so far prove the feasibility of the approach.

It eliminates the ever-deepening decline in purchases made in retail stores, increases customer satisfaction and helps to create a positive brand image. Last but not least, it contributes to gaining feedback and helps to meet the company's marketing goals. Bluetooth low energy beacons, called BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), are currently one of the most widely used proximity marketing technologies. Based on the literature review, it has been identified significant shortcomings in the area of proximity marketing not only on the Slovak market but as well in general context of marketing innovations and their implication in contemporary marketing practice. Therefore, there is a need to provide revision of traditional strategic concepts with emphasis on innovative approach contained in proximity marketing concept. Up to now, the theory has been limited mainly to state the general need of incorporation of proximity marketing into managerial practice across markets but there is still missing exact detection of specific tools of proximity marketing in the scope of consumer's preferences. So, the aim of the paper is to propose recommendations for the practice of enterprises based on the survey of perception of proximity marketing activities by tools of Bluetooth technologies, with regard to the specifics of its implementation in the Slovak Republic. For this reason, a questionnaire survey of the perception of proximity marketing activities by consumers has been provided. The data used in the presented paper were obtained by our own survey carried out on the sample of 568 respondents (citizens of the Slovak Republic older than 15 years). We've statistically evaluated the given data by hypotheses verification provided by relevant statistical tests. Therefore, the important groundwork for making proposals and recommendations for business practice in the scope of implementing proximity marketing in the Slovak Republic has been created. We have found out that 1) respondents who have interest in proximity marketing show more positive buy-in response and 2) respondents who prefer to shop in the store before buying through the Internet based on a promised reward also have a higher level of loyalty. So, we can conclude that there is a great assumption that Bluetooth technology-based activities provided in the scope of proximity marketing will trigger in practice higher conversion rate in comparison with other theoretically recommended. To exploit this competitive advantage fully, there is a prior need to develop the relevant theory of proximity marketing with respect to consumer's specifics in the perception of this marketing innovation.

The sensor node allows for the monitoring of environmental parameters, in particular, temperature and humidity, with accurate and robust integrated sensors. The developed node also embeds an accelerometer, which also allows other mechanical quantities (such as tilt) to be derived. This feature can be exploited to perform structural monitoring, exploiting the processing of data history to detect permanent displacements or deformations. The node is triggered by acceleration transients; therefore, it can also generate alarms related to shocks. This feature is crucial, for instance, in the case of transportation. The developed device is low-cost and has very good performance in terms of power consumption and compactness. A reliability assessment showed excellent durability, and experimental tests proved very satisfactory robustness against working condition variations. The presented results confirm that the developed device allows for the realization of pervasive monitoring systems, in the context of the IoT paradigm, with sensor nodes devoted to the monitoring of each artwork present in a museum or in a church.

However, the wound covered by a dressing is in an 'unknown' state. Recently, researchers have focused on understanding the condition of the wound without removing the dressing. Here, we presented a flexible integrated sensing platform (FISP) that can monitor multiple indicators, including local temperature. The platform consists of a flexible sensor chip (FSC), a controlled printed circuit board (CPCB) and a customized application installed on a smartphone that can receive and display data from the sensor chip through Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 (BLE4.0) and upload real-time wound information. This device exhibits satisfactory measurement accuracy, stability, durability, skin compliance and biocompatibility. It was applied to infected wounds on the back of rabbits to reveal the temperature changes characteristic of wounds infected with different bacteria, and this information was compared with the changes in the core body temperature of animals. We found differences in the temperature among wounds infected with different pathogens and the temperature of the wound infection occurred earlier than the change in anal temperature. The combined application of the FISP and dressings might help identify the 'unknown' state of wounds in the clinic.

To satisfy the requirements of more challenging and dynamic IoT use cases, a combination of different technologies might be the best choice. Leveraging on a communication architecture that supports such multi-modal IoT systems, this paper studies the energy efficiency of a prototype device that is able to switch between Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), an LPWAN technology, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a WPAN technology. Starting from the energy consumption of the individual technologies, the overall consumption of the multi-modal device is assessed, including the effects of switching, and a prediction of the battery lifetime is made for different application contexts. Our analysis shows that for energy-critical applications, BLE is preferable over NB-IoT wherever possible. However, in case BLE is unavailable, a switch to NB-IoT can be initiated. Based on our findings, a number of approaches to use the multi-modal system in an energy efficient way has been proposed.

ACES: Automatic Configuration of Energy Harvesting Sensors with Reinforcement Learning	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet of Things; automatic configuration; reinforcement learning; smart buildings; energy harvesting; battery-less; real deployment	IOT	Many modern smart building applications are supported by wireless sensors to sense physical parameters, given the flexibility they offer and the reduced cost of deployment. However, most wireless sensors are powered by batteries today, and large deployments are inhibited by the requirement of periodic battery replacement. Energy harvesting sensors provide an attractive alternative, but they need to provide adequate quality of service to applications given the uncertainty of energy availability. We propose ACES, which uses reinforcement learning to maximize sensing quality of energy harvesting sensors for periodic and event-driven indoor sensing with available energy. Our custom-built sensor platform uses a supercapacitor to store energy and Bluetooth Low Energy to relay sensors data. Using simulations and real deployments, we use the data collected to continually adapt the sensing of each node to changing environmental patterns and transfer learning to reduce the training time in real deployments. In our 60-node deployment lasting 2 weeks, nodes stop operations only 0.1% of the time, and collection of data is comparable with current battery-powered nodes. We show that ACES reduces the node duty-cycle period by an average of 33% compared to three prior reinforcement learning techniques while continuously learning environmental changes over time.

Of the different methods, a trilateration-based Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) Beacon system has a greater potential as it provides specific location information. However, the feasibility of implementing a trilateration-based BLE Beacon system has not yet been validated in space-usage analysis in the NWW office. The present study thus aimed to establish whether such a system would be suitable for the purpose. Two sets of experiments were performed in an open-plan office in order to evaluate system accuracy. The present study used two indexes: Distance Difference (DD) and Accuracy Rate of User-Identified Location Estimation (AR). The best average DD was 0.7 m at desk 5 in the first experiment, which is promising. However, the overall experimental DDs were 1.63 m and 1.93 m, while both DD and AR showed significant variance between desks. These findings indicate that system accuracy and consistency are not yet sufficient for space usage analysis in the NWW office. Accordingly, to enhance system accuracy and consistency it will be essential to develop strategies for optimal system deployment and to combine them with other methods.

Despite demonstrating significant benefits in providing low power transmission and massive connectivity, very few of these technologies directly connect to the Internet. Recent advances demonstrate the viability of direct communication among heterogeneous IoT devices with incompatible physical layers. These techniques, however, require modifications in transmission power or time, which may affect the media access control layer behaviors in legacy networks. In this paper, we argue that the frequency domain can serve as a free side channel with minimal interruptions to legacy networks. To this end, we propose DopplerFi, a communication framework that enables a two-way communication channel between BLE and Wi-Fi by injecting artificial Doppler shifts, which can be decoded by sensing the patterns in the Gaussian frequency shift keying demodulator and channel state information. The artificial Doppler shifts can be compensated for by the inherent frequency synchronization module and thus have a negligible impact on legacy communications. Our evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf BLE chips and 802.11-compliant testbeds has demonstrated that DopplerFi can achieve a throughput of up to 6.5 Kb/s at the cost of merely less than 0.8% throughput loss.

It has recently been amended with Bluetooth Mesh, which promises secure low energy multi-hop wireless connectivity. Even older Bluetooth devices can become part of the network with a software-only upgrade. Bluetooth Mesh claims to be suitable for building large-scale multi-hop sensor networks with thousands of devices and up to 127 hops. In particular, it introduces the friendship concept, allowing low power Internet-of-Things devices to save energy by going into sleep mode, while their associated friend node caches their packets. In this paper, we show that the security model underlying the friendship concept introduces a number of simplifying assumptions that can be harnessed against the Bluetooth Mesh network. We demonstrate three fundamental vulnerabilities in the security model that lead to denial-of-service and impersonation attacks. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that our denial-of-service attack significantly affects the battery life of power-constrained Internet-of-Things devices from a normal duration of two years to just few days. In addition, we introduce btlemesh, an open-source tool to analyze Bluetooth Mesh and perform the aforementioned security tests in practice. Finally, we discuss possible countermeasures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

To realize the remote long-term ECG monitoring, a low-power wireless wearable ECG monitoring system is proposed in this paper. The wearable telemetry ECG monitoring system includes three parts, respectively, ECG monitoring device, mobile phone, and the cloud server. The ECG monitoring device, abbreviated as ECGM, is designed based on BMD101 sensor chip and CC2640R2F wireless MCU. The ECGM collects ECG signals from the fabric electrodes adhered to users' chest, preprocesses the signal to eliminate the injected noise, and then sends the digital output data to users' hand-held mobile phones through Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The phones are in charge of ECG classification and uploading both original and processed ECG data to the cloud server. The cloud server stores users' ECG data, accounts for huge calculation in ECG processing & diagnosing, and provides telemetry monitoring service for cardiologists. Users, namely patients, view ECG on their phones and acquire treatment advices from both machine and cardiologists. The novelty of the system lie in the combination of low-power ECG sensor chip and BLE chip, and thereby it features ultra-low power consumption and high signal quality.

Each technology has said that it is superior to other technologies; however, there is no winner as of now. Recent trend is that whoever gets the most users in the market wins. Thus, companies who share mutual understanding began to organize consortiums to develop a common standard technology for IoT. Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) is a recent case. To disseminate an IoT standard widely, it is very important to keep compatibility with existing technologies already available in the market. One of OCF's major goal is bridging to other ecosystems such as AllJoyn, oneM2M, etc. On the other hand, not only IoT ecosystems but traditional connectivity technologies, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-wave etc., should also be considered. We call them "legacy devices" in this paper. Legacy device is defined as "IoT devices that work on their own protocol stack and have been sold in the market. They are independent of any IoT ecosystems such as OCF, AllJoyn etc.". In this paper, we propose how OCF devices can be bridged to legacy IoT devices. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device is chosen as the first target legacy IoT device. Reference implementation codes for bridging based on IoTivity is described too.

J	Lee, CC; Xu, DG; Chan, GR				Lee, C. C.; Xu, Degang; Chan, George			Low-cost System with Handheld Analyzer for Optimizing the Position of Indoor Base Stations	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Automatic Testing Equipment; Indoor Base Stations; IoT; Wireless Handheld Devices		In this paper, an automatic system of locating the indoor area with weak or no mobile signal was proposed and demonstrated experimentally by using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Nowadays, the technicians of mobile services providers need to go along with numerous heavy equipment to measure and record the mobile signal strength at outside environment. Recently, there are systems proposed to do such measurement at outdoor area by using the IoT technology automatically. However, these works could not be applied in the indoor area since there are difficulties to do the indoor mapping and positioning. In this work, the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was used to tackle these two difficulties. After a proper placement of BLE in the testing site, while the technician walk around with a handheld analyzer, the data can be obtained accordingly for further analysis in the proposed system which includes the construction of floor plan, detection of mobile signal strength and suggestion of indoor base stations. The gift wrapping and centroid algorithms were used during the analysis. The experimental results showed that the proposed system successfully demonstrated the indoor mapping, positioning of weak mobile signal area and suggestion of indoor base stations for the normal rectangular rooms with an area of 100 m(2) on single floor.

A Model Transformation Approach for Detecting Distancing Violations in Weighted Graphs	COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Model-driven engineering (MDE); Internet-of-Things (IoTs); model transformation; edge computing; system design; Neo4j graph databases		This work presents the design of an Internet of Things (IoT) edge-based system based on model transformation and complete weighted graph to detect violations of social distancing measures in indoor public places. A wireless sensor network based on Bluetooth Low Energy is introduced as the infrastructure of the proposed design. A hybrid model transformation strategy for generating a graph database to represent groups of people is presented as a core middle-ware layer of the detecting system's proposed architectural design. A Neo4j graph database is used as a target implementation generated from the proposed transformational system to store all captured real-time IoT data about the distances between individuals in an indoor area and answer user predefined queries, expressed using Neo4j Cypher, to provide insights from the stored data for decision support. As proof of concept, a discrete-time simulation model was adopted for the design of a COVID-19 physical distancing measures case study to evaluate the introduced system architecture. Twenty-one weighted graphs were generated randomly and the degrees of violation of distancing measures were inspected. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed system design to detect violations of COVID-19 physical distancing measures within an enclosed area.

The varied human activities and the way they are executed at individual level are the main challenges to be recognized in human behavior modeling. This paper proposes a novel methodology that recognizes human activities from the behavior of individuals in a smart home environment. The dataset considered in this work is captured using Bluetooth low energy, a popular technology for indoor localization. The proposed framework is a binary cuckoo search-based stacking model that collectively exploits multiple base learners for human activities recognition from the gathered accelerometer sensors data mounted on wearable and mobile devices. The work is tested on the newly developed SPHERE dataset to recognize user activities in smart home environment. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms MLP, DT, KNN, SGD, NB, RF, LR and SVM classifiers on the dataset and gives a high predictive accuracy value of 93.77% via a tenfold cross-validation. The proposed approach gives a better performance at the expense of more computation time, that is, due to the integration of cuckoo search metaheuristic algorithm.

High power density is achieved via a unique combination of lithographically-patterned stretchable electronic framework together with screen-printed, densely-packed three-dimensional carbon-nanotube-based bioanode and cathode array arranged in a stretchable "island-bridge" configuration. The E-BFC maintains its performance even under repeated strains of 50%, and is stable for two days. When applied directly to the skin of human subjects, the E-BFC generates similar to 1 mW during exercise. The E-BFC is able to power conventional electronic devices, such as a light emitting diode and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. This is the first example of powering a BLE radio by a wearable biofuel cell. Successful generation of high power density under practical conditions and powering of conventional energy-intense electronic devices represents a major step forward in the field of soft, stretchable, wearable energy harvesting devices.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is considered as the main-stream technology to perform identification and localization/tracking in IoT applications. Indoor localization applications within smart cities, typically, start by observing messages transmitted by BLE beacons and then utilization of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to provide location estimates. RSSI signals are, however, prone to significant fluctuations. The main challenge is that multipath fading and drastic fluctuations in the indoor environment result in complex non-Gaussian RSSI measurements, necessitating the need to smooth RSSIs for development of BLE-based localization applications. In contrary to existing solutions, where RSSIs are assumed to have normal statistical properties, in this paper, a Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF) approach is designed to more realistically model the non-Gaussian nature of RSSIs. To maintain acceptable computational load, the number of components in the GSF is collapsed into a single Gaussian term with a novel Wasserstein Distance (WD)-Based Gaussian Mixture Reduction (GMR) algorithm. The simulation results based on real collected RSSI signals confirm the success of the proposed WD-based GSF framework compared to its conventional counterparts.

Unlike traditional visualization methods, Augmented Reality (AR) inserts virtual objects and information directly into digital representations of the real world, which makes these objects and data more easily understood and interactive. However, effective AR-GIS systems and rich spatial information visualization is still a challenging task. In addition, indoor AR-GIS systems are further impeded by the limited capacity of these systems to detect and display geometry and semantic information. To address this problem, a novel AR and indoor map fusion method is proposed that automatically registers spatial information onto a live camera view of a mobile phone. We fused Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) localization techniques to track the camera positions. The proposed algorithm extracts and matches a bounding box of the indoor map to a real world scene. We render the indoor map and semantic information into the real world, based on the real-time computed spatial relationship between the indoor map and live camera view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach accurately and richly visualizes spatial information. Our augmented reality and indoor map fusion technique effectively links rich indoor spatial information to real world scenes in AR integrated GIS.

In particular, this paper leverages Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons to realize a PBS system which comprises a number of Proximities of Interest (Pots). We define a PoI as an object or area which is associated with a beacon such that each PoI can announce their presence implicitly through the beacon's signal. However, under a sparse beacon network condition in which some beacons associated with some Pots are malfunction or their batteries die before the scheduled maintenance, a receiver (e.g., smartphone) might fail to return the target PoI correctly. In view of the quality degradation in consequence to the sparse condition, we refine the performance of classical compressive sensing based algorithm with a generalized similarity filter. The effects of different similarity measures on proximity detection performance are also investigated. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the detection accuracy as compared to the conventional compressive sensing based algorithm. Specifically, Chordal-based similarity filter achieves substantial improvement in comparison with Mahalanobis and Euclidean-based similarity computation.

We derive the analytical expressions for the performances of differential inductively-degenerated common-source (CS) LNA and cross-coupled common-gate (CG) LNA with on-chip transformers to present their design considerations. The derived expressions provide the minimum requirement for the quality factor of the inductor and the optimum inductance for the minimum noise figure (NF) of the LNA. Both the LNAs with inter-winding symmetric octagonal transformers are designed for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) receivers with a 65-nm CMOS process. Simulations show that the differential CS and CG LNAs achieve vertical bar S-21 vertical bar of 20.4 dB and 20.9 dB, and N F of 5.18 dB and 4.55 dB at 2.45 GHz, respectively, with a power consumption of 2.8 mW from a 0.7-V supply.

J	Iannizzotto, G; Lo Bello, L; Nucita, A				Iannizzotto, Giancarlo; Lo Bello, Lucia; Nucita, Andrea			Improving BLE-Based Passive Human Sensing with Deep Learning	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth; BLE; wireless passive human sensing; deep learning		Passive Human Sensing (PHS) is an approach to collecting data on human presence, motion or activities that does not require the sensed human to carry devices or participate actively in the sensing process. In the literature, PHS is generally performed by exploiting the Channel State Information variations of dedicated WiFi, affected by human bodies obstructing the WiFi signal propagation path. However, the adoption of WiFi for PHS has some drawbacks, related to power consumption, large-scale deployment costs and interference with other networks in nearby areas. Bluetooth technology and, in particular, its low-energy version Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), represents a valid candidate solution to the drawbacks of WiFi, thanks to its Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) mechanism. This work proposes the application of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DNN) to improve the analysis and classification of the BLE signal deformations for PHS using commercial standard BLE devices. The proposed approach was applied to reliably detect the presence of human occupants in a large and articulated room with only a few transmitters and receivers and in conditions where the occupants do not directly occlude the Line of Sight between transmitters and receivers. This paper shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the most accurate technique found in the literature when applied to the same experimental data.

The BLE patch antenna works in the personal area network and the 433 MHz antenna works in the Wide area network. The BLE patch antenna is very useful because of its low data rate, extended sleep periods as this leads to very low consumption of power. Both the antennas used in this paper are simulated keeping in mind the effects of radiation on the human body. So, even though mobile multimedia has many advantages but due to data transmission, heat generated (or heat radiated) from these sensory devices are high and results in heat dissipation. The SAR value obtained for BLE antenna is 0.90337 W/kg and gain is 3.39 dB. The SAR value of 433 MHz antenna is 0.09021 W/kg and gain is 7.66 dB. So, the SAR values were analysed and optimized for the designing of the above stated antennas.

It represents an excellent solution for commercial and industrial lighting applications, though it is still evolving. One of the biggest challenges of the Bluetooth mesh network is the improvement of confirmation messages reception. In a Bluetooth mesh network, determining the Status of the received messages is a critical aspect that can generate unexpected issues when multiple devices respond simultaneously, as it may occur in some lighting applications. This behavior can reduce the probability of message delivery due to collisions, especially when the number of devices in the network increases. This article aims to improve the reliability in receiving confirmation messages in a Bluetooth mesh network by proposing a new technique of spreading Status overtime. To evaluate the proposed technique's performance, we compare our technique with a Bluetooth mesh network with standard configuration (SC) using real nodes experimental setup. We evaluated our results in terms of packet-loss rate, obtaining 98.84% of the Status received for the network with our optimized configuration and 96.98% for those with the SC. Finally, an in-depth performance evaluation method for the analysis of the lost Status was also conducted.

Wireless IoT Motion-Recognition Rings and a Paper Keyboard	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Wearable sensors; wireless IoT ring; keystroke recognition; virtual keyboard; micro IMU	GESTURE RECOGNITION; TRACKING	In this paper, we present a new scheme for implementing virtual keyboards, which uses only two to four motion-recognition rings per hand and a two-dimensional keyboard template (e.g., an A4 size paper with printed key positions). It has the benefit of portability, customizability, and low-cost when compared with existing approaches. Essentially, we have shown that wearing two wireless IoT rings on the middle phalanges of two fingers of each hand, users can input the alphabetic characters into a computing device by typing on a flat paper on a desk, and potentially in mid-air. We have demonstrated that two rings are sufficient in capturing the gestures and motions of all fingers in a typing hand for keystrokes recognition. A single wireless IoT ring, which weighs 7.8 grams, consists of a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) unit, a micro inertial measurement unit (mIMU), and a cell battery. The 3-axes attitude angles and the Z-axis acceleration of each ring are adopted as the features for keystroke recognition. The overall keystroke recognition accuracy rate can reach as high as 94.8% when two IoT rings are worn by a user on each hand; this accuracy rate increases to 98.6%, when four rings are worn on each typing hand.

As with new ideas that hold immense potential, the optimism of IoT has also exaggerated the underlying technologies well before they can mature into a sustainable ecosystem. While 6LoWPAN has emerged as a disruptive technology that brings IP capability to networks of resource constrained devices, a suitable radio technology for this device class is still debatable. In the recent past, Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 stack -has surfaced as an appealing alternative that provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets). When Bluetooth 4.0 was first released, it was not targeted for IP-connected devices but for communication between two neighboring peers. However, the latest release of Bluetooth 4.2 offers features that makes Bluetooth LE a competitive candidate among the available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space. In this paper, we discuss the novel features of Bluetooth LE and its applicability in 6LoWPAN networks. We also highlight important research questions and pointers for potential improvement for its greater impact.

Effective power management signals and controlling the mode of operation to reduce the need for full fidelity ECG signal. This work studies the impact of the base-delta compression technique for different cardiac conditions on power consummation. It also aims to evaluate operational strategies and their effect on the battery life when the ECG patch can switch between different operating modes (e.g., varying the number of leads according to the cardiac conditions). We use a binary classifier to inform the decision of switching between different operational strategies. Both scenarios are evaluated in terms of execution time, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication airtime, power consumption, and energy-saving ratios on a Texas Instruments CC2650 Micro-controller Unit (MCU). We compare the performance of the base-delta compression and changing the mode of operation scenarios on various cardiac abnormalities. Performance evaluation shows that operational strategies outperforms data compression in power saving for normal ECG readings by a double fold. In contrast, operational strategies incurs an additional overhead of 1011 ms during an abnormal status. However, base-delta satisfies the embedded platform constraints on execution time and airtime with 25 ms and 20 ms, respectively in the MCU environment.

To monitor and cure these disabilities, sensors able to monitor the patient for long-term measurement during daily life and able to provide real-time feedback are required. There are only a few wearable systems that are capable to acquire muscle activity (sEMG) and posture at the same time. Moreover, previously reported systems do not target back sensor and typically comprise bulky uncomfortable solutions. In this paper, we present a new wearable sensor network that is designed to measure muscle activity and posture specialized for back measurement. Special care was taken to propose a discrete and comfortable solution. The prototype only measures 3.1 mm in thickness on the spine, making this sensor system the thinnest and lightest one in the literature to our best knowledge. After testing, it was shown that the sensor system is able to acquire two surface electromyography signals concurrently, to gather acceleration and rotation speed from the patient's lower back, and to transmit data to a computer or a smartphone via serial communication or Bluetooth low energy for a few hours for later processing and analysis.

Hand hygiene is considered as an effective measure to prevent cross infections in hospital environments. Research efforts in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) can provide reliable edge-based solutions in hospitals to prevent HAI by adopting sensing, networking, and computing technologies. In this paper, we present a prototype for autonomous hand hygiene tracking combining different IoT technologies, which can be applied in healthcare environments to monitor hand hygiene activities and better prevent HAIs. The system can record hand-washing activities and provide prompt feedback if the hand-washing is not performed as required using wearable devices and smart dispensers. Collected data are transferred to a gateway via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Long Range (LoRa) wireless technologies for long-range network coverage. The hand-washing data are processed at the edge of the network (i.e., router and gateway) to provide low-latency feedback. The data can also be forwarded to a cloud server for storage, analysis, and visualization. The proposed hand hygiene tracking prototype has been tested and evaluated under different scenarios in a mock ward, demonstrating its applicability in hospital environments.

Noise-Resilient Acoustic Low Energy Beacon for Proximity-Based Indoor Positioning Systems	SENSORS			English	Article						acoustic beacon; proximity-based positioning; location based services		Proximity-Based Indoor Positioning Systems (PIPSs) are a simple to install alternative in large facilities. Besides, these systems have a reduced computational cost on the mobile device of those users who do not continuously demand a high location accuracy. This work presents the design of an Acoustic Low Energy (ALE) beacon based on the emission of inaudible Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) signals. This coding scheme provides high robustness to in-band noise, thus ensuring a reliable detection of the beacon at a practical range, after pulse compression. A series of experimental tests have been carried out with nine different Android devices to study the system performance. These tests have shown that the ALE beacon can be detected at one meter distance with signal-to-noise ratios as low as -12 dB. The tests have also demonstrated a detection rate above 80% for reception angles up to 50 degrees with respect to the beacon's acoustic axis at the same distance. Finally, a study of the ALE beacon energy consumption has been conducted demonstrating comparable power consumption to commercial Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Besides, the ALE beacon search can save up to 9% more battery of the Android devices than the BLE beacon scanning.

Hospitals typically provide their staff with smartphones to facilitate internal communication and access to hospital services. The key contribution of PMD-Track lies in the use of smartphones replacing expensive stationary gateways scattered across a hospital, acting as mobile gateways associated with a front-end that allows staff to quickly find PMDs. Thus, employees walking nearby tagged PMDs - as they perform daily activities constantly help to automatically update these PMDs' locations in a live inventory tracker allowing to retrieve up-to-date information. PMDs equipped with traditional Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags will update a backend service with the location of recently spotted tags and display information concerning their position in real-time. Different PMD types can issue alerts according to the type of their mobility (i.e., considering that portable devices can be more or less "dynamic"). Thus, it is expected that PMD-Track will enable hospitals to make efficient use of their PMDs in emergency situations, such as a pandemic or eventual natural disasters, where a sudden increase in demand can now be foreseen.

Because IoT communications are often narrowband, efficient localization can be achieved by deducing the device position from the estimated signal Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) at multiple arrays of antennas. It has recently been shown that significant accuracy gains can further be obtained by iterating between the AOA estimation and multi-lateration steps. However, the existing method relies on the knowledge of the transmitted signal (Data-Aided (DA) estimation) which makes it impractical for narrowband communications where the preamble is short. Non-Data-Aided (NDA) estimation is recommended to improve the positioning accuracy for low capacity IoT sensors. This paper proposes an NDA iterative (NDA-It) algorithm using AOA measurements to determine the position of an IoT sensor. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the DA-It in a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) context because it can use a much higher number of samples (snapshots); however, it needs more iterations to converge. The computational complexity analysis proves the competitiveness of the proposed NDA-It. The performance of the algorithms is further investigated in multipath and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation environments. Finally, an experimental setup is built to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Since most of the energy consumption in a building is from the air condition system, the air conditioners in a building are often controlled through a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. To control each HVAC unit individually, the locations of HVAC units are essential information. However, manual location identification requires significant labor for a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed in a building. In this paper, we propose a Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based HVAC unit localization method. We assume that a BLE module is attached to each HVAC unit, and then the locations of HVAC units can be estimated using the signal strength of the BLE module, which is observed by site survey of a worker. Our method requires a floor plan containing the physical locations of HVAC units and matches BLEs to the locations on the floor plan by estimation. The site survey can be carried out without visiting the entire site. Instead, the worker is required to follow several walking paths, which reduces the labor cost and time. We evaluated our method in a real office building with 26 BLEs on two floors. The results show that 70% of the BLEs were matched to their correct physical locations.

Moreover, long sensing times, complexity, and inability to track concurrent interference strongly inhibit their applicability in most IoT deployments. Motivated by the increasing need for on-device IDI for wireless coexistence, we develop a lightweight and efficient method targeting interference identification already at the level of single interference bursts. Our method exploits real-time extraction of envelope and model-aided spectral features, specifically designed considering the physical properties of the signals captured with COTS hardware. We adopt manifold supervised-learning (SL) classifiers ensuring suitable performance and complexity tradeoff for the IoT platforms with different computational capabilities. The proposed IDI method is capable of real-time identification of IEEE 802.11b/g/n, 802.15.4, 802.15.1, and Bluetooth Low Energy wireless standards, enabling isolation and extraction of standard-specific traffic statistics even in the case of heavy concurrent interference. We perform an experimental study in real environments with heterogeneous interference scenarios, showing 90%-97% burst identification accuracy. Meanwhile, the lightweight SL methods, running online on wireless sensor networks-COTS hardware, ensure sub-ms identification time and limited performance gap from machine-learning approaches.

Without ETA information, it is very difficult for the general public to plan their journey effectively. This paper proposes an innovative IoT solution to track the location of buses without requiring the deployment of a GPS device. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity beacon to track the journey of a bus by deploying an Estimote location beacon on the bus. BLE detection devices (Raspberry Pi 3) are installed at selected bus stops along the bus route to detect the arrival of buses. Once detected, the location of the bus is submitted to a cloud server to compute the bus ETAs. A field trial is currently being conducted in Johor, Malaysia in collaboration with a local bus operator on one single bus route. Our test results showed that the detection of BLE beacons is very accurate and it is feasible to track the location of buses without using a GPS device in a cost effective way. A mobile app - myBusz has been developed as well to allow for passengers to check the bus ETA in real-time.

In this paper, we propose an indoor location estimation method for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using end-to-end LSTM neural network. We focus on large-scale exhibition where is a tough environment for wireless indoor location estimation due to signal strength instability. To achieve higher accuracy, deep learning based methods are proposed rather than trilateration or fingerprint. Existing deep learning based methods estimate the location from the probabilities using the difference of query signal strength and autoencoder-reconstruction of it. Proposed method adopts end-to-end location estimation, which means the neural network takes a time-series of signal strength and outputs the estimated location at the latest time in the input time-series. We also build a loss function which takes how a person walks into account. Considering the difficulty of data collection within a short preparation term of an exhibition, the data generated by a simple simulation is used in the training phase before training with a small amount of real data. As a result, the estimation accuracy is average of 1.92m, using the data collected in GEXPO exhibition in Miraikan, Tokyo. Proposed method outperforms our previous trilateration based method's 4.51m average.

Therefore, a system that dynamically directs people to the safest exit is needed to reduce congestion, speed up the evacuation process and to save lives. This paper presents a system that uses IoT technologies to track location of the fire and building occupants, and then directs the occupants smartly towards a safe exit. The system uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons for indoor localization using the occupant's mobile phones. The system also tracks areas of danger using smoke and temperature sensors. For resiliency in face of a fire, the system uses multiple networks including WiFi and the DigiMesh. A publish/subscribe architecture using an MQTT broker was implemented. In case of a fire, occupants can use a smart mobile application that provides the occupants with a live map of the current danger levels within the building. In addition, smart exit signs are deployed throughout the building that dynamically change their state based on location of the fire to guide the occupants to safety. Real-time information gathered from sensors and occupants is also provided to emergency response services. The proposed system can be scaled to a city-wide emergency network.

This work focuses on the caracterization and prevention of sedentary lifestyles. A sedentary behavior is defined as "any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure of 1.5 METs (Metabolic Equivalent) or less while in a sitting or reclining posture". Objective: To propose a method for sedentary behaviors classification using a smartphone and Bluetooth beacons considering different types of classification models: personal, hybrid or impersonal. Results: Following the CRISP-DM methodology, a method based on a two-layer approach for the classification of sedentary behaviors is proposed. Using data collected from a smartphones' accelerometer, gyroscope and barometer; the first layer classifies between performing a sedentary behavior and not. The second layer of the method classifies the specific sedentary activity performed using only the smartphone's accelerometer and barometer data, but adding indoor location data, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. To improve the precision of the classification, both layers implemented the Random Forest algorithm and the personal model. Conclusions: This study presents the first available method for the automatic classification of specific sedentary behaviors. The layered classification approach has the potential to improve processing, memory and energy consumption of mobile devices and wearables used.

J	Yang, S; Sun, C; Kim, Y				Yang, Shangyi; Sun, Chao; Kim, Youngok			Indoor 3D Localization Scheme Based on BLE Signal Fingerprinting and 1D Convolutional Neural Network	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						1D conventional neural network; 3D localization; indoor positioning; BLE signal		Indoor localization schemes have significant potential for use in location-based services in areas such as smart factories, mixed reality, and indoor navigation. In particular, received signal strength (RSS)-based fingerprinting is used widely, given its simplicity and low hardware requirements. However, most studies tend to focus on estimating the 2D position of the target. Moreover, it is known that the fingerprinting scheme is computationally costly, and its positioning accuracy is readily affected by random fluctuations in the RSS values caused by fading and the multipath effect. We propose an indoor 3D localization scheme based on both fingerprinting and a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of using the conventional fingerprint matching method, we transform the 3D positioning problem into a classification problem and use the 1D CNN model with the RSS time-series data from Bluetooth low-energy beacons for classification. By using the 1D CNN with the time-series data from multiple beacons, the inherent drawback of RSS-based fingerprinting, namely, its susceptibility to noise and randomness, is overcome, resulting in enhanced positioning accuracy. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we developed a 3D positioning system and performed comprehensive tests, whose results confirmed that the scheme significantly outperforms the conventional common spatial pattern classification algorithm.

TrojanSense was developed with the goal of supporting initiatives to improve campus community engagement on issues of occupant thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and equity in the environmental control of university buildings. TrojanSense is an open-loop system, where outcomes pairing thermal preference and concurrent indoor temperature measurements are analyzed and reported with room-level resolution on a Campus Thermal Preference Map to support building operators and to inform campus policies related to thermal comfort and energy efficiency. The TrojanSense framework integrates wireless Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity beacons embedded in campus buildings to sense temperature and to automatically solicit occupant feedback using proximity-based prompts. Data from an exploratory pilot study are analyzed to examine the applicability of the approach for developing predictive models of thermal preference and for placing existing space conditioning assumptions in context with occupant feedback. Results demonstrate the potential for TrojanSense to identify overcooling using objective and subjective measures, increase the accuracy of predictions of thermal preference, and provide greater insight into the impact of outdoor weather on thermal preference to inform future climate-responsive control strategies.

Biases in the recommender systems are not transparent to the user and lock-in effects might make it inconvenient for the user to switch providers. In this paper, we present the concept, design, and implementation of MobRec, a mobile platform that decentralizes the data collection, data storage, and recommendation process. MobRec's architecture does not need any backend and solely consists of the users' smartphones, which already contain the users' preferences and ratings. Being in proximity in public places or public transportation, data is exchanged in a device-to-device manner, building local databases that can recommend new items. One of biggest challenges of such a system is the implementation of unobtrusive device-to-device data exchange on off-the-shelf Android devices and iPhones. MobRec facilitates such data exchange, building on Google Nearby Messages with Bluetooth Low Energy. We achieve the successful exchange of data within 3 to 4 minutes, making it suitable for the described scenario. We demonstrate the feasibility of decentralized recommender systems and provide blueprints for the development of seamless multi-platform device-to-device communication.

GRNN and KF framework based real time target tracking using PSOC BLE and smartphone	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						General Regression Neural Network (GRNN); Target tracking; PSOC BLE nodes		With the advancements in the mobile devices having Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capability, the BLE based indoor target localization is the recent trend. The majority of indoor localization methods generally rely on traditional simple techniques such as trilateration or angulation. However significant localization errors are involved with these techniques due to highly nonlinear relationship between RSSI and distance because of issues such as NLOS, multipath propagation. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) with a one pass learning capability, is well known for its ability to train quickly. This paper proposes an application of GRNN as an alternative to these traditional techniques to obtain first location estimates of moving person using a hybrid network of PSOC BLE nodes and smartphone, which are further refined using Kalman filtering (KF) framework. Two algorithms namely, GRNN + Kalman filter and GRNN + Unscented Kalman filter are proposed in this research work. The GRNN is trained with the RSSI values from PSOC BLE nodes at various locations and the corresponding actual 2-D locations of the given monitoring area. The real time experiments prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over the traditional approach in the context of NLOS, multipath propagation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In indoor environments, however, no system is close to achieving a similar level of ubiquity, with existing solutions offering different trade-offs in terms of accuracy, robustness and cost. In this paper, we develop a multi-modal posit" g system, targeted at smartphones, which aims to get the best out of each of its constituent modalities. More precisely, we combine Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons, round-trip-lime (RTT) enabled WW1 access points and the smartphone's inertial measurement unit (IMU) to provide a cheap robust localization system that, unlike fingerprinting methods, requires no pre-training. To do this, we use a probabilistic algorithm based on a conditional random field (CRF). We show how to incorporate sparse visual information to improve the accuracy of our system, using pose estimation from pre scanned visual landmarks, to calibrate the system online. Our method achieves an accuracy of around 2 meters on two realistic datasets, outperforming other distance-based localization approaches. We also c. pare our approach with an ultra-wideband (UWB) system. While we do not match the performance of UWB, our system is cheap, smartphone compatible and provides satisfactory performance for many applications.

A 2.4-GHz BAW-Based Transceiver for Wireless Body Area Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC 2010)	FEB 07-11, 2010	San Francisco, CA	IEEE		Body-area network (BAN); BAW resonators; low power; phase analog-to-digital converter (ADC); RFIC; RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS); wireless sensor networks		This paper presents a BAW-based transceiver targeting wireless networks for biomedical applications. The use of high-Q microelectromechanical-systems resonators brings interesting benefits to the fundamental building blocks of the frequency synthesis, receiver, and transmitter and allows achieving at the same time low-power consumption, improved phase noise, and high selectivity in the receiver and transmitter paths. In the baseband, the power consumption is minimized thanks to the use of a phase analog-to-digital converter (ADC) which directly quantizes the phase of the received signal instead of using two separate amplitude ADCs. A complete wireless node composed of the transceiver integrated circuit (IC) and a microprocessing IC, both integrated in a standard digital 0.18-mu m complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology are described and validated by measurement results. The RF carrier phase noise is -136.2 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset. The transmitter demonstrates 1-Mb/s Gaussian frequency-shift keying modulation at an output power of 5.4 dBm with an overall current of 35 mA, in compliance with Bluetooth and Bluetooth low energy output spectrum requirements. At the receiver, further investigations are needed to find the origins of an unexpected sensitivity of -75 dBm at 200 kb/s.

In this work, we propose a low power multi-sensors hardware-software co-design for extremely long shelf life, and a long operating lifecycle. The designed device is based on a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system on chip (SoC) to exchange data with a gateway. NFC has been chosen to wake up the device without adding any additional power consumption. The system on a chip includes an ARM Cortex-M4F core to further process the information achieving low latency and high energy efficiency. The device hosts a temperature and humidity sensor used to monitor the storage conditions, and an accelerometer is used for condition and activity monitoring. This paper provides a proof-of-concept approach to continuously assess the usage of a power tool and detect potential mis-usages, e.g., drops. The architecture, thought to be flexible, can host both traditional signal processing and novel tiny machine learning workloads, offering a future-proof platform for several application scenarios. Experimental results highlight the advanced processing capabilities at low power consumption enabling a long lifetime of up to 4 years with a small coin battery.

A combination of image and EMG data enables a more effective way to quantitatively evaluate the recover level of patients with movement disorders, such as post-stroke patients. This paper proposed a wireless multiple-mode human behavior evaluation system enables simultaneously acquisition of multiple image sensor data and acquisition of EMG data from different muscles. Several wireless wearable EMG sensor nodes are attached to different muscles-of-interest over the body. Each EMG sensor node features an individual acquisition channel. The collected data are transferred through Bluetooth Low Energy. Each EMG node features a size of 2cm x 3cm x 1cm with a weight of 16 gram and a battery life of 20 hours. Two Wi-Fi based wireless image sensors are used. A convolutional neural network based human pose estimation method is proposed to track the skeleton motion features from the captured streams. The fully wireless nature guarantees the usability and flexibility of the proposed system. A data collection and remote analysis platform is also developed for remote support. The proposed system has been tested on patients recovering from stroke.

These systems, in particular, Passive Keyless Entry and Start systems (PKES), allow drivers to automatically unlock their vehicles by standing within one meter of the vehicle while carrying a key fob. Traditional key fobs adopt the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) wireless communication technology. Yet, due to the restricted processing capacity of the key fobs and the vulnerabilities of RFID technology, these systems are subject to relay attack. In this paper, we propose a Context-based Secure Keyless Entry System (CSKES) that adopts BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) as a wireless communication technology and utilizes multiple context-based physical security features, namely, RSSI (Receiving Signal Strength Indicator), RTT (Round-Trip Time), GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates, and Wi-Fi access point lists, to precisely identify the close proximity of a vehicle to its corresponding key fob. This multi-feature proximity identification system is highly efficient to mitigate classic relay attacks. We first introduce the implementation of the proposed system. Then we evaluate the system performance using three classification models with a dataset collected from normal and abnormal use cases. The results show that the proposed Context-based Secure Keyless Entry System demonstrates great efficiency in identifying physical proximity and preventing classic relay attack.

J	Lee, SH; Lim, KS				Lee, Seoung-Hyeon; Lim, Kyung-Soo			Indoor positioning method using BITON and linear Kalman filter	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Indoor positioning service; Beacon; BITON; LKF; UNIWAY		This study proposes an indoor positioning system using the BITON algorithm, a linear Kalman filter (LKF), and beacons. A beacon is an indoor positioning device that uses Bluetooth low-energy technology. Indoor location-based services that use existing beacons provide information to adjacent devices in specific areas, such as shopping and sightseeing locations. When indoor location-based services are active, and beacons are installed in many areas, space-based services become important. In space-based services, it is important to improve the accuracy of user locations, which are calculated using information from the beacon. In this paper, we propose a method for improving user positioning accuracy indoors using BITON and LKF. First, we analyze the characteristics of a beacon signal (with fading) and calculate a correction value for the received signal strength indication, from the predicted range. Because the beacon signal has nonlinear properties, the BITON algorithm is used to translate user movements into linear motion. The LKF algorithm uses the predicted user location and beacon coordinates to calculate the exact indoor location coordinates of a user.

Despite the introduction of multiple standard device-to-device communication protocols (i.e., WiFi direct, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, NFC), transferring data across devices remains hard for mobile programmers for three reasons. 1) different devices support different D2D communication interfaces, and therefore the available D2D communication channels are dynamically decided by the peers; 2) different D2D interfaces have different features (connection establish time, data rate, energy consumption) and different performances under different contexts, complicating the decision which channel to use; 3) implementing and debugging data transmission functionalities requires knowing the low-level details of communication protocols, which is difficult and error prone. To solve the above mentioned problem, this paper presents a runtime framework for context-sensitive device-to-device communication. The presented framework consists of two major components: 1) a set of encapsulated D2D data transmission interfaces to reduce the programming efforts; 2) a context-sensitive communication channel selection algorithm to select the optimal communication channel as defined by the dynamic context. We design and implement the runtime framework, and evaluate its performance in terms of the required programming effort, energy consumption and data transmission latency under different contexts.

While discovery protocols like Multicast DNS, Apple AirDrop, and Bluetooth Low Energy have gained widespread adoption across both IoT and mobile devices, most of these protocols do not offer any form of privacy control for the service, and often leak sensitive information such as service type, device hostname, device owner's identity, and more in the clear. To address the need for better privacy in both the IoT and the mobile landscape, we develop two protocols for private service discovery and private mutual authentication. Our protocols provide private and authentic service advertisements, zero round-trip (0-RTT) mutual authentication, and are provably secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk key-exchange model. In contrast to alternatives, our protocols are lightweight and require minimal modification to existing key-exchange protocols. We integrate our protocols into an existing open-source distributed applications framework, and provide benchmarks on multiple hardware platforms: Intel Edisons, Raspberry Pis, smartphones, laptops, and desktops. Finally, we discuss some privacy limitations of the Apple AirDrop protocol (a peer-to-peer file sharing mechanism) and show how to improve the privacy of Apple AirDrop using our private mutual authentication protocol.

However, the stability of RSS is fragile due to internal multipath effects. This problem causes the reference points (RPs) to be mis-matched during system localization. Subsequently, the localization performance is degraded. To reduce the fluctuation of signal, we use a WiFi/ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)/ Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) fusion localization system, but the problem that RPs are mis-matched still exists. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a WiFi/BLE/PDR fusion localization system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to solve the problem. The method makes use of the signal features that can not be captured by the traditional positioning systems, and improves the localization accuracy. In the training phase, the scheme utilizes RSS to construct RP fingerprint sequences and set up a CNN structure. WiFi and BLE localization models are trained with the structure. In the test phase, the trained models are employed for localization. Then, the location information from WiFi, BLE, and PDR is combined to obtain the location coordinates. The result shows that the average error of the method is 2.47 m. Compared with traditional methods, the method proposed in this paper is more effective.

We propose the first piece of technology tailored explicitly to close the loop between anaesthesiologist and patient with continuous drug monitoring. Direct detection of drugs is achieved with electrochemical techniques, and several options are present in literature to measure propofol (widely used anaesthetics). Still, the sensors proposed do not enable in-situ detection, they do not provide this information continuously, and they are based on bulky and costly lab equipment. In this paper, we present a novel smart pen-shaped electronic system for continuous monitoring of propofol in human serum. The system consists of a needle-shaped sensor, a quasi digital front-end, a smart machine learning data processing, in a single wireless battery-operated embedded device featuring Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. The system has been tested and characterized in real, undiluted human serum, at 37 degrees C. The device features a limit of detection of 3.8 mu M, meeting the requirement of the target application, with an electronics system 59% smaller and 81% less power consuming w.r.t. the state-of-the-art, using a smart machine learning classification for data processing, which guarantees up to twenty continuous measure.

Hence, it restricts the uses of wireless protocol such as IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Moreover, there are promising technologies such as TSCH (Time Slotted Channel Hoping) MAC (Medium Access Control) which can be deployed in the different environment, which are prone to interference. In this research work we focus on overcoming the issue for designing the AS (Adaptive Scheduling) for TSCH - MANET (Mobile Adhoc Network); furthermore it is very difficult to design scheduling technique considering the unpredictable nature of data source location and wireless link, this results in waste of reserve resource. Moreover proposed Adaptive Scheduling model allows the both slots i.e. shared and dedicated slots, it also allows the communicating device to active the assigned slots adaptively. Hence, our proposed AS model achieves the higher overall access fairness, minimal idle listening overhead, higher packet deliver rate; further to cope up with the higher traffic load MANET device can activate the additional slots dynamically. Moreover, the outcome of Adaptive Scheduling model shows the higher data transmission and lower energy consumption.	[Sridhara, S.

Nowadays, traffic control at intersections is typically done by traffic light systems which are not optimal and exhibit several drawbacks, such as poor efficiency and real-time adaptability. With the advent of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicles are being equipped with state-of-the-art technology, enabling cooperative decision-making which will certainly overwhelm the available traffic control systems. This solution strongly penalizes users without such capabilities, namely pedestrians, cyclists, and other legacy vehicles. Therefore, in this work, a prototype based on an alternative technology to the standard vehicular communications, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), is presented. The proposed framework aims to integrate legacy and modern vehicular communication systems into a cohesive management system. In this framework, the movements of users at intersections are managed by a centralized controller which, through the use of networked retransmitters deployed at intersections, broadcasts alerts and virtual light signalization orders. Users receive the aforementioned information on their own smart devices, discarding the need for dedicated light signalization infrastructures. Field tests, carried out with a real-world implementation, validate the correct operation of the proposed framework.

The most common localization methods are based on measuring a location dependent parameter such as Received Signal Strength (RSS) or Angle of Arrival (AoA). Then the measured parameters are used to estimate the sensor location by using a multilateration algorithm. AoA estimation can provide good localization accuracy for narrowband array-based systems. The research has drawn considerable attention in the literature and numerous methods have been proposed to improve the localization accuracy. The two-step method suffers from information loss from the received signals when the estimation of the parameters is communicated to the multilateration step. In this paper, we propose a new localization algorithm which iterates between AoA estimation and multilateration steps to refine the position estimate. We develop a localization scenario for the assessment and validation of the algorithm in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor networks. Simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves a better localization accuracy when compared to the common two-step and achieving this after only a few iterations. Additionally, our method comes very close to the performance of the position estimation relying directly on the received signal, known as Direct Position Estimation (DPE), while reducing its complexity.

In the project 'MuseumEye', the augmentations generated were localized based on a hybrid system that combines of (SLAM) markerless tracking technology and the indoor Beacons or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). These augmentations include a combination of multimedia content and different levels of visual information that required for museum visitors. Using mobile devices to pilot this application, we developed a UX design model that has the ability to evaluate the user experience and usability of the application. This paper focuses on the multidisciplinary outcomes of the project from both a technical and museological perspective based on public responses. A field evaluation of the AR system was conducted after the UX model considered. Twenty-six participants were recruited in Leeds museum and another twenty participants in the Egyptian museum in Cairo. Results showed positive responses on experiencing the system after adopting the UX design model. This study contributes on synthesizing a UX design model for AR applications to reach the optimum levels of user interaction required that reflects ultimately on the entire museum experience.

The LBS are ubiquitous and an easy target for non-cryptographic attacks that traditional security methods cannot address. In this work, we detect the Received Signal Strength (RSS) based attacks that affect the localization of smart devices in the IoT networks and report the attack tolerance of popular IoT protocols. A two-tier ratio metric method and Residue Under Curve (RUC) metric method is utilized to detect the malicious node in the IoT protocols. We propose to use a novel Geometric, and Arithmetic Mean (GM-AM) ratio as a feature to detect the RSS attacks where GM follows strictly Schur-Concavity property and AM follows non-strict concavity property. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on real-world IoT testbeds with Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocols using the RSS values of these opportunistic signals.

STERLING: A framework for serious games to encourage recycling	REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments III	SEP 10-12, 2018	Berlin, GERMANY	SPIE		Waste disposal; recycling; low-cost sensors; low-energy sensors; gamification; IoT		Waste disposal and recycling is becoming one of the main problems in Western countries. Improving both recycling culture among citizenship and waste collection and treatment logistics is critical to augment the percentage of waste being recycled. In this paper we present STERLING, an initiative that aims to help in both fields. STERLING is a framework composed by a low-cost, low-energy sensor installed in recycling containers to measure fill level and other physical parameters. The sensor is activated magnetically each time the container lid is opened by a user. Instead of directly sending this information to a cloud-based server, our sensor broadcasts a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet to the surrounding area. An App running in the mobile phone of the user performs two actions: To capture this information, re-sending it to the cloud-based server, and to assign credit to this particular user for having used the recycling container. In this way, users are rewarded for using the container, and the infrastructure bene fits from cost-free communications from the container to the server. In this paper we will describe our idea in detail, showing how it can be used to develop a rewarding schema that encourages recycling.

Co-ordinate location can be estimated using radio fingerprinting techniques applied to Received Signal Strength (RSS) values from BLE beacons. Earlier work on BLE fingerprinting has noted that the separate BLE advertising channels can exhibit different RSS values, although modern consumer devices do not provide channel information and therefore report a composite RSS with artificially inflated variance that can lead to reduced positioning accuracy. In this work we quantify how often this channel dispersion occurs in typical environments, what the extent of the dispersion is, and what impact it has on positioning. Furthermore we explore how to obtain channel information when using today's consumer devices. We find that the dispersion is both common and significant and leads to significantly reduced positioning accuracy; in our experiments only 10% of composite variances were within 1 dBm of an individual channel's variance, and 40% of composite variances were at least 4 dBm greater. We also show that the behaviour of the channels is sufficiently distinct that a fingerprinting scheme that uses a signal map for each achieves significantly increased positioning accuracy (up to 3 m).

This paper examines wireless standard classification for spatially separated emitters that are interfering in time and frequency. The proposed approach involves estimating the number of interfering signals and their directions of arrival, spatial isolation, and then wireless standard classification using a deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN is trained to classify commercial wireless standards, including 4G LTE, 5G, IEEE 802.11ax, Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0, and Narrowband Internetof-Things, using a synthetic dataset impaired with typical channel and receiver impairments, including AWGN and Rayleigh/Rician fading. When a single emitter is transmitting, spatial filtering using a four element uniform linear array (ULA) increases the classification accuracy of low SNR signals by up to 26% compared to a single antenna system. When multiple emitters are transmitting, especially when there are three or more, a four-element ULA cannot spatially filter well enough to yield high classification accuracies. In these cases, we show that switching to a sparse array can improve classification accuracy without adding more array elements. Sparse arrays can improve classification accuracy by up to 33% compared to ULAs in scenarios with multiple emitters or closely spaced emitters.	[Shebert, Samuel R.; Buehrer, R.

However, realizing an appropriate power supply for the practical application of these sensors as wearable devices, it is necessary to improve the output of lactate biofuel cells. In this study, we fabricated a lactate biofuel cell that employed paper substrate using screen printing. The proposed paper-based biofuel cell (PBFC) features a novel electrode design that affords an open circuit voltage of approximately 3.4 V when using an array with six cells in series. Furthermore, a 6 x 6 array of the lactate biofuel cell, i.e., an array comprising six cells in series and six cells in parallel, yielded a power output of 4.3 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this output of the proposed design is higher than those of previously reported lactate biofuel cells. Arrays of the proposed cell were capable of driving a Bluetooth low-energy device for wireless transmission, without requiring a booster circuit. A commercially available activity meter could be driven for 1.5 h using artificial sweat to fuel a 6 x 6 array of the PBFCs.

J	Paek, J; Ko, J; Shin, H				Paek, Jeongyeup; Ko, JeongGil; Shin, Hyungsik			A Measurement Study of BLE iBeacon and Geometric Adjustment Scheme for Indoor Location-Based Mobile Applications	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the iBeacons have recently gained large interest for enabling various proximity-based application services. Given the ubiquitously deployed nature of Bluetooth devices including mobile smartphones, using BLE and iBeacon technologies seemed to be a promising future to come. This work started off with the belief that this was true: iBeacons could provide us with the accuracy in proximity and distance estimation to enable and simplify the development of many previously difficult applications. However, our empirical studies with three different iBeacon devices from various vendors and two types of smartphone platforms prove that this is not the case. Signal strength readings vary significantly over different iBeacon vendors, mobile platforms, environmental or deployment factors, and usage scenarios. This variability in signal strength naturally complicates the process of extracting an accurate location/proximity estimation in real environments. Our lessons on the limitations of iBeacon technique lead us to design a simple class attendance checking application by performing a simple form of geometric adjustments to compensate for the natural variations in beacon signal strength readings. We believe that the negative observations made in this work can provide future researchers with a reference on how well of a performance to expect from iBeacon devices as they enter their system design phases.

To provide an affordable alternative to developing countries and resource-constrained areas, this study designs an electrochemical detection system based on smartphones, which uses Bluetooth Low Energy to convert open-source potentiostat data based on PSoC-5LP. The WeChat application on the smartphone provides an interface for entering experimental parameters and visualizing the results in real time. The smartphone-based electrochemical detection system has a simple design and reduces the size (10 x3 x0.3 cm(3)) and the cost of the hardware ($ 18). The system performs the most commonly used cyclic voltammetry for electrochemical detection, with results that are comparable to those obtained using a commercial potentiostat and an error rate of 1.3 %. In the classical teaching experiment of electrochemical determination of ascorbic acid in orange juice samples, the measured value of the system is 0.367 +/- 0.012 mg/mL, compared with the standard reference value of 0.37 mg/mL, which is obviously a convincing value. Therefore, this system is a low-cost, reliable alternative to a potentiostat for research, education or product integration development.

According to the fast and widespread COVID-19 contagion globally, the demand for ventilators and PPE materials is very h h to provide safety equipment to healthcare professionals and doctors. The existing Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) it's not designed to COVID-19 and social distance. With the limitations of the current navigation systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS ) in indoor settings (Hospital, Quarantine, etc.), alternative PAPR tracking methods need to developing for such environments. This project aims to design a system that uses Bluetooth for PAPR tracking. Bluetooth Low Energy modules (BLE) serve as beacons, and the hospital will have information about their position. They will continuously advertise this information about the passing doctors. When the PAPR, which is attached to a Bluetooth module, passes by a beacon on the hospital corridors, it will receive the position data and send it directly to the ESP32 circuit. In turn, the ESP32 device will send the data to be the control room. So will add IoT technology in the respirator to guarantee physical distance, healthcare sta tracking, and recording.

The service uses push notifications to deliver this content. Notifications can be delivered to all visitors or personalized - to a group of visitors or to a specific visitor. The service segments museum visitors according to their location and their profile, which is built dynamically over time. For the geospatial segmentation of visitors, geofencing is used - each visitor is assigned to a segment that corresponds to a specific geographic area - part of an open space or exhibit. The service allows localization of visitors by their GPS coordinates or by estimating their distance from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The geofences are described as a polygons or circles. Geospatial segmentation is implemented using a NoSQL database MongoDB, which has built-in capabilities for working with geospatial queries. Depending on the profile, each visitor falls into one or several segments: professional researcher, non-professional researcher, inspiration seeker, casual visitor, and visitors with disabilities. For each visitor, personalized content is delivered, depending on the segments to which the visitor is assigned. The necessary experiments have been conducted and analyzed to prove the applicability of the service for real-time delivery of personalized content.

For this reason, self-reporting, observing and instrumental risk assessment methods were proposed, in the literature. Amongst these assessment methods, the instrumental risk assessment method has the highest level of efficiency and accuracy. However, the instrument method, such as smart-garment, provide data regarding the postures of an operator while does not provide information for the operator's surrounding. In case of processing the instrument method's data by an ergonomist, additional information regarding the operator environment will be mandated. This research work aims to propose a hybrid risk assessment kit (HRAK) that combines the observing and instrument risk assessment methods in real-time. The HRAK employs Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to connect the operators remotely with an ergonomist. Moreover, we design a smart-garment for the instrument-based risk assessment method. Furthermore, we develop a graphical risk assessment platform (GRAP) to configure and monitor the postures of operators and to assist the ergonomist to quantify the hazard postures. Graphical results are obtained and analyzed for the operator's postures by using GRAP. Finally, the posture's results are classified based on adaptable thresholds into hazard or alerting, attention and normal postures.

Taking advantage of low power electronics, this prototype device is fully powered from harvested energy. The prototype device also builds a bidirectional data communication link with an external data transceiver (TRx) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wirelessly transferring digitized ECG data to and receiving user commands from the external data TRx. To minimize the power consumption of the device, efforts have been made on designing an ultra-low-power analog front-end (AFE) for amplifying and filtering of ECG signals and optimizing the microcontroller unit (MCU) firmware for sending the ECG data packets to the external data TRx at a throughput of 816 bits per second (bps). These received ECG data packets are communicated over USB to a PC, where a custom graphical user interface (GUI) decodes and displays the data packets in real-time. The user also sends start/stop commands, which trigger the wearable device to automatically stream the ECG data back to the GUI. We have characterized the functionalities of the energy harvesting, the AFE amplifying and filtering, and the wireless data transmission of the wearable device, and evaluated the entire system performance of conducting wireless ECG sensing.

Recent approaches have leveraged contextual fingerprinting to formulate access control frameworks for both generating and enforcing access control policies. However, effectively and automatically identifying the context attributes relevant for access has proven challenging and cumbersome. An approach that shows promise in supporting more expressive and easy-to-use attribute-based access control relies on recent advances in continuous neighbor discovery protocols and low cost wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). These technologies have created opportunities to build smart environments that can seamlessly and inexpensively provide rich contextual data. These capabilities have the potential to enable new transparent and automatic approaches to defining and evaluating access control policies for mobile users and for detecting anomalous access patterns in smart environments. In this paper, we present the LAD framework that uses raw contextual data available via technologies such as BLE to derive real-time attributes defined by the presence of mobile and static nodes in the nearby environment. Based on user interactions in these environments, our framework learns appropriate access control policies and enforces these policies based on attributes that change in real-time as users move in the smart environment.

J	Raza, S; Misra, P; He, ZT; Voigt, T				Raza, Shahid; Misra, Prasant; He, Zhitao; Voigt, Thiemo			Building the Internet of Things with bluetooth smart	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet of things; IoT; Bluetooth LE; BLE; Open hardware; Open source; Contiki O.S		The Internet of Things, or the IoT, is an emerging, disruptive technology that enables physical devices to communicate across disparate networks. IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Low power design and self-sustainability are the key for the usability of our helmet, to avoid frequent battery recharges and dangerous power losses. Hidden in the helmet structure, the designed system is equipped with a dense sensor network including accelerometer, temperature, light, and alcohol gas level, in addition, a Bluetooth low energy module interfaces the device with an onvehicle IR camera, and eventually the user's smart phone. To keep the driver focused, the user interface consists of a small non-invasive display combined with a speech recognition system. System architecture is optimized for aggressive power management, featuring an ultra-low power wake-up radio, and fine-grained software-controlled shutdown of all sensing, communication and computing subsystems. Finally, a multi-source energy harvesting module (solar and kinetic) performs high-efficiency power recovery, improving battery management and achieving self-sustainability. SHelmet supports rich context awareness applications; breath alcohol control; real time vehicle data; sleep and fall detection; data display.

Aiming at unleashing the potential of these proximity-based services, it is essential to devise robust techniques enabling smart devices to know their proximity close neighbors and be able to communicate with each other. To this end, we propose, design, and evaluate a robust framework capable to successfully co-localizewalking groups of mobile users, in real-time and in a centralized manner. It leverages Bluetooth low energy technology to achieve a high degree of co-location accuracy. From the collected radio signals, we construct a graph network in which the distance between pairwise vertices represents the connection strength between mobile users. Then, we propose a modified version of edge betweenness techniques, with an average path length, as a key enabler for a high clustering accuracy. We analyze the performance in terms of clustering accuracy of the proposed scheme. First, we assess its performance numerically. Then, we conduct analysis on the experimental data set to demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of our method. Through obtained results, we have shown that our method can be successfully applied to co-localize people walking as part of the same group.

This allows them to perform different applications inside a room through a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based on biological signals. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are used as control signals. The applications in the room are: light control,bed inclination and requesting assistance with a buzzer. These signals are captured using the Ultracortex Mark IV acquisition system of the company OpenBCI connected to self-developed software. The gestures defined to perform the analysis are: left eye blink, right eye blink, eyebrow raise and no action. The data is filtered in the alpha band (8-13)Hz and is used to train an artificial intelligence model based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks. For each gesture a control signal is generated and sent via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to an embedded system in charge of the room prototype functions. At the first phase, the volunteers did not have any motor disabilities. The average accuracy value for eye blinking was 80% and for eyebrow raising 85% in the training model. Real-time classification showed an accuracy of 78.75% using five-second length windows. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.	[Sanchez Bolanos, Cristian D.; Rodriguez, Nicolas D.; Perdomo, Cesar A.

Its recent signal stability and propagation distance improvement inspired us to conduct this project. Beacons and scanners used two Bluetooth specifications, BLE 5.0 and 4.2, for experimentations. The measurement paradigm consisted of three segments, RSSI-distance conversion, multi-beacon in-plane, and diverse directional measurement. The analysis methods applied to process the data for precise positioning included the Signal propagation model, Trilateration, Modification coefficient, and Kalman filter. As the experiment results showed, the positioning accuracy could reach 10 cm when the beacons and scanners were at the same horizontal plane in a less-noisy environment. Nevertheless, the positioning accuracy dropped to a meter-scale accuracy when the measurements were executed in a three-dimensional configuration and complex environment. According to the analysis results, the BLE wireless signal strength is susceptible to interference in the manufacturing environment but still workable on certain occasions. In addition, the Bluetooth 5.0 specifications seem more promising in bringing brightness to RTLS applications in the future, due to its higher signal stability and better performance in lower interference environments.

To satisfy the energy demand for the next generation of SHB which can interconnect WSNs to make the internet of smart home-building (IoSHB), this study introduces the design and implementation of a 250 mW to 2.3 W energy harvesting device. The proposed device is dynamically autonomous owing to the integration of embedded solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and power storage through a supercapacitor (SC; 5 V, 0.47 F) capable of powering WSNs for 95 s (up to 4.11 V). The deployed device can harvest indoor and outdoor ambient light at a minimum illumination of 50 lux and a maximum illumination of 200 lux. Moreover, the proposed system supports wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to do data transfer to a webserver as a complete internet of things (IoT) device.

Multimodal Approaches for Indoor Localization for Ambient Assisted Living in Smart Homes	INFORMATION			English	Article						big data; machine learning; indoor localization; ambient assisted living; internet of things; smart homes; elderly population; indoor location; human-computer interaction; assistive technology	LOCATION; TRACKING; RECOGNITION	This work makes multiple scientific contributions to the field of Indoor Localization for Ambient Assisted Living in Smart Homes. First, it presents a Big-Data driven methodology that studies the multimodal components of user interactions and analyzes the data from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and BLE scanners to detect a user's indoor location in a specific 'activity-based zone' during Activities of Daily Living. Second, it introduces a context independent approach that can interpret the accelerometer and gyroscope data from diverse behavioral patterns to detect the 'zone-based' indoor location of a user in any Internet of Things (IoT)-based environment. These two approaches achieved performance accuracies of 81.36% and 81.13%, respectively, when tested on a dataset. Third, it presents a methodology to detect the spatial coordinates of a user's indoor position that outperforms all similar works in this field, as per the associated root mean squared error-one of the performance evaluation metrics in ISO/IEC18305:2016-an international standard for testing Localization and Tracking Systems. Finally, it presents a comprehensive comparative study that includes Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, k-NN, Gradient Boosted Trees, Deep Learning, and Linear Regression, to address the challenge of identifying the optimal machine learning approach for Indoor Localization.

The design and development in the context of IoT is severely influenced by requirements for small form factor, easy to use, measurement devices, which are deployed in combination with scalable, web-based or portable, applications. The particular case of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, miniaturization, and power and cost efficiency were the major aspects taken into account in the research presented here. The considered systems focus on living spaces, classrooms, university amphitheaters and laboratories, and office buildings, and target the achievement of a lifetime of the measurement devices as long as possible. Our experimental results indicate an operating period between a couple of months and 3 years for wireless sensing devices powered by a single off-the-shelf battery, depending on the measurement and transmission rates. All the developed systems are suitable for the implementation of scenarios in the context of IoT and offer future development possibilities in terms of measurement and energetic capabilities, which are supported by the rapid progress in the integrated circuit (IC) industry and by firmware optimization.

The estimation is achieved using RSSIs (Received Signal Strength Indicators) from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons detected by smartphones carried by pedestrians moving in one of eight directions. We investigated a method to estimate the position and moving direction of pedestrians using multiple time instances of RSSIs from multiple BLE beacons detected. The method was based on DNN (Deep Neural Network), which were trained to estimate the position and moving direction from a set of measured RSSIs. We fixed the size of the room to be estimated and compared the estimation accuracy by varying the number of beacons and their placement patterns. We also attempted to reduce the estimation error by treating the direction of movement as a continuous value. As a result, the estimation accuracy improved as the number of beacons increased, and a difference of 60.9% in the position estimation error and 61.2% in the moving direction estimation error was seen when 4 and 8 beacons were used. Regarding the difference in the installation interval of beacons, we found that it is important to install them sparsely and evenly in the room.

Wearable, flexible sensors provide increased comfort and improved human factors. Recent advances in additive manufacturing, such as printed electronics, allow miniaturization of sensors and implementation onto flexible, unobtrusive substrates. We developed a low power, flexible, sensor platform with wireless Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface. The platform integrates 9 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) inertial sensor, ambient sensor (temperature, humidity, and Carbon Dioxide/Volatile Organic Compounds - CO2/VOC sensor), and prototyping area for printed sensors. In this paper we present an implementation of a printed co-doped barium titanate capacitive sensor that is highly sensitive to water vapor as an unobtrusive breathing sensor. The 2x4mm sensor is highly sensitive to changes during breathing, even at distances of more than 20cm. Synergy of information from on-platform and printed sensors allows long term user monitoring both as wearable and ambient sensor. We demonstrate the results of sensor validation using 9 subjects. Average change of capacitance of the sensor during breathing at the distance of 7.5 cm was 6.2 +/- 3.5 pF. Our sensors represent very good option for low-power, wearable, and unobtrusive monitoring.

J	Imtiaz, SA; Iranmanesh, S; Rodriguez-Villegas, E				Imtiaz, Syed Anas; Iranmanesh, Saam; Rodriguez-Villegas, Esther			A Low Power System With EEG Data Reduction for Long-Term Epileptic Seizures Monitoring	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Epilepsy; seizure detection; wearables; low-power biomedical system; electroencephalography	ACQUISITION SOC; PERFORMANCE; PROCESSOR; CLASSIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; MANAGEMENT	Long-term monitoring of epilepsy patients requires low-power systems that can record and transmit electroencephalogram data over extended periods of time. Since seizure events are rare, long-term monitoring inherently results in large amounts of data that are recorded and hence need to be reduced. This paper presents an ultra-low power integrated circuit implementation of a data reduction algorithm for epilepsy monitoring, specific to seizure events. The algorithm uses line length of the electroencephalogram signals as the key discriminating feature to classify epochs of data as seizure or non-seizure events. It is implemented in AMS 0.18-mu m CMOS technology and its output is connected to a Bluetooth low energy transceiver to wirelessly transmit potential seizure events. All the modules of the algorithm have been implemented on chip to use a small number of clock cycles and remain mostly in an idle mode. The algorithm, on the chip, achieves 50% of data reduction with a sensitivity of 80% for capturing seizure events. The overall power consumption of the chip is measured to be 23 mu W, while the full system with wireless transmission consumes 743 mu W. The results in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of a long-term seizure monitoring system capable of running autonomously for over two weeks.

On top of that, diverse applications and end-to-end services with very different performance requirements should ideally share the same network infrastructure. Software defined networks (SDN) were defined to allow this coexistence, but they have seen very limited adoption in IoT systems due to the inherent resource constrained nature of the wireless devices. Additionally, the low-power nature of IoT communication standards does not usually allow for physically separated control and data channels, which is a basic requirement for real-time network slicing. In this work, we propose a SDN implementation for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which has become the de-facto technology for IoT applications. The proposed BLE mesh structure is able to use different protocols for different services, ensuring a clear separation between control and data channels while still being sent over the wireless medium. A proof-of-concept for the proposed SDN implementation is given in a real BLE mesh testbed, where measurements show how the system is able to automatically detect and recover from network congestion by identifying the nodes responsible of such situation and reconfiguring their parameters over the air.

The authenticity of devices must be protected to prevent cloned or corrupted devices from joining a private network. State-of-the-art systems already provide secured communication links either by a security layer in the interface protocol stack (e.g. the Security Manager Protocol in Bluetooth Low Energy) or by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol on top of the interface protocol. These solutions have in common that they only protect the communication links. Thus the system is still vulnerable to active and passive physical attacks that aim to clone the device or to extract the used keys. We show an approach with off-the-shelf security trust anchors that allows securing a device against such attacks. The proposed solution allows product authentication with low-cost ready-to use components which can be easily integrated in an architecture similar to existing proposals. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by presenting a prototype implementation and discuss performance and security implications. The results indicate that the proposed architecture provides reasonable security at acceptable costs and can serve as template for many applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) context.

Several efforts have been made to cope with the challenges of accurate positioning systems in the presence of signal interference. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach through Gradient Boosting Enhanced with Step-Wise Feature Augmentation using Artificial Neural Network (AugBoost-ANN) for indoor localization applications as it trains over labeled data. For this purpose, we propose an IoT architecture using a star network topology to collect the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules by means of a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point (AP) in an indoor environment. The dataset for the experiments is gathered in the real world in different periods to match the real environments. Next, we address the challenges of the AugBoost-ANN training which augments features in each iteration of making a decision tree using a deep neural network and the transfer learning technique. Experimental results show more than 8% improvement in terms of accuracy in comparison with the existing gradient boosting and deep learning methods recently proposed in the literature, and our proposed model acquires a mean location accuracy of 0.77 m.

This energy-efficient ASIC was specifically designed to interface with multiple Ion-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistors (ISFETs) and detect biomarkers like pH, Na+, K+ and Ca2+ in human sweat. The ISFET-ASIC system can allow real-time noninvasive and continuous health monitoring. The ANTIGONE ASIC architecture is based on the current-to-frequency converter through the charge balancing principle. The same front-end can digitize multiple currents produced by four sweat ISFET sensors in time multiplexing. The front-end demonstrates good linearity over a dynamic range that spans from 1 pA up to 500 nA. The consumed energy per conversion is less than 1 J. The chip is programmable and works in eight different modes of operation. The system uses a standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to configure, control and read the digitally converted sensor data. The chip is controlled by a portable device over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) through a Microcontroller Unit (MCU). The sweat sensing system is part of a bigger wearable platform that exploits the convergence of multiparameter biosensors and environmental sensors for personalized and preventive healthcare.

As the existing technologies fall short in achieving these goals due to cost of deployment and/or higher latencies, we propose to exploit the existing infrastructure of power lines when the aircraft is on the tarmac. We propose an architecture that extends power line communications with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices that are embedded on the cargo. We show that BLE mesh can extend the range by interfacing with PLC modems to achieve an IoT solution for continuous monitoring and tracking. In order to evaluate this, we also propose a novel software-defined radio based testbed that can be used to evaluate various scenarios. The novelty of our testbed includes BLE mesh network that supports high reliability and low latency communication and support for emulation of electrical loads to inject impulse noise into the powerline network. We then measure end-to-end latencies and packet delivery ratios in realistic settings for the smart cargo monitoring solution. Our results indicate that our hybrid network offers a worst case latency of 24.85 ms for a 570 m distance between warehouse and cargo monitoring station.	[Vijay, Rathinamala; Prabhakar, T.

The platform aims to allow all the researchers to start IoT research, such as activity recognition and context estimation, easily and efficiently. The most important contribution is the hardware that we have designed. Various sensors often used for research are embedded in an ultra tiny board with the size of 50 mm (W) x 10 mm (H) x 5 mm (D) and weight around 3 g including a battery. Concretely, the following sensors are embedded on this board: acceleration, gyro, magnetic, light, UV, temperature, humidity, and pressure. In addition, this board has BLE (Bluetooth low energy) connectivity and capability of a rechargeable battery. By using 110 mAh battery, it can run more than 15 hours. The most different point from other similar boards is that our board has a large flash memory for logging all the data without a smartphone. By using SenStick, all the users can collect various data easily and focus on IoT data analytics. In this paper, we introduce SenStick platform and some case studies. Through the user study, we confirmed the usefulness of our proposed platform.

No degradation of the piezoelectric signals is observed for the sensors laminated at 110 degrees C, despite approaching the Curie temperature of the piezoelectric material. The piezoelectric sensors, here monitoring force impact in smart glass applications, are characterized by using a calibrated impact hammer system and standardized impact situations. Stand-alone piezoelectric sensors and piezoelectric sensors integrated on poly(methyl methacrylate) are also evaluated. The piezoelectric constants obtained from the measurements of the nonintegrated piezoelectric sensors are in good agreement with the literature. The piezoelectric sensor response is measured by using either physical electrical contacts between the piezoelectric sensors and the readout electronics, or wirelessly via both noncontact capacitive coupling and Bluetooth low-energy radio link. The developed sensor concept is finally demonstrated in smart window prototypes, in which integrated piezoelectric sensors are used to detect break-in attempts. Additionally, each prototype includes an electrochromic film to control the light transmittance of the window, a screen printed electrochromic display for status indications and wireless communication with an external server, and a holistic approach of hybrid printed electronic systems targeting smart multifunctional glass applications.

Hence, this paper describes a novel smartphone-based sensor fusion algorithm. It combines the relative inertial measurement unit (IMU) based movements of the pedestrian dead reckoning with the absolute fingerprinting-based position estimations of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Bluetooth (Bluetooth Low Energy-BLE), and magnetic field anomalies as well as a building model in real time. Thus, a step-based position estimation without knowledge of any start position was achieved. For this, a grid-based particle filter and a Bayesian filter approach were combined. Furthermore, various optimization methods were compared to weigh the different information sources within the sensor fusion algorithm, thus achieving high position accuracy. Although a particle filter was used, no particles move due to a novel grid-based particle interpretation. Here, the particles' probability values change with every new information source and every stepwise iteration via a probability-map-based approach. By adjusting the weights of the individual measurement methods compared to a knowledge-based reference, the mean and the maximum position error were reduced by 31%, the RMSE by 34%, and the 95-percentile positioning errors by 52%.

BLE-based localization is, typically, performed based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which suffers from different drawbacks due to its significant fluctuations. In this paper, we focus on a multiple-model estimation framework for analyzing and addressing effects of orientation of a BLE-enabled device on indoor localization accuracy. The fusion unit of the proposed method would merge orientation estimated by RSSI values and heading estimated by Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to gain higher accuracy in orientation classification. In contrary to existing RSSI-based solutions that use a single path-loss model, the proposed framework consists of eight orientation-matched path loss models coupled with a multi-sensor and data-driven classification model that estimates the orientation of a hand-held device with high accuracy of 99%. By estimating the orientation, we could mitigate the effect of orientation on the RSSI values and consequently improve RSSI-based distance estimates. In particular, the proposed data-driven and multiple-model framework is constructed based on over 10 million RSSI values and IMU sensor data collected via an implemented LBS platform.

In this paper, a comparative study between two soft computing techniques was done, namely, between: (a) a Multiple Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (MANFIS) and (b) two different Artificial Neural Network structures - and this comparison was one investigated in relation with a practical embedded application. More precisely, the research used a new wearable system, named Intell.TieSens, in order to model the complex nonlinear relationship that exist between the capacitive sensors embedded in a tie collar and the 3D head position of the wearer of that tie. The Intell.TieSens system was designed to be a noncontact system, low power, portable, lightweight, having a Bluetooth Low Energy wireless data communication capability in order to be able both to be paired with a personal computer or with a smartphone and to identify in real time the human 3D head position. The results showed the superior performances obtained with MANFIS system - two times better than the performances obtained with the RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural network. Out of the tested models, the MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron) neural network obtained the lowest performances.

However, the recent emergence of the RAIN Alliance and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is resulting in the proliferation of fixed and mobile infrastructure for the radio identification of both things and people through standardised passive and active RFID technologies, respectively. Consequently, today, there are everyday situations where independently operated RFID systems are likely to co exist, both ephemerally and indefinitely. In this paper, we present a mechanism for mutual discovery and the subsequent exchange of structured data among such colocated, and often heterogeneous, systems. The resulting machine readable real time representation of the real world on a human scale is what we call hyperlocal context, an open, standards based language for the Internet of Things. We argue that hyperlocal context and the presented mechanisms foster efficient crowd sensing which combines the complementary characteristics of both active and UHF passive RFID systems. The underlying framework has been successfully implemented in open source software with BLE supported and UHF passive RFID integration in progress. Collaboration among the scientific and industrial communities to advance standards for collective context will only become more critical as the proliferation of RFID infrastructure accelerates.

We feel that there is a need to build software that would allow users to configure the use of beacon data subject to the requirements of an application context, and to reuse the same set of beacons for some other purpose by just modifying the configuration. In this paper we describe uBeacon, a cloud based service with a web interface that allows users to define configurations that include constraints between beacon signal readers and beacons linked to objects or people. These constraints take the form of rules, such as "Object A should always be within 1m of object/reader B." uBeacon stores these configurations in a database, continuously monitors beacon data from readers, and notifies users via mobile push notifications whenever a rule of a configuration has been violated. We report the results of a pilot study with a set of participants and discuss the several possible applications of uBeacon to highlight its usefulness.

These signals are further processed by a microcontroller, embodied in the transceiver, for different application purposes. By implementing the demodulation in a software manner, the objective is to deploy different and more accurate strategies in the transceiver. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art solutions that consider a machine learning approach to the software defined demodulation did not provide measures of complexity nor if they are suitable for running on a low-cost low-power microcontroller. This work studied how feasible such a solution would be. Two case studies were considered: gaussian frequency-shift keying Bluetooth Low Energy and frequency-shift keying Wi-SUN demodulations. A comparison between artificial neural networks and classical algorithms was conducted. The deep learning performances proved to be comparable with those of the excellent Viterbi demodulator and they were finally validated with complexity measurements and analysis of processing time on microcontrollers to demonstrate the fulfilment with the memory requirements and the real time constraint for a demodulation with low data rate.

J	Mizmizi, M; Reggiani, L				Mizmizi, Marouan; Reggiani, Luca			Analysis of space labeling through binary fingerprinting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Wireless sensor networks; positioning; fingerprinting	INDOOR; LOCALIZATION	In the context of fingerprinting applications, this article presents the performance analysis of a type of space labeling based on the binary quantization of the received signal strength indicator. One of the common drawbacks of fingerprinting is the large data size and consequently the large search space and computational load as a result of either vastness of the positioning area or the finer resolution in the fingerprinting grid map. Our approach can be considered, for example, when we use very small, inexpensive beacons, like those based on bluetooth low energy technology, radio frequency identification, or in the future context of the Internet of Things. One of the interesting properties of this deployment is that it can be interpreted as a form of space labeling or encoding since space is divided into cells, and each cell is associated to a binary codeword with the corresponding scalability of the spatial resolution. Here, it developed the performance estimation, exploiting the association of this deployment to an error correcting code. The analysis and numerical and experimental results allow a deeper understanding of the impact of the proposed solution and show that it is robust and computationally efficient with respect to the traditional fingerprinting technique.

We propose a novel method to estimate the location of a moving device by aggregating information from multiple positioning systems into a single, more precise location estimation. The aggregated location is calculated as the place in which the product of the probability density functions (PDF) of individual methods has the maximum value. The experimental probability density functions of the three analyzed technologies are fitted by gamma distributions based on error histograms found in the literature and measurement data. The location measurements of the individual technologies are provided at different time instants, so the weighted product of the PDFs is used to improve aggregation accuracy. The discrete event-simulation model was used to evaluate the aggregation method with the Gauss-Markov mobility model. Simulations demonstrated that the calculated aggregated location was more accurate than any of the methods taken as the input, and average error was decreased by almost 13% compared to an arithmetic mean of the three considered localization methods, and by more than 36% compared to the single method with the highest accuracy.

Although many candidate technologies have been proposed, no one can still adapt to every use case. A case centered design and the implementation of the solution within the specific domain is the current research trend. With the rise of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons, i.e., platforms used to interact digitally with the real world, more standard positioning solutions are emerging in different contexts. However the reachable positioning accuracy with this technology is still unacceptable for some real applications (e.g., in the healthcare sector or the emergency management). In this paper, an hybrid localization application coupling a real time model based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) technique and the analysis of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of BLE beacons is proposed. In particular, the smartphone application is composed by three main real time threads: a model based step length estimation, heading determination and the fusion of beacon information to reset the position and the drift error of the PDR. In order to give soundness to our approach we firstly validated the step length smartphone app with a stereo-photogrammetric system. The whole proposed solution was then tested on fifteen healthy subjects.

We envision a scenario, in which batteryless sensors placed on small body parts (e.g., on-finger, in-ear, and in-mouth) can obtain operating power from another body-worn energy sources (e.g., already existing batterypowered wearable devices such as a smartphone, smartwatch, or BandAid-like battery patch attached to the neck). To demonstrate and validate the concept of IBPT, we implemented a prototype consisting of 1) a wrist-worn, battery-powered power transmitter that sends alternating current through the human body and 2) a finger-worn, batteryless sensor device that operates solely on body-transferred power. Evaluations on five subjects show that we can reliably support the power of approximately 1 mW, which can be used to operate an embedded system, continuously collect sensor (accelerometer) data, and wirelessly transfer the collected data in real-time using Bluetooth Low Energy. We believe that the proposed system has great potential to transform current architectures and designs for body-area networks, promoting the development of innovative on-body sensors that would otherwise not be possible with on-device batteries.

Among the many proposals, wireless indoor localization mechanisms based on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) are being widely explored. Most studies have focused on the evaluation of the capabilities of different mobile device brands and wireless network technologies. Furthermore, different parameters and algorithms have been proposed as a means of improving the accuracy of wireless-based localization mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the tuning of the RSSI fingerprint to be used in the implementation of a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 (BLE4.0) Bluetooth localization mechanism. Following a holistic approach, we start by assessing the capabilities of two Bluetooth sensor/receiver devices. We then evaluate the relevance of the RSSI fingerprint reported by each BLE4.0 beacon operating at various transmission power levels using feature selection techniques. Based on our findings, we use two classification algorithms in order to improve the setting of the transmission power levels of each of the BLE4.0 beacons. Our main findings show that our proposal can greatly improve the localization accuracy by setting a custom transmission power level for each BLE4.0 beacon.

Conventional gait analysis is usually used to assist in the treatment of patients in hospitals and is therefore conducted in a specific gait lab or with instruments operated by a medical professional. With conventional approaches, the time and cost involved in experimenting has increased and the accuracy of gait analysis has decreased. Furthermore, the demand to use gait analysis for personal purposes has recently increased. In this paper, a lightweight smart insole is proposed to assist in the analysis of human gait. The proposed lightweight smart insole uses a force sensitive resistor (FSR) array to measure a human step with low power consumption. The step measured by the FSR is used for gait analysis. The data are then converted into meaningful data such as the number of steps, walking velocity, and the distance travelled. The smart insole communicates with the user's smart device through Bluetooth low energy (LE). The smart device records the data in the memory, visualizes the pressure pattern on the display, and then analyzes the user's gait pattern. The method in which the lightweight smart insole system assesses and treats the individual's gait with the Smartphone application is also discussed.

However, some systems tend to work well only in certain visually feature-rich environments. It is often the case that feature-based matching techniques can have a hard time dealing with scenes with only a few features or a large number of repetitive features. In these situations, computer vision-based localization may fail to estimate camera position or may yield a large localization error. We approach this problem from a systems perspective, where we are required to obtain accurate localization of blind travellers using a smartphones app for localization. In particular, we assume that the environment is already instrumented with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signals to provide rough proximity information, and we propose to integrate it with visual information to perform efficient structure-from-motion and camera localization. Our multi-model sensing approach can accelerate localization speed and obtain more accuracy in challenging environments when compared to traditional baseline approaches. We also show that our approach can accelerate the time for reconstructing large 3D models. Our framework is released as an open source project. It can be used by different mobile operating systems, enabling the development of navigation applications on mobile platforms.

Until now, health and safety information for specific machinery was commonly held only as paper copies for student reference. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies mean that it is possible to provide highly-localised health and safety information as well as short instructional videos detailing the safe operation of workshop equipment using mobile technology. Each workshop has been equipped with a "learning beacon" - a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon that points mobile devices towards web pages. Students can download the Physical Web app on their mobile device and then use it to access the web page pointed to by the local beacon. The content can be easily updated using Google Sites and the university's own Sharepoint system, making it easy for teaching staff to maintain the content and to add and remove teaching materials as appropriate. Monitoring of the usage of the web pages showed that approximately 25% of the student cohort made use of this resource. This pilot project is a collaboration between the University of Wales Trinity St. David's School of Applied Computing and the School of Applied Art and Design.

Providing pedestrians with accurate, reliable, cheap, low power consuming and continuously available positional data inside the buildings (i.e. indoors) where GNSS signals are not usually available is difficult. Several positioning technologies can be applied as stand-alone indoor positioning technologies. They include Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Ultra-Wideband (UWB), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Tactile Floor (TF), Ultra Sound (US) and High Sensitivity GNSS (HSGNSS). This paper evaluates the practicality and fitness-to-the-purpose of pedestrian navigation for these stand-alone positioning technologies to identify the best one for the purpose of indoor pedestrian navigation. In this regard, the most important criteria defining a suitable positioning service for pedestrian navigation are identified and prioritised. They include accuracy, availability, cost, power consumption and privacy. Each technology is evaluated according to each criterion using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and finally the combination of all weighted criteria and technologies are processed to identify the most suitable solution.

Multi-source fusion-based localization is considered to be an effective way to provide location-based services in large-scale indoor areas. This paper presents an intelligent 3D indoor localization framework that uses the integration of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), quick response (QR) code, and micro-electro-mechanical system sensors (the 3D-WBQM framework). An enhanced inertial odometry was developed for accurate pedestrian localization and trajectory optimization in indoor spaces containing magnetic interference and external acceleration, and Wi-Fi fine time Measurement stations, BLE nodes, and QR codes were applied for landmark detection to provide an absolute reference for trajectory optimization and crowdsourced navigation database construction. In addition, the robust unscented Kalman filter (RUKF) was applied as a generic integrated model to combine the estimated location results from inertial odometry, BLE, QR, Wi-Fi FTM, and the crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprinting for large-scale indoor positioning. The experimental results indicated that the proposed 3D-WBQM framework was verified to realize autonomous and accurate positioning performance in large-scale indoor areas using different location sources, and meter-level positioning accuracy can be acquired in Wi-Fi FTM supported areas.

For this, green I3A smart factory (GreenISF) scenario is presented, where the deployment of a collaborative mesh network based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and long range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) technologies promotes human-machine collaboration towards socially sustainable factories. In order to encourage human-centric architectures in such environments, our smart wristband prototype OperaBLE is introduced in this paper as key enabler for human-in-the-loop systems. Thus, the network deployed in GreenISF is composed of body area networks which monitor labor activity and reinforce security at work by embedding sensors in regulatory industrial clothes. These networks cooperate with our BLE mesh infrastructure aimed to fulfill the major challenges Industry 4.0: zero fails, total coverage, and sustainability. Furthermore, a context information network based on LoRaWAN complements our mesh network to provide the system with valuable environmental data and prevent operators from harmful workplaces. The system is connected to a fog server responsible for preprocessing raw data that will be stored in a global cloud server. The experiments carried out highlight the contribution of OperaBLE towards safer working conditions and a sustainable digitalization of Industry 4.0.

Indoor positioning systems have a huge market in the retail sector and contextual advertising; in addition, they can be fundamental to increasing the quality of life for citizens if deployed inside public buildings such as hospitals, airports, and museums. Sometimes, in emergency situations, they can make the difference between life and death. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature. Recently, thanks to the high performance of smartphones' cameras, marker-less and marker-based computer vision approaches have been investigated. In a previous paper, we proposed a technique for indoor localization and navigation using both Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a 2D visual marker system deployed into the floor. In this paper, we presented a qualitative performance evaluation of three 2D visual markers, Vuforia, ArUco marker, and AprilTag, which are suitable for real-time applications. Our analysis focused on specific case study of visual markers placed onto the tiles, to improve the efficiency of our indoor localization and navigation approach by choosing the best visual marker system.

These devices are typically configured in connection-oriented hub-and-spoke model with the Master controller. With an end-objective of optimizing the capacity of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) centric systems, we share analytical models, experimental setup and experimental validation of these models. Using a current consumption model for commercially available BLE devices, analytical models are developed to obtain closed form expressions for performance metric like Current Consumption and Quality of Service. (QoS in BLE context will be impacted by Application Delay, Overall end-to-end Reliability, throughput, and Stability region). The work presented in this paper provides a way for Smartphones to control the Duration of Usage (DoU) of the connected accessories, while achieving a graceful application performance. Models presented in the paper capture both, connection-oriented and broadcast-based BLE communications systems. These models explicitly account for the system parameters such as data generation rate, communication buffer available at the Slave device, relative offsets in anchor points provided by Master to different connections, etc. These models feed into an adaptation algorithm running in the Master device to dynamically configure BLE connection parameters.

In this study, we demonstrate the capability to produce photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using this platform. To adhere to a low power budget for solar-powering, a 574nm green light source is used where the PPG from the radial artery would be obtained with minimal signal conditioning. The system incorporates two monocrystalline solar cells to charge the onboard 20mAh lithium polymer battery. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is used to tether the device to a smartphone that makes the phone an access point to a dedicated server for long term continuous storage of data. Two power management schemes have been proposed depending on the availability of solar energy. In low light situations, if the battery is low, the device obtains a 5-second PPG waveform every minute to consume an average power of 0.57 mW. In scenarios where the battery is at a sustainable voltage, the device is set to enter its normal 30 Hz acquisition mode, consuming around 13.7 mW. We also present our efforts towards improving the charge storage capacity of our on-board super-capacitor.

However, realizing self-powered sensors with excellent predictability and designability to accommodate diverse application requirements remains a significant challenge because of the randomness of the nanomaterials or micro/ nano-porous structures used. This report describes the development of a customizable and designable selfpowered pressure sensor based on the piezo-transmittance of opaque tilted structures. The light transmittance decreases with increasing pressure owing to the deformation of tilted structures. Piezo-transmittance sensors with various linear ranges were customized by rationally designing Young's moduli and structural parameters and optimizing cross-sectional architectures of tilted structures. The pressure sensor was fabricated by molding on 3D-printed master patterns comprising various tilted structures. Each customized sensor exhibits excellent static and dynamic responses, and responses are unaffected by light intensity, ambient temperature, and humidity. Finally, the piezo-transmittance sensors were applied to a self-powered wireless breath monitoring system that integrated flexible solar cell and Bluetooth Low Energy, an all-weather wind detection system with simultaneous signal processing and energy harvesting, and a real-time control system for teleoperated a robotic manipulation.

Gary			SiFu: A Generic and Robust Multimodal Signal Fusion Platform for Pervasive Localization	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Bayesian neural network and model averaging; data augmentation; fusion framework; generic platform; robust localization	INDOOR LOCALIZATION; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SYSTEM	We consider pervasive localization for a roaming user who may sample widely varying signal modes (GPS, WiFi, geomagnetism, Bluetooth low energy, etc.) and values over time and space. Previous works can only apply to specific (two or three) modes and environment, and cannot accommodate arbitrary signal modes and environmental changes due to signal noise, device heterogeneity, phone carriage states, etc. We propose SiFu, a simple, accurate, and generic multimodal signal fusion platform robust against environmental deviation from its design point. As a generic framework, SiFu treats a single-modal localization algorithm as a black box to embrace any existing, emerging or future signals with only incremental training. It employs Bayesian deep learning and data augmentation to mitigate the location bias of the single-modal localization algorithm and run-time deviation from the training data, respectively. Using a unified multimodal likelihood formulation and particle filter, it fuses with inertial sensor measurements for localization. We conduct extensive experiments in different venues (campus, mall, and subway station), and show that SiFu achieves significantly higher localization accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art (cutting the error by more than 20%). It is also robust against environmental variations (reducing error by 30%), even when the signal values deviate greatly from their original design settings.	[Wong, Man Yu; Lu, Qing Yan; Chan, S. -H.

Travelers can receive information relating to their position by using this application. We tried to use some psychological effects to increase travelers' satisfaction when they receive such information. Moreover, we tried to emphasize travel memories of the place (scenery, culture, food, etc.) to encourage them to revisit or inspire their friends to visit it. Our tests prove the usefulness of our sightseeing support application for enhancing the travel experience. However, we had not yet developed a function to provide information that met the travelers' intentions or needs. Moreover, it is hazardous to use a smartphone during walking, especially in an unfamiliar place. If a traveler uses a smartphone during walking, they might miss the beautiful scenery, historic buildings, and exotic atmosphere. We tried to adapt our sightseeing support application for use with a wearable device (smartwatch) to avoid using a smartphone during walking and introduced a prospect theory to evaluate information according to personal interest and behavior. Our experiments proved that our application provided the most appropriate sightseeing information to travelers and prevented danger during walking.

Monitoring and updating the battery statuses of the on-site BLE beacons is an essential task for reliable operation and timely maintenance of the infrastructure. However, unregulated frequent updates of the battery statuses result in stressing the beacon network management platform, possibly threatening the reliable operation of the infrastructure. Whereas too infrequent updates degrade the freshness and reliability of the updated information. Without a reliable estimation on battery status, management and timely battery replacement operation would be difficult. To address this issue, this paper presents an efficient update method of battery status for BLE beacon network that minimizes the stress on the management platform server. The proposed approach leverages the correlation in battery status information between certain beacons to reduce the number of necessary updates while retaining high accuracy. Necessary reference data estimation, reference data reliability checking, and error correction on the estimation are the three major components in the solution. An estimation model allows accurate estimation in the cold-start stage. Moreover, an error-correction model allows to check the reliability of reference data and make a correction on the estimated value.

The proposal includes a centralized system to forecast available indoor parking spaces, and a low-cost mobile application to obtain data of actual and predicted parking occupancy. The described scheme uses data from both sources bidirectionally so that the centralized forecast system is fed with data obtained with the distributed system based on smartphones, and vice versa. The mobile application uses different wireless technologies to provide the forecast system with actual parking data and receive from the system useful recommendations about where to park. Thus, the proposal can be used by any driver to easily find available parking spaces in indoor facilities. The client software developed for smartphones is a lightweight Android application that supplies precise indoor positioning systems based on Quick Response codes or Near Field Communication tags, and semi-precise indoor positioning systems based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated by conducting computer simulations and real experimentation with a preliminary implementation. The results have shown the strengths of the proposal in the reduction of the time and energy costs to find available parking spaces.

It could be considered also expensive since it often causes an increasing of traffic with a consequent increase of pollution. In this paper, we present a smart parking system that helps users to reach a free parking slot, in a small area or a city, using context-aware information to help in the process. The proposed solution does not require an existing infrastructure of sensors spread in parking areas since it exploits the potential of modern smartphones with their capability of recognizing user activity and position. This solution introduces an algorithm which compares routes of different drivers to find relations among them. A mechanism based on Bluetooth Low Energy Advertising (BLE Advertising) is then adopted to detect passengers and reduce the bias that would be introduced by the arrival of multiple users in the same parking area. To test the system we developed an application prototype that enables the gathering of contextual information and displays through a map an approximate distribution of free parking areas close to the user's position. A series of tests were performed to evaluate the system to estimate the advantages of a sensors-less architecture.

The use of rodents to acquire understanding of the function of neural circuits and of the physiological, genetic and developmental underpinnings of behaviour has been constrained by limitations in the scalability, automation and high-throughput operation of implanted wireless neural devices. Here we report scalable and modular hardware and software infrastructure for setting up and operating remotely programmable miniaturized wireless networks leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy for the study of the long-term behaviour of large groups of rodents. The integrated system allows for automated, scheduled and real-time experimentation via the simultaneous and independent use of multiple neural devices and equipment within and across laboratories. By measuring the locomotion, feeding, arousal and social behaviours of groups of mice or rats, we show that the system allows for bidirectional data transfer from readily available hardware, and that it can be used with programmable pharmacological or optogenetic stimulation. Scalable and modular wireless-network infrastructure should facilitate the remote operation of fully automated large-scale and long-term closed-loop experiments for the study of neural circuits and animal behaviour.

This trend increases the importance of network environments especially wireless network, to connect everything. A diverse range of things must be connected to a production site network, from production facilities, various sensors, and cameras, to people working on site. However, their locations are not necessarily fixed. The use of wireless networks to efficiently connect these things to the network is increasing. However, production sites need to change line arrangements in accordance with the products being manufactured, which disturbs the onsite radio environment, necessitating a redesign of the network configuration. The wide variety of connected devices, including sensors and production facilities use different wireless technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This situation is likely to cause signal interferences. Fujitsu offers technology to solve these challenges for customers and help them with the installation of wireless networks at their factories. This paper describes Fujitsu's wireless solution that ensures reliable wireless connections even at production sites with complex configurations. It also introduces its technology for visualizing a radio environment as a vital element for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the network, and its technology for designing the optimal wireless device configuration.

However, an adversary can maliciously influence such controls indirectly by manipulating the environment in which the sensors are monitoring, thereby granting privileges the adversary would otherwise not normally have. To address such context monitoring issues, we extend CASSEC by incorporating sentience-like constructs, which enable the emulation of "confidence", into our proximity-based access control model to grant the system the ability to make more inferable decisions based on the degree of reliability of extracted contextual information. In CASSEC 2.0, we evaluate our confidence constructs by implementing two new authentication mechanisms. Co-proximity authentication employs our time-based challenge-response protocol, which leverages Bluetooth Low Energy beacons as its underlying occupancy detection technology. Biometric authentication relies on the accelerometer and fingerprint sensors to measure behavioral and physiological user features to prevent unauthorized users from using an authorized user's device. We provide a feasibility study demonstrating how confidence constructs can improve the decision engine of context-aware access control systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, typical gait analysis has to be performed in a gait laboratory, which is inaccessible for a large population and cannot provide natural gait measures. In this paper, we present a novel sensor device, namely, Smart Insole, to tackle the challenge of efficient gait monitoring in real life. An array of electronic textile (eTextile)-based pressure sensors are integrated in the insole to fully measure the plantar pressure. Smart Insole is also equipped with a low-cost inertial measurement unit including a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and a three-axis magnetometer to capture the gait characteristics in motion. Smart Insole can offer precise acquisition of gait information. Meanwhile, it is lightweight, thin, and comfortable to wear, providing an unobtrusive way to perform the gait monitoring. Furthermore, a smartphone graphic user interface is developed to display the sensor data in real-time via Bluetooth low energy. We perform a set of experiments in four real-life scenes including hallway walking, ascending/descending stairs, and slope walking, where gait parameters and features are extracted. Finally, the limitation and improvement, wearability and usability, further work, and healthcare-related potential applications are discussed.

An air quality sensing device (BME680) was used to measure temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds in a classroom environment. Physical Activity of a person in the classroom was recorded concurrently using an accelerometer (ADXL335); data from devices were integrated through a Bluetooth low energy protocol. Heterogeneous sensor data were stored on a cloud database, which facilitated further analysis and visualization. Recording was undertaken in a computer laboratory with forty-five students. Statistical tests showed a positive correlation between carbon dioxide and air quality. However, there was no significant correlation between air quality and physical activity. Further recording was undertaken in a more controlled environment, a smaller room in which a high intensity training session was undertaken. This showed a positive correlation between physical activity and temperature and a negative correlation between humidity and physical activity. The Internet of things (IoT) can provide an ambient solution to assist with environmental monitoring and body worn activity trackers have achieved general user acceptance, but in real world applications technical issues persist with sensor calibration, reliability, device connectivity and data integration. Thus, the Internet of Everything, i.e., sensing, processing, and using environmental information provides significant recording and integration challenges.

The microsystem incorporates pressure, temperature, and inertial sensors and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication electronics; power is supplied via secondary battery, recharged using Qi wireless power transfer. Sensors and electronics are incorporated within a circuit board measuring 026.7 x 1.5 mm3 which is embedded in a package with volume < 25 cm3 and density < 1200 kg/m3. The small size and density permit enhanced buoyancy control and deployment through narrow apertures. The package is comprised of a fluorocarbon elastomer VitonTM shell, which provides the necessary mechanical and chemical protection, and is filled with low bulk density cenospheres, which reduce the overall density while still allowing pressure to be transferred to the board-mounted sensor. This integration approach allows reclamation and repackaging of the electronics for rapid evaluation in a variety of harsh environments. Microsystems were tested in laboratory conditions at pressures up to 41.5 MPa and temperatures up to the battery limit of 85 & DEG;C while successfully recording data for > 96 hours. The VitonTM packaging was tested in H2S, diesel fuel, and 15% brine. Microsystems were then successfully evaluated in field deployment conditions in an oilwell to a depth of 1290 m, recording pressure, temperature, and inertial data.

Environmental monitoring using Data Center Wireless Sensor Networks (DCWSNs) plays a central role in detecting and mitigating hotspots or over-cooling conditions. These networks often include thousands of sensors and require a reliable and power-efficient communication protocol. The Low Energy Monitoring Network (LEMoNet) is a two-tier DCWSN protocol that features Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for sensor communication in the first tier and leverages multi-gateway packet receptions in its second tier. This research studies the performance of LEMoNet in different DC topologies through the development of an analytical model. The model solves a multi-objective optimization problem to calculate two design parameters. The first parameter is the optimal number of gateways and an optimal location for each one. The second parameter is an optimal transition (TX) power for each sensor, subject to the application requirements. Evaluation results show that the optimal design includes one gateway on every other row. Also, the model reduces 65% of the sensors' power consumption via TX power optimization while Packet Reception Rate (PRR) is kept up at the level of 95%.

In this paper, we investigate the use of ultra-miniaturized wire-type monopole antennas for energy harvesting (EH) applications, as a method maximizing the effective collection area of a rectenna relative to its physical size, while not reducing the net DC output. The rectenna, operating in the 915 MHz band, is integrated with a simple carbon-based e-textile supercapacitor for direct energy conversion and storage. The integrated module is then demonstrated, for the first time, wirelessly-charging a Bluetooth Low Energy sensor node at over 1 m distance from a license-free Powercast transmitter. The 14.1 mF supercapacitor is charged using the e-textile rectenna filament in 83 s up to 4.14 V, from an incident power density of 23.9 mu W/cm(2) and a time-averaged efficiency over 40%, enabling the sensor node to sustain operation for 108 s after the wireless RF source is stopped. Compared to state-of-the-art RF energy harvesters, the proposed module achieves over five fold improvement in the RF to DC power harvesting efficiency normalized to the harvester's area.

J	Sigrist, L; Ahmed, R; Gomez, A; Thiele, L				Sigrist, Lukas; Ahmed, Rehan; Gomez, Andres; Thiele, Lothar			Harvesting-Aware Optimal Communication Scheme for Infrastructure-Less Sensing	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET OF THINGS			English	Article						Wireless sensing; optimization; energy harvesting; batteryless; infrastructure-less; Internet of Things		Sensing systems for long-term monitoring constitute an important part of the emerging Internet of Things. In this domain, energy harvesting and infrastructure-less communication enable truly autonomous and maintenance-free operation of sensor nodes gathering long-term environmental data. Due to the infrastructure-less nature of the communication, receivers are not always available. The variable energy provided by the environment and the receiver's mobility lead to non-deterministic node availability. In this work, we study infrastructure-less data transmission schemes to optimize communication when both senders and receivers exhibit intermittent behavior. We rely on the notion of data utility, describing the importance of sensed data to the receiver, to determine an optimal communication scheme. Deriving the communication policy that maximizes the utility of the received data is shown to be a convex optimization problem. The resulting scheme is implemented and validated on a batteryless Bluetooth Low Energy sensor node that communicates to commodity smartphones. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model accurately captures the application scenario with a maximum root-mean-square error of less than 0.016 in data reception probability. The communication scheme's adaptiveness to variable harvesting conditions is experimentally demonstrated under varying harvesting conditions and is shown to significantly increase the data utility.

The system exploits easily available building floor maps in raster form, with an easy conversion to vector model, eliminating the need of specially designed vector maps, thereby making the system scalable for large indoor maps and more implementation friendly. This also enables the vector map to be used in both Particle Filter based IMU tracking, and routing. Additionally, an efficient method for independent fusion of location information from phone IMU sensors and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons is demonstrated. The method caters both dynamic and static properties of the system state. Furthermore, the paper proposes a novel approach for estimating the distance from BLE beacons using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurement. InLoc can be readily used for any size of building floors for applications like tracking, routing and guiding system, emergency evacuation, meeting planners etc. requiring no separate effort to rebuild the vector map from scratch. The system yields a mean tracking error of less than 0.4m in location, and yields 0.9m as an average positioning error using fusion.

In contrast to prior content-aware or non-productive backscatter, BumbleBee overwrites tag information independently on any ambient BLE. The backscattered signal is dominated by the tag information and compliant with commodity ZigBee radios. Since BLE signals are widespread, BumbleBee enables the vision of pervasive ZigBee backscatter communication. We prototype BumbleBee using commodity BLE transmitters, an off-the-shelf FPGA, and commodity ZigBee receivers. Through extensive experiments and field studies, we show that BumbleBee works universally with ambient BLE and commodity receivers. Further, when the signal strength is -80 dBm, BumbleBee has a throughput of 218 kbps and 204 kbps in the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, respectively. The throughput improvement is up to 3x compared with the advanced non-productive backscatter system, Interscatter [1], and 32x over the content-aware backscatter system, FreeRider [2]. The bit error ratio (BER) is below 1% when the tag-to-receiver distance is 20 meters. As the first ambient ZigBee backscatter system that works universally with commodity transceivers, we believe BumbleBee takes a crucial step towards pervasive ZigBee backscatter communication.

Researchers have developed and worked on variegated technologies such as, Bluetooth Low Energy, motion planning, Received Signal Strength based fingerprinting and mapping for achieving localization. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are widely used in navigation that utilizes accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope to sense acceleration, magnetic field, and angular rate respectively for navigation. IMUs are not only available as wearable sensors but also present in smartphones that are widely carried by users nowadays. Thus, ubiquitous localization systems can be designed with smartphone based IMU sensors. Existing survey articles on indoor localization has mostly focused on the different technologies available, and the different approaches utilized. However, existing works on IMU sensing based user localization methods need special attention as they can be extended toward a ubiquitous localization system that requires minimal fingerprinting effort from the public buildings. Accordingly, the article focuses on providing in-depth knowledge of the working procedure and discusses the challenges smartphone IMU faces. The article also surveys the fusion-based techniques used in indoor positioning and presents a comparative study of the various approaches.

These effects are mainly mediated by photoreceptors containing the photopigment melanopsin, which has a peak sensitivity to short wavelength ('blue') light. Commercially available light sensors are commonly wrist-worn and report photopic illuminance and are calibrated to perceive visual brightness and hence cannot be used to investigate the nonvisual impacts of light. In this paper, we report the development of a wearable spectrophotometer designed to be worn as a pendant or affixed to clothing to capture spectral power density data close to eye level in the visible wavelength range 380-780 nm. From this, the relative impact of a given light stimulus can be determined for each photoreceptive input in the human eye by calculating effective illuminances. This device showed high accuracy for all effective illuminances while measuring a range of commonly encountered light sources by calibrating for directional response, dark noise, sensor saturation, non-linearity, stray-light and spectral response. Features of the device include IoT-integration, onboard data storage and processing, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled data transfer, and cloud storage in one cohesive unit.

Inaccurate occupancy information could result in a low comfort level and an energy waste. Existing occupancy detecting system relies on indirect and low-resolution environmental sensors, which potentially mislead facility managers and result in inefficiency in building energy use. In this study, the authors proposed a novel occupancy detection approach through a coupled indoor positioning system. The system integrates conventional k-nearest neighbor positioning algorithm and stochastic random walk algorithm to collect high-resolution occupancy data through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks. The proposed system is able to identify the meshed geospatial distribution of occupants, and to future track their movements in a network covered space. The detected occupancy meshes are suitable for direct implementation in building facility management since their operation is based on thermal zones rather than occupants' coordinates. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed system, the authors conducted a preliminary experiment in an institutional building. By comparing the positioning distance measurement metrics and matching parameters, the authors found the occupancy information detected by the proposed model is highly precise, accurate and reliable for the application in the building energy management.

Beacon positioning determination using current approaches is supported by pre-calculated formulas, for generic beacons, whereas the position can be accurately estimated with a low error up to a small distance; or based on fingerprinting the signal for the given space. In both cases, the accuracy variate depending on hardware specifications and other conditions such as beacon brand, wrap material, temperature, wind, location, surrounding interference, battery strength, among others. This paper introduces a method for beacon-based positioning, based on signal strength measurements at key distances for each beacon. This method allows for different beacon types, brands, and conditions. Depending on each situation (i.e., hardware and location) it is possible to adapt the distance measuring curve to minimize errors and support higher distances, while at the same time keeping good precision. Moreover, this paper also presents a comparison with traditional positioning method, using formulas for distance estimation, and then position triangulation. Performed tests took place at the library of the campus of the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu. Experimental results show that the proposed position technique has 13.2% better precision than triangulation, for distances up to 10 meters. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has shown that evacuation start time and evacuation behavior are related to the disaster survival rate: immediate evacuation increases the survival rate and evacuation-disruption caused by traffic congestion decreases it. Therefore, it can be assumed that guiding people to safe locations will increase the survival rate. The detection of the human mobility flow is a key to rescuing more people, because its analysis can help determine the appropriate evacuation routes toward which people should be guided. The objective of our research is to develop a system for detecting the human mobility flows in a disaster scenario. We analyzed the requirements of human mobility flow detection for disaster evacuation guidance. In this paper, we propose a crowd sensing system that uses Bluetooth for recognizing human mobility flows. By detecting Bluetooth devices carried by pedestrians, the congestion degree can be estimated. Further, the devices' movements can be detected by observing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) beacons carried by pedestrians. The results of experimental evaluations of these two methods verify their usefulness. Our methods can estimate the congestion degree, as well as the velocity of walking pedestrians.

It has great potential because of the ubiquitous smartphones and the cheapness of Bluetooth and WiFi infrastructures. However, the acquisition and maintenance of fingerprints require a lot of labor, which is a major obstacle in site survey. In this paper, we propose a radio map fast construction mechanism for Bluetooth low energy (BLE) fingerprint localization. The advertising interval of BLE beacon and the way of smartphones scanning BLE packets are different from WiFi. The lower interval of BLE packets and the mode of smartphone returning packets instantly both signify more refined fingerprints. Firstly, we reproduce the walking path based on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and sensor landmarks and then map BLE signals to the path finely, which helps the collection process. Then we develop a detection rule according to the probability of smartphone scanning BLE beacons in a short period of time, avoiding accidental BLE signals. Finally, BLE signals associated with estimated collection coordinates are used to predict fingerprints on untouched places by Gaussian process regression. Experiments demonstrate that our method has an average localization accuracy of 2.129 m under the premise of reducing the time overhead greatly.

Nevertheless, there has been no such a device to monitor fetal ECG (fECG) in spite of high fetus mortality rate due to heart diseases. In this work, we present a novel patch using non-contact electrodes (NCEs) to acquire the abdominal ECG (aECG) of the mother which comprises both fECG and maternal ECG (mECG) and a reference patch on mother's chest to extract mECG. The device is based on a polyimide film with NCEs and circuits, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication and a flexible Li-polymer battery. A MATLAB algorithm was developed to precisely extract the fECG and mECG using Linear Mean Square (LMS) adaptive filter. The system was characterized and validated using recorded ECG signals and an online database with zero error between Rpeaks of stabilized filter outputs and required signals. Therefore, our aECG and mECG patch hold promise to monitor the wellbeing states of both the fetus and mother in the home setting as well as provide data for early diagnoses of heart diseases even before the baby is born.

J	Le, MT; Tran, TP; Nguyen, QC				Le, Minh Thuy; Tran, Thu Phuong; Nguyen, Quoc Cuong			Wearable BLE Wireless Sensor Based on U-Shaped EBG Monopole Antenna	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							BODY; BANDWIDTH	In this paper, a compact wearable U-shaped monopole antenna operating at 2.4 GHz frequency band is proposed for Medical Body Area Network applications. The antenna has a compact size of 0.37 lambda x0.31 lambda, covering a band from 2.14 GHz to 3.03 GHz with a gain of 2.3 dBi at 2.45 GHz, and an efficiency of 93% in free space. In addition, an Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) metamaterial is utilized to isolate the integrated antenna on the circuit and the body, reducing the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). In consequence, an integrated circuit employing the EBG ground plane provides a safe value of SAR (0.68 W/kg) when it is attached to a human arm followed by a 74% reduction of SAR value compared to the circuit without EBG (2.57 W/kg). Furthermore, the on-body efficiency of the EBG-based antenna is improved from 54% to 73.68%. Finally, experimental results of a wearable heart rate and blood oxygen level BLE sensor based on the proposed U-shaped EBG monopole antenna exhibit an average power consumption of 108 mW, a sensitivity of -74 dBm, and a maximum Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmission distance with a mobile phone of 16 m in the complex environment.

For the outdoors, a GPS is used to navigate between two points. However, GPS technology does not work well indoors, and we have a weaker sense of direction when inside buildings. In particular, with the increase in the number of large-scale buildings, people more often have to navigate complex indoor spaces. To achieve indoor navigation, we need to know our current location, the intended destination, and the correct route. We can determine indoor reference points by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons as well as digital signage, which is widely used indoors for promotional and informational purposes. An indoor navigation system consists of digital signage, pre-installed BLE beacons, and a mobile application. When the mobile application computes the shortest path from the current location to the destination, a step-by-step navigational instruction graph is shown both on users' phones and on nearby digital signage until the user reaches the destination. We conducted an experiment and survey to understand users' attitudes toward the application. The result shows that most subjects find the system useful and easy to use and hold a positive or neutral attitude toward continuing to use it.

Social Distancing and Isolation Management Using Machine-to-Machine Technologies to Prevent Pandemics	CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA			English	Article						Coronavirus disease 2019; pandemic; machine-to-machine; industrial internet of things; social distance; geo-fencing	INFLUENZA; SECURITY	Social distancing and self-isolation management are crucial preventive measures that can save millions of lives during challenging pandemics of diseases such as the Spanish flu, swine flu, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study describes the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Industrial Internet of Things and machine-to-machine technologies for social distancing and smart self-isolation management. These technologies can help prevent outbreaks of any disease that can disperse widely and develop into a pandemic. Initially, a smart wristband is proposed that incorporates Bluetooth beacon technology to facilitate the tracing and tracking of Bluetooth Low Energy beacon packets for smart contact tracing. Second, the connectivity of the device with Android or iOS applications using long-term evolution technology is realized to achieve mobility. Finally, mathematical formulations are proposed to measure the distance between coordinates in order to detect geo-fencing violations. These formulations are specifically designed for the virtual circular and polygonal boundaries used to restrict suspected or infected persons from trespassing in predetermined areas, e.g., at home, in a hospital, or in an isolation ward. The proposed framework outperforms existing solutions, since it is implemented on a wider scale, provides a range of functionalities, and is cost-effective.

The capability to provide the users with added-value services through low-power and low-cost smart objects is very attractive in many fields. Among these, art and culture represent very interesting examples, as the tourism is one of the main driving engines of modern society. In this paper, we propose an IoT-aware architecture to improve the cultural experience of the user, by involving the most important recent innovations in the ICT field. The main components of the proposed architecture are: (i) an indoor localization service based on the Bluetooth Low Energy technology, (ii) a wearable device able to capture and process images related to the user's point of view, (iii) the user's mobile device useful to display customized cultural contents and to share multimedia data in the Cloud, and (iv) a processing center that manage the core of the whole business logic. In particular, it interacts with both wearable and mobile devices, and communicates with the outside world to retrieve contents from the Cloud and to provide services also to external users.

This article also validates the simulation results acquired from the in-house developed Ray Tracing (RT) tool with the BLE 5 measurements conducted in a corridor of the TUAS building, Aalto University. The performance metrics considered for the analysis are RSSI, throughput, and outage ratio. The impact of different transmission power on BLE 5 is also analyzed. The obtained simulation results indicate a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of about 4.6 dB between the measured and the simulated RSSI at 2.4 GHz frequency. By investigating these results, an adaptive PHY selection algorithm is proposed in this article. The adaptive PHY selection approach enhances the mean throughput of the system and improves the outage ratio as well. In the light of acquired results, the adaptive PHY selection scheme shows significant performance gain and is found more beneficial in the case of an environment with mixed RSSI samples, i.e., a mix of low and high RSSI values.

From the features to be owned by such CPSc, the paper derives some guidelines for their implementation. In particular, the paper suggests: i) the use of the secured version of the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to collect data taken by the sensors and to send commands to the actuators, ii) how to use the main types of devices, i.e., Wifi, RF and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), for pervasive monitoring and control, and iii) how to use an automation system integrated with MQTT to react timely to undesired events. The use of smartphones for data visualization and not for bridging control services and sensors/actuators is widely discussed. Also, the paper illustrates how CPSc may be implemented and some code examples are provided to contribute to the implementation. Alternative solutions to be compared in further studies are outlined. The proposed architecture is under testing in the I-HOSP project, an initiative supported by EC Regional Funds aiming to deploy a healthcare system to assist remotely patients affected by risky pathologies.

An IOT based Wearable Smart Glove for Remote Monitoring of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients	BIOSIGNALS: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES, VOL 4: BIOSIGNALS			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies (BIOSIGNALS)	FEB 22-24, 2019	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			Arduino; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Therapy; Smart Glove; E-textile; IOT; Bluetooth		Rheumatoid Arthritis is a disabling and painful disease of finger joints affecting mainly the elderly people and requiring continuous medications and physical therapy. Traditional arthritis measurements require labor intensive examination by clinical staff. These manual measurements are inaccurate and subject to observer variations. Nowadays the use of wearable technologies is spreading and rapidly becoming a trend promising to offer key benefits in the management of chronic diseases especially at home. Here, we propose an affordable Smart Glove instrument for assisting physiotherapists in remotely analysing patients finger flexions when performing diverse activities at home. An E-textile based glove uses flex and force sensors, and an Arduino platform to transmit motion data to the physiotherapists using a smart phone using a dedicated App. The flex sensor on the index finger detects and estimates the motion, a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Nano is used for processing and wireless transmission. The wearable smart glove uses a lithium ion 3.3V rechargeable 400mAH battery for consuming power. This Smart Glove also helps in monitoring the patient's response to either medication and/or diverse recommended movements. The data collected can be used to analyse the status of the patient with time and also in assisting care givers to change planned activities or exercises when needed.

A positioning system is presented that provides advanced information services based on two subsystems: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The first subsystem was intended to position users with not very high levels of accuracy and precision, but not too far from reality, and the second one was intended to position users with greater precision. It is designed for use in stations and terminals of public transportation systems in which the conditions are "hostile" or unfavourable. Experimental results demonstrate that, using different devices for both offline and online phase, RSS differences, Euclidean distance and comparing fingerprints with Weighted k-Nearest Neighbours (WKNN) algorithm, the system is able to position users with reasonable values of accuracy and precision: for Wi-Fi, with only 3 samples, depending on the orientation and compared with 3 neighbours, an average accuracy between 4.15 and 4.58m and a precision in the range 4-7m or less 90% of the time were obtained; for BLE, best accuracy results were obtained by comparison with 2 neighbours, giving a position error of 1.59m and a CDF value of 2.83m or less 90% of the time.

We have studied a novel approach to finding lost objects using active RFID. We hypothesize that users can deduce the location of a lost object from information about surrounding objects in an environment where RFID tags are attached to all personal belongings. To help find lost objects fromthe proximity between RFID tags, the system calculates the proximity between pairs of RFID tags from the RSSI series and estimates the groups of objects in the neighborhood. We developed a method for calculating the proximity of the lost object to those around it using a distance function between RSSI series and estimating the group by hierarchical clustering. There is no method to evaluate whether a combination is suitable for application purposes directly. Presently, different combinations of distance functions and clustering algorithms yield different clustering results. Thus, we propose the number of nearest neighbor candidates (NNNC) as the criterion to evaluate the clustering results. The simulation results show that the NNNC is an appropriate evaluation criterion for our system because it is able to exhaustively evaluate the combination of distance functions and clustering algorithms.

It is a highly contagious disease. In addition to the vaccination, social distancing and isolation of patients are proven to be one of the commonly used strategies to reduce the spread of disease. For efficient social distancing, contact tracing is a critical requirement in the incubation period of 14-days of the disease to contain any further spread. However, we identify that there is a lack of reliable and practical social interaction tracking methods and prediction methods for the probability of getting the disease. This paper focuses on user tracking and predicting the infection probability based on these social interactions. We first developed an energy-efficient BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) based social interaction tracking system to achieve this. Then, based on the collected data, we propose an algorithm to predict the possibility of getting the COVID-19. Finally, to show the practicality of our solution, we implemented a prototype with a mobile app and a web monitoring tool for healthcare authorities. In addition to that, to analyze the proposed algorithm's behaviour, we performed a simulation of the system using a graph-based model.

This short paper particularly reports an initial attempt of training a BLE propagation prediction model adaptive to "above-ceiling" environment, which is a key enabler for automation of the assignment process. Based on the 1.3 million RSSI sample data collected in a real building for one week, we trained the model with different parameters and discovered that RMSE of RSSI prediction has the following trend: 1) it decreases with the introduction of the obstacle features - the number of beams and the number of HVAC machines, and 2) it decreases with the increase of polynomial term degree. The best model so far has an RMSE of 4.832 dBm tested by 10-fold cross-validation. The methodology and quantified result of this initial attempt provide reference not only for the network assignment process but also for building BLE-mesh networks in the above-the-ceiling environment, which can be exploited for HVACs management or sensor data aggregation.

This is an interactive process with visualisation information that can help user's orientation inside unknown buildings and the data stored from different users can provide useful information about users' movements inside a public building. Beacons installed on the building at specific pre-defined positions emit signals that give a geographic position with an associated imprecision, related with Bluetooth's range. This uncertainty is handled by building layout and users' movement in a developed system that maps users' position, gives guidance, and stores user movements. This system is based on an App (Find Me!) for Android OS (Operating System) which captures the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal coming from the beacon(s) and shows, through a map, the location of the user's smartphone and guide him to the desired destination. Also, the beacons can deliver relevant context information. The application was tested by a panel of new and habitual campus users against traditional wayfinding alternatives yielding navigation times about 30% smaller, respectively.

This demands that construction professionals be more effective and organized to successfully complete their construction activities. However, recent research shows that current construction management techniques are ineffective. In addition, this research recognized the potential benefits of location awareness of construction resources in the construction management. The availability of location awareness information was identified to assist real-time decision making, provide more control over construction processes, and improve productivity and safety. In this context, this paper introduces an indoor location tracking system that integrates Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors and motion sensors with BIM. BLE Beacons were used to track a target by estimating its location. Motion sensors were used to enhance the quality of estimation. In addition, a BIM model was exploited to extract map knowledge for movement constraints. Two field tests were conducted at two indoor construction sites. Complex tracking scenarios were designed to thoroughly assess accuracy and reliability of the tracking system. The results demonstrated the capability of the proposed tracking system with an average accuracy of about 1 similar to 2 m, which indicated that the implementation of the BLE tracking system in construction applications would be effective and promising for potential widespread adoption.

Managing crowded museums: Visitors flow measurement, analysis, modeling, and optimization	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						IoT; Machine learning; Clustering; Tracking system; Museum simulator; Museum optimization	INDOOR ENVIRONMENT; BLUETOOTH TRACKING; MOVEMENT; EXPERIENCE; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; PLAN	We present an all-around study of the visitors flow in crowded museums: a combination of Lagrangian field measurements and statistical analyses enable us to create stochastic digital-twins of the guest dynamics, unlocking comfort-and safety-driven optimizations. Our case study is the Galleria Borghese museum in Rome (Italy), in which we performed a real-life data acquisition campaign. We specifically employ a Lagrangian IoT-based visitor tracking system based on Raspberry Pi receivers, displaced in fixed positions throughout the museum rooms, and on portable Bluetooth Low Energy beacons handed over to the visitors. Thanks to two algorithms: a sliding window-based statistical analysis and an MLP neural network, we filter the beacons RSSI and accurately reconstruct visitor trajectories at room-scale. Via a clustering analysis, hinged on an original Wasserstein-like trajectory-space metric, we analyze the visitors paths to get behavioral insights, including the most common flow patterns. On these bases, we build the transition matrix describing, in probability, the room-scale visitor flows. Such a matrix is the cornerstone of a stochastic model capable of generating visitor trajectories in silico.

The heliostat field requires a robust wireless communication network with sufficient range, bandwidth and low latencies to enable a high level of control over each heliostat. Currently several wireless communication technologies are available on the market such as LoRa and LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, ZigBee, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi and its variants. In this article these different wireless communication standards are investigated within the scope of a modular heliostat field. The advantages and disadvantages of each is discussed with regards to range, bandwidth, energy consumption, ease of implementation and latencies. Furthermore, different architectural designs for wireless networks are analysed. The Wi-Fi 6 standard (IEEE 802.11ax) operating in a star network topology is proposed for the modular heliostat field. This technology is able to operate with sufficient range, throughput and minimal latencies in a dense network such as the proposed CST plant. This work is part of the H2020 PREMA project, aiming to advance novel energy systems in the drying and pre-heating of furnace materials.

Currently available indoor positioning technologies differ in terms of accuracy, costs and effort, but have improved quickly in the last couple of years. It has been actively conducted research for estimating indoor location using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) level of Wi-Fi access points or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tags. WiFi signal is commonly used for the indoor positioning technology. However, It requires an external power source, more setup costs and expensive. BLE is inexpensive, small, have a long battery life and do not require an external energy source. Therefore, by adding some BLE tags we might be able to enhance the accuracy inexpensive way. In this paper, we propose a new type of indoor positioning method based on WiFi-BLE fusion with Fingerprinting method. WiFi RSSI and BLE RSSI are separately processed each one by a Naive Bayes Classifier. Then, Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) is used as the fusion classifier. Preliminary experimental result shows 2.55m error in case of the MLP output. Since the result is not as good as the ones using conventional method, further test and investigation needs to be performed.

Therefore, it is necessary to guarantee their reliability and security. This contribution presents an aerial tracking application for these devices, with the aim of providing a tool for tracking and tracing in certain situations. To ensure the reliability of the application, information protection mechanisms to guarantee confidentiality and integrity are included. Three main parts have been considered for the application design: a Web application, an Android application and the backend. The system follows a microservice structure over containers, allowing simple management and distribution. Two modes of operation are supported on the Android application, a Tracker Mode, which will be executed on a smartphone on board a drone (RPA), and a Client Mode executed by mobile devices on the ground. Users in Client Mode employ the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon mode to transmit information related to their positioning and trajectory. The user obtains this data via BLE and relays it using the 4G/5G network to a web server. The server allows the graphical representation of the data and its exploitation. Deployment is proposed in different scenarios, such as the supervision and control of public areas with capacity control or the tracking and localization of people in isolated environments.

Mitigating risks for pressure ulcers through sensors remains a challenge and a high requirement. A simple, low-cost, battery-free, multi-parameter passive wireless flexible sensor (MPWFS) for all-around pressure and temperature monitoring to prevent pressure ulcers is developed. The pressure sensing unit is fabricated with functional gradient-structured balsa wood and has high sensitivity of 0.34 kPa(-1) with a wide detection range of 0-20 kPa. The temperature sensing unit, which is 0.4 mm x 0.2 mm, is embedded in the surface of the pressure sensing unit, enabling temperature monitoring with a resolution of 0.1 degrees C. The flexible Radio Frequency energy-harvesting unit, data acquisition, and processing, as well as Bluetooth-Low-Energy wireless transmission, are integrated within a 20 mm x 20 mm unit. It acquires continuous temperature and pressure data without a battery at any position more than 1 m away from the power transmitter. Moreover, the combination of the sensor array design with a mobile terminal provides the MPWFS's various benefits, including tracking changes in the supine posture, warning about pressure ulcers, and monitoring falls out of bed. This study presents a new method for long-term bedridden patient care.

In this paper, we took a first step towards redressing this, through a comprehensive review and the design of a low-cost body area network (BAN) made of a set of wearables that allow physiological signals and human movements to be captured simultaneously. We used four different wearables: OpenBCI and three other open-hardware custom-made designs that communicate via bluetooth low energy (BLE) to an external computer-following the edge-computingconcept-hosting applications for data synchronization and storage. We obtained a large number of physiological signals (electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), breathing rate (BR), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST)) with which we analyzed internal states in general, but with a focus on stress. The findings show the reliability and feasibility of the proposed body area network (BAN) according to battery lifetime (greater than 15 h), packet loss rate (0% for our custom-made designs), and signal quality (signal-noise ratio (SNR) of 9.8 dB for the ECG circuit, and 61.6 dB for the EDA). Moreover, we conducted a preliminary experiment to gauge the main ECG features for stress detection during rest.

User location in outdoor spaces is measured with high accuracy using GPS. However, because the indoor reception of GPS signals is not smooth, this solution is not viable in indoor spaces. Many on-going studies are exploring new approaches for indoor location measurement. One popular technique involves using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values from the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to measure the distance between a mobile device and the beacons and then determining the position of the user in an indoor space by applying a positioning algorithm such as the trilateration method. However, it remains difficult to obtain accurate data because RSSI values are unstable owing to the influence of elements in the surrounding environment such as weather, humidity, physical barriers, and interference from other signals. In this paper, we propose an indoor location tracking system that improves performance by correcting unstable RSSI signals received from BLE beacons. We apply a filter algorithm based on the average filter and the Kalman filter to reduce the error range of results calculated using the RSSI values.

As it enables the fast roll-out of sensor and actuator networks, it is an important aspect within the Internet of Things (IoT). Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an underlying technology to implement such mesh networks has gained a lot of interest in recent years. The result was a variety of BLE meshing solutions that were not interoperable because of the lack of a common standard. This has changed recently with the advent of the Bluetooth Mesh standard. However, a detailed overview of how this standard operates, performs and how it tackles other issues concerning BLE mesh networking is missing. Therefore, this paper investigates this new technology thoroughly and evaluates its performance by means of three approaches, namely an experimental evaluation, a statistical approach and a graph-based simulation model, which can be used as the basis for future research. Apart from showing that consistent results are achieved by means of all three approaches, we also identify possible drawbacks and open issues that need to be dealt with.

These were developed within the framework of the i-Light research project that was funded by the European Union. The project targeted the development and initial evaluation of a configurable and cost-effective cyber-physical system for monitoring the safety of older adults who are living in their own homes. Localization hardware consists of a number of custom-developed devices that replace existing luminaires. In addition to lighting capabilities, they measure the strength of a Bluetooth Low Energy signal emitted by a wearable device on the user. Readings are recorded in real time and sent to a software server for analysis. We present a comparative evaluation of the accuracy achieved by several server-side algorithms, including Kalman filtering, a look-back heuristic as well as a neural network-based approach. It is known that approaches based on measuring signal strength are sensitive to the placement of walls, construction materials used, the presence of doors as well as existing furniture. As such, we evaluate the proposed approaches in two separate locations having distinct building characteristics. We show that the proposed techniques improve the accuracy of localization. As the final step, we evaluate our results against comparable existing approaches.

It exploits the number of thresholdcrossing events, generated by a full-custom acquisition board, from the surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals of three forearm muscles to detect four different movements of the wrist: flexion, extension, abduction and grasp. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has been trained with the signals acquired from ten subjects, who repeated ten times each gesture. To avoid correlation between training and testing dataset, the Leave One Subject Out (LOSO) cross-validation technique has been chosen. The average ATC classifier's accuracy is 92.87 %, only 5.34% below the results obtained feeding the same model with the sEMG features extracted from the raw sampled signals. The total latency of the algorithm, from the acquisition to the prediction, is 160 ms. Power consumption was considered too: with less than the power budget for one sampled sEMG channel, it is possible to acquire and transmit (through a Bluetooth low energy module) the eventdriven data of four sEMG channels, with an effective data rate of only 28 B/s. Obtained performance makes this technique suited for wearable systems or Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.

People suffering from a variety of diseases had been traditionally treated in hospitals for a long time. Fortunately, the current situation has been changing also thanks to relatively cheap body sensors and development of systems for home treatment. It brings inconsiderable cost savings and improves patients' comfort. On the other hand, it puts demands on the used technical infrastructure and home treatment system developers who must solve integration of different systems. A crucial point is a definition of unified data formats facilitating transfer and storage of data to/in remote databases. There are standards and APIs such as Zigbee, Bluetooth low energy or ANT+ that define a protocol for data transfer. However, they do not define a suitable format for long term data storing. In this paper, data coming from ANT+ sensors have been studied and metadata related to all kinds of body sensors and raw data and metadata specific to individual sensors have been defined. Then a framework organizing data and metadata obtained from ANT+ sensors into an open and general data format suitable for long term storage of sensor data is introduced. Finally, a sample use-case showing the transfer of data from a sensor into a data storage is presented.

However, existing tracing approaches can lead to severe privacy and security concerns, thereby preventing their secure and widespread use among communities. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes CoAvoid, an edge-based, privacy-preserved contact tracing system that features good dependability and usability. CoAvoid leverages the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API to achieve decent device compatibility and operating efficiency. It utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to detect close contact with other people and leverages GPS with fine-grained matching algorithms to verify user information. In addition, to enhance privacy protection, CoAvoid applies fuzzification and obfuscation measures to shelter sensitive data, making both servers and users agnostic to information of both low and high-risk populations. The evaluation demonstrates good efficacy and security of CoAvoid. Compared with four state-of-the-art contact tracing applications, CoAvoid can reduce the size of upload data by at least 90% and reduce the verification time by 92%. More importantly, CoAvoid can preserve user privacy and resist replay and wormhole attacks in all analysis scenarios.

C.; Cesana, Matteo			Accurate occupancy estimation with WiFi and bluetooth/BLE packet capture	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Occupancy estimation; Wi-Fi; Bluetooth/BLE	INDOOR ENVIRONMENT; OFFICE	The capillary spread of personal devices equipped with wireless communication capabilities has enabled a series of high level services which build on capturing and processing the data packets emitted by such devices. In this paper we tackle the problem of exploiting such a methodology to perform occupancy estimation, i.e., understanding how many people are present in a specific place, an information which is valuable in many scenarios (HVAC and lighting system control, building energy optimisation, allocation and reservation of spaces, etc.). Traditional systems for occupancy estimation rely either on environmental sensors (CO2, temperature, humidity) or video cameras, which both have drawbacks: the former have generally low accuracy, while the latter require high setup and maintenance costs. In this paper we depart from such traditional approaches and propose a cheap and accurate occupancy estimation system based on the capture of both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy management frames transmitted from users' devices. The system, implemented on low-cost hardware, leverages a supervised learning model to adapt to different spaces and transmits estimated occupancy information to a web-based dashboard. Experimental results in both indoor and outdoor uncontrolled scenarios demonstrate the validity of the proposed solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many nations have been operating a disaster communication network to decrease such damages. The disaster communication network can safely rescue the survivors, but it takes a lot of time to identify the location of the survivors and the disaster situation near the survivors. In order to reduce this time, the survivors themselves should be able to identify their location and the surrounding disaster situation information. In this paper, we are focused on the disaster situations that may occur in complicated and large buildings constructed based on the development of architectural engineering. The indoor disaster monitoring system was designed based on the Li-Fi technology and Bluetooth Low Energy technology to minize the damages to people and properies in the indoor disaster situations, and this system was named as the Li-Fi and wireless sensor networks-based monitoring system. Through this system, the survivor can communicate with the sensor nodes to decrease one's exposure to the disaster situations, and, thereby, find a safe exit or evacuate to a safe location to be on standby for rescue.

The proposed system consists of BLE tags, BLE/WiFi repeaters, and a fusion server. The BLE tag is a device which broadcasts BLE beacons. The BLE/WiFi repeaters collect the beacons transmitted from the tag and extract the received signal strength (RSS). The RSS values are then transmitted to the fusion server through WiFi, and the server will estimate the position of the BLE tag with RSS-based positioning algorithm. We propose an indoor positioning algorithm which is a hybrid from received signal strength indication (RSSI)-fingerprint and cell of origin (CoO) to estimate the BLE tag's location. Some modifications are made to typical RSSI-fingerprint and CoO algorithm to get better accuracy. The test results show 1.2 m to 1.4 m positioning accuracy. The size of the BLE tag is 1.7 cm in radius and 0.5 cm thick. Each BLE tag costs 3 US dollars. The current consumption of the tag is 50 mu A which can be used without charge for 136 days with a CR2025 battery.

This work considers human queuing behaviour which is a specific crowd behavior of groups. We design a plug-and-play system solution to the queue detection problem based on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) captured by multiple signal sniffers. The goal of this work is to determine if a device is in the queue based on only RSSIs. The key idea is to extract features not only from individual device's data but also mobility similarity between data from multiple devices and mobility correlation observed by multiple sniffers. Thus, we propose single-device feature extraction, cross-device feature extraction, and cross-sniffer feature extraction for model training and classification. We systematically conduct experiments with simulated queue movements to study the detection accuracy. Finally, we compare our signal-based approach against camera-based face detection approach in a real-world social event with a real human queue. The experimental results indicate that our approach can reach minimum accuracy of 77% and it significantly outperforms the camera-based face detection because people block each other's visibility whereas wireless signals can be detected without blocking.

However, low-power and low-rate wireless network technologies have emerged as the preferred choice (due to cheap procurement and maintenance cost, efficiency, and adaptability). Currently, these groups of wireless networks are adopted in homes, health, and business sectors. The increase in existing WSNs has resulted in the incompatibility of wireless network protocols and poses a problem that results in high acquisition or maintenance costs, increased complexity, reliability inadequacies in some instances, lack of uniformity within similar standards, and high energy consumption. To address this problem, we develop a novel machine-to-machine software-based brokerage application (known as JosNet) for interoperability and integration between Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, and Thread wireless network technologies. JosNet allows one network protocol to exchange data packets or commands with each other. In this paper, we present a novel working network brokerage model for a one-to-one network protocol to communication (e.g., from Zigbee to Bluetooth) or one-to-many network protocol communication (e.g., from Bluetooth to Zigbee, Thread, etc.) to securely send messages in a large-scale routing process for short or long-range connections. We also present a large-scale implementation of JosNet using a routing table for large areas. The results show an industry standard performance for end-to-end latency time and throughput.

The prerequisite of the optimal receiver is to obtain the likelihoods of the received samples under different state transitions. We propose to learn the trellis diagram real-time using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by a pilot sequence. This approach, termed as the online learning trellis diagram (OLTD), requires neither the channel state information (CSI) nor statistics of the noise, and can be incorporated into the classic Viterbi and the BCJR algorithm. In a channel with non-Gaussian noise, the OLTD method can significantly outperform the model-based methods that use Gaussian assumption. It requires much less training overhead than the state-of-the-art ANN-assisted methods. As an illustrative example, the OLTD-based BCJR is applied to a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) receiver trained only by a 256-sample pilot sequence. Moreover, the OLTD-based BCJR can accommodate for turbo equalization. As an interesting by-product, we propose an enhancement to the BLE standard by introducing a bit interleaver to its physical layer; the resultant improvement of the receiver sensitivity can make it a better fit for some Internet of Things (IoT) communications.

In this work, we build upon the experience from the BlindHelper smartphone outdoor pedestrian navigation app and present Blind MuseumTourer, a system for indoor interactive autonomous navigation for blind and visually impaired persons and groups (e.g., pupils), which has primarily addressed blind or visually impaired (BVI) accessibility and self-guided tours in museums. A pilot prototype has been developed and is currently under evaluation at the Tactual Museum with the collaboration of the Lighthouse for the Blind of Greece. This paper describes the functionality of the application and evaluates candidate indoor location determination technologies, such as wireless local area network (WLAN) and surface-mounted assistive tactile route indications combined with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and inertial dead-reckoning functionality, to come up with a reliable and highly accurate indoor positioning system adopting the latter solution. The developed concepts, including map matching, a key concept for indoor navigation, apply in a similar way to other indoor guidance use cases involving complex indoor places, such as in hospitals, shopping malls, airports, train stations, public and municipality buildings, office buildings, university buildings, hotel resorts, passenger ships, etc. The presented Android application is effectively a Blind IndoorGuide system for accurate and reliable blind indoor navigation.

Designing and developing them requires to face some research problems. A properly management of different types of sensors is very challenging but necessary in this area. A new wave of smart devices and systems brings customizable benefits for different users. Example of this are smart-phones, smart-bands, smart-watches, smart homes or smart cars. A successful combination of them bring interesting everyday life benefits. One of the most important problems that needs to be solved in a practical way is the so called "multi-users problem". Addressing it is fundamental for moving forward into a successful adoption in everyday life of the smart technologies mentioned before. Associating users and services in a spaces in which there are many possible combination of them, is a core task. This work proposes a novel system based on interactions between Android smart-phones and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology beacons to deal with the challenges of a multi-user smart environment. We process data collected in a smart environment populated by many users. In particular we associate data collected and beacons. This processing generates database log traces containing measurements related to single user activities, helping in better matching services with users.

The customer's requirement will increase day by day. Online shopping is mostly preferred by almost all over the world. But it is time consuming. Also from which site online shopping is done it is not feasible to customer as distance wise. To overcome this problem we are going to develop "Smart Shoppe Using Beacon". The goal of this research is to implement mobile based indoor positioning shopping application with the beacon solution based on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. For estimate the locations based on localizations we use RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). A triangulation algorithm is used for calculate the current location of mobile phone. Beacons provide accuracy in proximity and distance estimation. In our application customer saves their time because customer's gets notifications on mobile phone when they are pass through any malls or stores. When customer like any notification they react on that and they got the way to reach that store. Customer enters into store and get notification about nearer product. In form of notification they get discounts, offers, price, description, colors and reviews of previous customer. Customer can buy any product using application and pay the bill using mobile wallet.

For the resource efficient (indoor) positioning of mobile individuals an optimized distribution of the used sensors is necessary. The placement of beacons (sensors) in a building (indoor positioning) can be a difficult and laborious task, especially if done by hand. Multiple researchers already tried to tackle this problem using different algorithms and under the consideration of distinct use cases. However, none of the currently known methods incorporate constraint programming by using only Boolean variables. In this paper we tried to develop a new method for an efficient placement of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons in an indoor scenario. More specifically, we try to optimize the beacons for a trilateration algorithm used for indoor positioning. This algorithm requires that three beacons should be in range for every possible position in the building. In a next step the initially calculated beacon positions are further optimized. This is done by trying to reduce the number of beacons used. Afterwards we evaluate the quality of the beacon placements by comparing it against a manually optimized beacon placement and evaluating it in an existing building by checking the quality of multiple sample positions.

A higher order provides more attenuation for them but proportionally increases the power consumption and chip area. We present the procedure to determine the orders of a multistage CIC filter by using the analytical expressions of its output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and rejection in the signal band. The derived expressions first show a lower limit for the order to achieve the required SNR and then provide orders to satisfy the rejection requirements. A two-stage CIC filter consisting of 2nd- and 3rd-order CIC filters with a total decimation factor of 1024 is designed for a direct-RF sampling receiver complying with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in MATLAB/ Simulink. Simulations show that the CIC filter completely removes the folded quantization noise of a 2nd-order bandpass delta-sigma modulator and has a rejection of 63 dB for out-of-band blockers. The proposed procedure provides the lowest order of each CIC filter to enable the receiver to satisfy the SNR and out-of-band blocking requirements of BLE.

This paper presents a novel approach to measure the driver alertness, evaluated by a smartwatch device based on fusion of direct and indirect method. The driver chronic physiological state is monitor by adopting a photoplethysmography sensor on the driver finger that is connected to a wrist-type wearable device. A Bluetooth Low Energy module connected to the wearable device transmits the PPG data to the smartwatch in real-time. Meanwhile, the indirect method, driver steering wheel movement can be derived by utilizing the motion sensors integrated in the smartwatch which include a tri-axis accelerometer and a gyroscope sensors. The respiration signals can be derived from the PPG time-and frequency-domains attributes. The data obtained from both methods aforementioned are subsequently decomposed into relevant features in time, spectral context and phase space domain, and thus computes the alertness index. Here, the correlations between the extracted features and the subjective Koralinska Sleepiness Scale are studied as well along with the recorded experimental videos. This study reveals that the alertness index prediction accuracy can be reached up to 96.3% based on the descriptive extracted features.

Many countries had adopted stay-at-home or lockdown policies to control its spreading. However, prolonged stay-at-home can cause worse effects like economic crises, unemployment, food scarcity, and mental health problems of individuals. EasyBand2.0 is a wearable personal safety device that helps in social distancing and also helps in safe mobility. Under the IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) framework the wearable EasyBand2.0 device helps in social distancing, it avoids human-to-human contact and helps maintain a safer distance. EasyBand2.0 uses the Low Power BLE technology to sense distance between two user devices and alert them based on the distance and time spent in proximity. Safe mobility of people is also important as travel is resumed in all forms. This paper proposes a software application along with the easy band to further be integrated with a system that works based on GPS (Global Positioning System) or GIS (Geographic Information System) to provide travel logging for contact tracing without exposing personal data. A CARS (Context Aware Recommendation System) based safe zone recommender system is proposed in this paper to aid safe mobility.

Assessment of a three-axis on-rotor sensing performance for machining process monitoring: a case study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FILM SENSOR; DESIGN	Online monitoring of cutting conditions is essential in intelligent manufacturing, and vibrations are one of the most effective signals in monitoring machining conditions. Generally, traditional wired accelerometers should be installed on a motionless or stable platform, such as a tool holder or lathe bed, to sense vibrations. Such installation methods would cause the signals to suffer more serious noise interferences and a low signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in less sensitivity to valuable information. Therefore, this study developed a novel three-axis wireless on-rotor sensing (ORS) system for monitoring the turning process. The Micro Electromechanical System (MEMS) accelerometer sensor node can be mounted on a rotating workpiece or spindle rotor and is more sensitive in detecting the vibrations of the entire rotor system without any modification of the lathe system and interference in the cutting procedure. The processor, data acquisition, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0+ modules were developed and debugged to cooperate with a piezoelectric triaxial accelerometer, with a vibration amplitude not larger than +/- 16 g. A series of turning tests were conducted and the results were compared with those from the commercial wired accelerometers, which proved that the ORS system can measure the vibration signal of the rotor system more effectively and sensitively than wired accelerometers, thus demonstrating the accurate monitoring of machining parameters.

A Multidimensional Internet of Things Testbed System: Development and Evaluation	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								The technological breakthrough of the Internet of Things (IoT) drives the emergence of a wide scope of smart IoT solutions in different domains. Advancing the different technological aspects of these solutions requires effective IoT implementations and experimentations. This is widely addressed following low-cost and scalable methods such as analytical modeling and simulation. However, such methods are limited in capturing physical characteristics and network conditions in a realistic manner. Therefore, this paper presents an innovative IoT testbed system which facilitates practical experimentation of different IoT solutions in an effective environment. The testbed design was developed towards a general-purpose multidimensional support of different IoT properties including sensing, communication, gateway, energy management, data processing, and security. The implementation of the testbed was realized based on integrating a set of robust hardware components and developing a number of software modules. To illustrate its effectiveness, the testbed was utilized to experiment with energy efficiency of selected IoT communication technologies. This resulted in lower energy consumption using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology compared to the Zigbee and 6LoWPAN technologies. A further evaluation study of the system was carried out following the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). As the study results indicated, the system provides a simple yet efficient platform for conducting practical IoT experiments. It also had positive impact on users' behavior and attitude toward IoT experimentation.

Low cost and power efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology's ability to run maintenance-free for many years on a single coin cell battery provides an attractive methodology to realize accurate and low cost indoor spatial tracking. However an easy to deploy and accurate methodology still remains a problem of ongoing research interest. We propose a field deployable tracking system based on BLE beacon signals together with a particle filter based approach for online and real-time tracking of persons with a body-worn Bluetooth receiver to support fine grain human behavior observations. First, we develop the concept of generic sensor models for generalized indoor environments and build pluggable sensor models for re-use in unseen environments during deployment. Second, we exploit pose information and void constraints in our problem formulation to derive additional information about the person tracked. Third, we build the infrastructure to easily setup and operate our tracking system to support end-users to remotely track ambulating persons in real-time over a web-based interface. Fourth, we assess five different tracking methodologies together with two approaches for formulating pose information and show that our method of probabilistic multilateration including the modeling of pose leads to the best performance; a mean path estimation error of 23.5 cm in a new indoor environment.

IoMT is a common approach to smart city solutions that deliver long-term benefits to critical infrastructures, such as smart healthcare. Many of the IoMT devices in smart cities use Bluetooth technology for short-range communication due to its flexibility, low resource consumption, and flexibility. As smart healthcare applications rely on distributed control optimization, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) offer effective approaches to mitigate cyber-attacks. This paper presents a decentralized, predictive, DL-based process to autonomously detect and block malicious traffic and provide an end-to-end defense against network attacks in IoMT devices. Furthermore, we provide the BlueTack dataset for Bluetooth-based attacks against IoMT networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first intrusion detection dataset for Bluetooth classic and Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Using the BlueTack dataset, we devised a multi-layer intrusion detection method that uses deep-learning techniques. We propose a decentralized architecture for deploying this intrusion detection system on the edge nodes of a smart healthcare system that may be deployed in a smart city. The presented multi-layer intrusion detection models achieve performances in the range of 97-99.5% based on the F1 scores.

The circular shaped microstrip antenna is designed to resonate at 10 frequency bands from 3.2 to 19.1 GHz and hence it can be used for advance wireless communication applications. The designed antenna can be used in small handheld devices supporting communication protocols like Bluetooth 2.0, Bluetooth Low Energy, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Zigbee IEEE 802.15. 4, 2G/3G/4G/LTE-A, and 5G. The designed antenna can resonate at 10 different frequencies from 3.2 to 19.1 GHz (3.2, 5.3, 7.4, 9.6, 11.7, 13.2, 13.2, 13.7, 15.3, and 19.1 GHz). The bands of frequencies are specifically designed frequencies on which the designed circular-shaped microstrip patch antenna would work and can be modified and redesigned to work for a different dedicated application/protocol operating between the ranges of 3.2-19.10 GHz. At 10 different frequencies specified here, the observed values of S-parameter are lower than - 10 dB. The voltage standing wave ratios of the antenna at above frequencies are in between 1 and 2. As the antenna shows narrow band communication capabilities at these frequencies, the antenna can be used for a definite purpose with a definite frequency with no interference with other wireless communication system.

In this cases, location is computed relying on WiFi signals strength mapping. Recent Bluetooth low energy (BLE) provides new opportunities to explore positioning. In this work is studied how BLE beacons radio signals can be used for indoor location scenarios, as well as their precision. Additionally, this paper also introduces a method for beacon-based positioning, based on signal strength measurements at key distances for each beacon. This method allows to use different beacon types, brands, and location conditions/constraints. Depending on each situation (i.e., hardware and location) it is possible to adapt the distance measuring curve to minimize errors and support higher distances, while at the same time keeping good precision. Moreover, this paper also presents a comparison with traditional positioning method, using formulas for distance estimation, and the position triangulation. The proposed study is performed inside the campus of Viseu Polytechnic Institute, and tested using a group of students, each with his smart-phone, as proof of concept. Experimental results show that BLE allows having < 1.5 m error approximately 90% of the times, and the experimental results using the proposed location detection method show that the proposed position technique has 13.2% better precision than triangulation, for distances up to 10 m.

This paper demonstrates the design and deployment of a miniaturized capsule-based system for subdermal injection to provide real-time and continuous heart-rate, movement, and core-body-temperature measurements. The presented device incorporates sensors for photoplethysmography, motion detection, and temperature measurements. A bluetooth-low-energy enabled microcontroller configures the sensors, digitizes the sensor information, and wirelessly connects with external devices. The device is powered by a CR425 battery for this paper, and various other battery solutions are available based upon the use case. The design uses only commercially available integrated circuits in order to reduce the development cost and be modular. The encapsulation is a combination of medical epoxy and poly(methyl methacrylate) that fits within a 6-gauge hypodermic needle. The preliminary evaluation of the device included an in vitro assessment of its thermal response and measurement accuracy, the impact of one-month implantation on surrounding tissue, the power consumption with duty cycling of various sensors, and a measurement of physiological signals in a rat and a chicken. Having a form factor and implantation method similar to existing devices for animals, this novel system is a useful platform for both scientists and veterinarians to better study a diverse range of animals.

To realize remote long-term ECG monitoring, a low-power wireless wearable ECG monitoring device is proposed in this paper. The ECG monitoring device, abbreviated as ECGM, is designed based on ferroelectric microprocessor which provides ultra-low power consumption and contains four parts-MCU, BLE, Sensors and Power. The MCU part means circuit of MSP430FR2433, the core of ECGM. The BLE part is the CC2640R2F module applied for wireless transmission of the collected bio-signal data. And the sensors part includes several sensors like BMD101 used for monitoring bio-signals and motion of the wearer, while the Power part consists of battery circuit, charging circuit and 3.3V/1.8V/4.4V power supply circuit. The ECGM first collects ECG signals from the fabric electrodes adhered to wearers' chest, preprocesses the signals to eliminate the injected noise, and then transmit the output data to wearers' hand-held mobile phones through Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The wearers are enabled to acquire ECGs and other physiological parameters on their phones as well as some corresponding suggestions. The novelty of the system lies in the combination of low-power ECG sensor chip with ferroelectric microprocessor, thus achieving ultra-low power consumption and high signal quality.

This paper focuses on investigating the usage of electromyography and galvanic skin response to detect the driver fatigue symptoms. The study reveals that the variation of EMG signal patterns can be mapped to simulate the driving behavior. In the study, five attachment positions of EMG sensors are observed to indicate the best position of the mapping for wheel steering control behavior. Hereby, the study also reveals that the changing variations of EMGs in frequency-domain are excellent and significant fatigue indicator than the usual time-domain features. On the other hand, existing systems only focused on analyzing the signal pattern of GSR, but not the variation of GSR in accordance to frequency analysis, which is one of our main objectives study. The sensed EMGs and GSRs are transmitted to the mobile device via Bluetooth Low Energy. The analysis takes part in mobile device with implemented fatigue monitoring application. If the developed classifier indicates the driver vigilance level dropped to dangerous pre-defined threshold, a vibration warning will be triggered to alert the driver. In fact, the experiment results revealed that the significant differences in EMG and GSR features are managed to determine the driver fatigue in five seconds interval. The developed SVM classifier of mobile application shows average of 92% fatigue detection accuracy rate.

Low-power protocols like Zigbee and Bluetooth Low Energy have limited communication range, whereas long-range communication strategies like cellular and satellite networks are power-hungry. Technologies that use narrow-band communication like LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT have low spectral efficiency, leading to scalability issues. The goal of this work is to develop a communication framework that is energy efficient, long-range, and scalable. We propose, design, and prototype WiChronos, a communication paradigm that encodes information in the time interval between two narrowband symbols to drastically reduce the energy consumption in a wide area network with large number of senders. We leverage the low data-rate and relaxed latency requirements of such applications to achieve the desired features identified above. We design and implement chirp spread spectrum transmitter and receiver using off-the-shelf components to send the narrowband symbols. Based on our prototype, WiChronos achieves an impressive 60% improvement in battery life compared to state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies in transmission of payloads less than 10 bytes at experimentally verified distances of over 4 km. We also show that more than 1,000 WiChronos senders can co-exist with less than 5% collision probability under low traffic conditions.

Beyond the RSSI value in BLE-based passive indoor localization: let data speak	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 15TH EAI INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE AND UBIQUITOUS SYSTEMS: COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND SERVICES (MOBIQUITOUS 2018)			English	Proceedings Paper	15th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems - Computing, Networking and Services (Mobiquitous)	NOV 05-07, 2018	New York City, NY	EAI		BLE; indoor localization; passive systems; realistic datasets		In this paper we present the results obtained from a large experimental environment that makes use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as the core technology for a location estimation system. BLE is a common technology for this kind of geopositioning systems, but most of the existing proposals are based on the RSS (Received Signal Strength) value obtained by mobile smart devices from static emitters such as iBeacons or other similar tags. This is not our case, since we adopt a passive approach where monitors obtain advertising frames emitted by mobile BLE beacons with no computing capabilities. In our particular scenario, based on a commercial application of our system, we perform fast but exhaustive training procedures to produce an initial dataset that is then analyzed paying attention to important design parameters. A thorough analysis of the data by means of different data visualization techniques reveals valuable information about the behavior of the emitters, signal characterization, radio coverage and, mainly, possible features that can be employed lately by machine learning methods in order to provide accurate location estimations. This is useful to define a quick and continuous training life-cycle which enables the detection of inconsistent data or failures. Our analysis also suggests that a representation of the observations using alternative features provides similar or even better results than the RSS values in terms of efficiency and support for heterogeneous devices.

One of the biggest challenges in indoor location systems is to determine the actual indoor position of the user using a smart device (Phone, PC, etc...), due to their instability, cost, high-power consumption, low accuracy and low precision. To overcome those problems, we have designed, implemented and emulated an indoor location system based on RSSI (Receive Signal Strength indicator) of the Bluetooth low energy 4.0 (BLE). BLE 4.0 technology is more advantageous in terms of long life expectancy; our approach is based on the deployment of equidistant nodes on the ceiling. The nodes are programmed to broadcast a periodic beacon at a time-pace of 400ms and then to enter sleep mode. When a smart device enters within the broadcasting range, it locates the three access points (nodes) with the highest signal strength. This information can be calculated using one of the several localization algorithms (Trilateration). The proposed Trilateration algorithm can be easily implemented in the hardware due to its low complexity; the method can be successful even when using a few numbers of nodes. In average the system has about 0.5 similar to 1 meters of error.

Many artists may have perhaps a dozen different pedals, each with different settings, to produce the desired effect. This can cause a clunky transition from song to song or even section to section. The main goal of this project was to streamline the process of changing effects, eliminating the time needed to adjust the various dials and switches to get the targeted sound. A simple Android app was developed using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API to interface with an RFduino microcontroller. The app was designed to be controlled intuitively, with simple buttons and slide bars to control which effects and what settings are enabled. The RFduino programs a shift register to drive a relay network using BJTs. The relays are used to bypass different circuit elements to produce different effects. The RFduino also programs a digital potentiometer to change gain values, volume, and frequency of oscillation. Currently implemented effects include distortion, overdrive and variable frequency tremolo. The design is intended to be easily extendable to other effects such as chorus, phaser, flanger, etc. Using shift registers allows essentially unlimited expansion using only three GPIO pins. Each additional effect would only require additional relays to be installed and minor software modifications.

The objective of this paper is to reduce the energy consumption of edge devices. The proposed method uses an autoregressive (AR) model for spectral analysis instead of the discrete Fourier transform, and its calculation process is distributed to the edge device and a base station by considering the energy consumption tradeoff of the data processing and the data communication. In this paper, the Yule-Walker method is employed for the AR coefficient calculation. The calculation process of Yule-Walker method can be divided into two parts: an autocorrelation calculation and an AR coefficient calculation. The autocorrelation calculation is implemented in the edge devices, and its dedicated hardware is designed using Verilog HDL. Meanwhile, the AR coefficient is calculated in the base station and is used for the spectral analysis. According to this distributed processing approach, the energy consumption of the edge device can be reduced compared with conventional DFT approaches using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The system level energy consumption is evaluated assuming the IoT edge device, which has a wireless transceiver using Bluetooth low energy. The evaluation results show that the proposed method can reduce 79% of the edge device energy consumption for spectral analysis in a practical application.

In our proposed method, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons were carried by elderly people with dementia. We installed fixed receivers in the town where we conducted this study. We visualized the wandering route by using the reception history of the BLE beacon that can be acquired from the fixed receiver. In this paper, we aimed to develop an interface that enables us to check the history of actions to narrow down the search range when an elderly person with dementia is missing. Also, by using this interface, his/her family and caregivers can check that an elderly person with dementia is in a safe place. Particularly, (1) because the signal range of the BLE beacon has been improved, it became possible for some fixed receivers to receive signal, and this solved the problem of detecting an elderly person with dementia in the vicinity. Furthermore, (2) merely displaying the shortest route is insufficient for the purpose of searching for a wandering route, and it was necessary to be able to display detour routes. To deal with these two problems, we developed a method to acquire only the reception history of the BLE beacon that is considered necessary for route visualization.

Our study of the behavior of more than 200 types of BLE-equipped devices has led to a surprising discovery: the BLE protocol, despite its privacy provisions, fails to address the most basic threat of all-hiding the device's presence from curious adversaries. Revealing the device's existence is the stepping stone toward more serious threats that include user profiling/fingerprinting, behavior tracking, inference of sensitive information, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities on the device. With thousands of manufacturers and developers around the world, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to envision the viability of any privacy or security solution that requires changes to the devices or the BLE protocol. In this paper, we propose a new device-agnostic system, called BLE-Guardian, that protects the privacy of the users/environments equipped with BLE devices/IoTs. It enables the users and administrators to control those who discover, scan and connect to their devices. We have implemented BLE-Guardian using Ubertooth One, an off-the-shelf open Bluetooth development platform, facilitating its broad deployment. Our evaluation with real devices shows that BLE-Guardian effectively protects the users' privacy while incurring little overhead on the communicating BLE-devices.

Recently, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) received significant attention as a novel non-invasive neurostimulation technique with high spatial specificity. Despite the growing interest, the typical ultrasound brain stimulation study, especially for small animals, is limited to a single target of sonication. The constraint is associated with the complexity and the cost of the hardware system required to achieve multi-regional sonication. This work presented the development of a low-cost LIPUS system with a pair of single-element ultrasound transducers to address the above problem. The system was built with a multicore processor with an RF amplifier circuit. In addition, LIPUS device was incorporated with a wireless module (bluetooth low energy) and powered by a single 3.7 V battery. As a result, we achieved an ultrasound transmission with a central frequency of 380 kHz and a peak-to-peak pressure of 480 kPa from each ultrasound transducer. The developed system was further applied to anesthetized rats to investigate the difference between uni- and bilateral stimulation. A significant difference in cortical power density extracted from electroencephalogram signals was observed between uni- and bilateral LIPUS stimulation. The developed device provides an affordable solution to investigate the effects of LIPUS on functional interhemispheric connection.

In our model, the improvement in positioning can be formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem that a graph can represent. The graph regards users as nodes and our self-designed error functions between users as edges. In the graph, the nodes obtain the initial coordinates through Wi-Fi fingerprint positioning, and all error functions aggregate to a total error function to be solved. To improve the solution effect of the total error function and weaken the influence of measurement error, an information matrix, an edge selection principle, and a Huber kernel function are introduced. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to solve the total error function and the affine transformation estimation is used for the drifting solution. Through experiments, the influence of the threshold in the Huber kernel function is explored, the relationship between the number of nodes in the graph and the optimization effect is analyzed, and the impact of the distribution of nodes is researched. The experimental results show improvements in the positioning accuracy of four common Wi-Fi fingerprint-matching algorithms: KNN, WKNN, GK, and Stg.

Lower back or lumbar-pelvic movement monitoring is proven to be an effective method in tackling back pain problems. Significant applications of wearables in postural control therapies are crucial in the prevention of low back pain. These methods reduce costly hospitalization and allow the self-rehabilitation process. This research paper introduces a novel wearable sensing system to perform real-time 3D posture estimation for lower back healthcare. The real-time 3D system is divided into three components: a wearable device at the lumbar region; a wearable watch device; and a computer vision unit. These devices use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology for wireless communication. The wearable units utilise inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to perform position and orientation measurements of the body. The motion sensors are compact, cost-effective, and low power, which makes them more accessible and useful. The sensing system is developed and calibrated using practical data and cross-verified using real-world datasets. The computer vision system effectively estimates the human posture using enhanced machine learning algorithms with >97% accuracy. The research focuses on estimating the correct postures using dual-IMU and computer vision data.

In this article we show that such service induces significant threats and we propose a scheme that achieves privacy preserving crowd localization. Crowd localization applications leverage all their users to perform periodic BLE scan and detect the nearby tracked devices. The users run a smartphone application which periodically forwards the list of tracked devices seen in the vicinity. This allows a user to track the mobility of its tracked devices at a large scale. We show that these tags use public or random static addresses that identify the user. These addresses are sent to the tracking company server without modifications. Such a behavior puts unnecessary risk on the users as its mobility can be tracked by the tracking company and by any malicious person with a BLE smartphone. We propose a new architecture that performs crowd localization while preserving users privacy. Our proposal prevent tracking of the users localization by the company as well as any BLE capable adversary. Compared to the current proposals it has no impact on the sensors or smartphone's battery life. It doesn't impair the performance of the crowd localization. Its only downside is a slight increase of the computation cost for the tracking company servers when a user declare the loss of its device.

The combination of a gateway and devices with a wireless connection can provide flexibility, but there are limitations to the network capability of each gateway in terms of how many network connections can be accommodated. It would be possible to get rid of the constraint and provide further flexibility and stability if we could deal with multiple gateways and balance the connections. Therefore, we propose a dynamic reconfigurable wireless connection system that can hand over the device connection between gateways by introducing a driver management framework that migrates the driver module handling the network connection. We have implemented a prototype using smartphones as gateways, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors as devices, and a Web application that works on an extended Web runtime that can directly control a device from the application. The combination of these, composed by the user, can be migrated from the smartphone to other gateways (including the network connection) by dragging and dropping icons, after which the gateway and devices take over the combined task. We confirmed that the proposed architecture enables end users to utilize devices flexibly and can easily migrate the network connections of a particular service to another gateway.

The virus spreads faster indoors and in crowded places; therefore, there is a huge demand for contact tracing applications in indoor environments, such as hospitals and offices, in order to measure personnel proximity while placing as little load on them as possible. Contact tracing is a vital step in controlling and restricting pandemic spread; however, traditional contact tracing is time-consuming, exhausting, and ineffective. As a result, more research and application of smart digital contact tracing is necessary. As the Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable sensor device studies have grown in popularity, this work has been based on the practicality and successful implementation of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and radio frequency identification (RFID) IoT based wireless systems for achieving contact tracing. Our study presents autonomous, low-cost, long-battery-life wireless sensing systems for contact tracing applications in hospital/office environments; these systems are developed with off-the-shelf components and do not rely on end user participation in order to prevent any inconvenience. Performance evaluation of the two implemented systems is carried out under various real practical settings and scenarios; these two implemented centralised IoT contact tracing devices were tested and compared demonstrating their efficiency results.

In this work, we propose an innovative design for an IoT-based interoperable healthcare system to wirelessly monitor and classify patient status. To support our research, we identify gaps, and discuss standards, protocols and technologies based on works that use relevant IoT applications in healthcare. The proposed architecture is centered on several low-energy unobtrusive sensors attached to the patients' bodies, as well as their beds, which encompass data acquisition nodes linked to a smart gateway that aggregates data. The smart gateway is integrated with an existing hospital information system through the exchange of Electronic Health Records (EHR), making relevant patient data easily available to health professionals on systems which are familiar to them. A use case scenario is presented in order to fulfill functional and non-functional requirements and provide a better understanding of connection and communication between the distinct entities of the proposed architecture, which is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology at the data acquisition level, the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol at the internal level, and on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard at the higher level.

In day care center, caretakers are taking care records aiming to improve care receiver's Quality of Life (QoL). However, in the present situation, it is difficult for caretakers to record care receiver's activity in detail because each care worker needs to take care of several care receivers at the same time and it is a large burden. To reduce the burden of caretakers, many elderly monitoring systems have been proposed so far, but most of them are not effective in the sense that they force care receivers to use dedicated device such as smart phone and/or particular applications that are obtrusive and cumbersome for care receivers. In this paper, we propose a novel elderly monitoring system which can monitor movements/activity of multiple care receivers at the same time by estimating existence area of each of the care receivers, without burdening them. Our proposed system estimates multiple care receivers existence area only using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The feature of our proposed system is that it takes Movable-Beacon and Fixed Scanner style. We have validated the proposed system and confirmed that we can estimate multi-person's existence area at high accuracy using only BLE devices.

We designed Pulse-Glasses that are cloud-connected, wearable, smart eyeglasses for unobtrusive and continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. We 3D-printed the first prototype of Pulse-Glasses that use a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor on one of the nose-pads to collect HR data. We integrated other circuits including an embedded board with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a rechargeable battery inside the two temples of Pulse-Glasses. We implemented IoT functionalities such that HR data are recorded from Pulse-Glasses, visualized on an Android smartphone, and stored seamlessly on the cloud. In this paper, we present the developments of Pulse-Glasses hardware including IoT services and the preliminary results from validation experiments. We compared Pulse-Glasses with a laboratory ECG system to cross-validate HR data collected during various activities-sitting, talking, and walking-performed by a participant. We used Pulse-Glasses to record HR data of a driver to test IoT functionalities of location services and BLE and cloud connectivity. The first set of results is promising and demonstrates the prospect of Pulse-Glasses in the field of cloud-connected BSN.

Uncontrolled diabetes can cause severe damage to most internal body organs, probably leading to death. Particularly, nocturnal hypoglycemic that occur usually at night during sleep. Severe cases of these events can lead to seizures, fainting, loss of consciousness, and death. The current medical devices lack to give the warning to reduce the risk of acquiring nocturnal hypoglycemic events because they use only for glucose monitoring during waking times. Consequently, the main goal of this work is to design and implement a new wearable device to detect and monitor tremors, which occur when a user has hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The device can detect a frequency range of 4-12 Hz by using the accelerometer of Arduino Nano 33 BLE. It can send a signal to the phone application (app) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Once the phone receives a signal, the phone application can activate an alarm system to wake up the patient, call three selected contacts number, and universal emergency number. In case of the user is unresponsive, the app can provide the patient's location, name, and date of birth to the emergency contacts numbers and universal emergency number. Additionally, the device cost is economically feasible and competitive compared to other medical devices.

Integration of sub modules like Phase Frequency Detector (PFD), Charge Pump (CP), loop filter, Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and divider result into the PLL block Third order low pass filter is designed as loop filter to reduce magnitude of the reference spur sidebands. True Single Phase Clock (TSPC) architecture is used to design the divider as it has the advantage of a higher operating frequency. It also reduces the power consumption and propagation delay. QPSK modulation technique is incorporated in the proposed design of EDR-BLE transmitter. Power gating technique is handled in power management circuitry to function the modules with low power consumption. It is one of the optimum solutions provided for proper power management. Construction of the transmitter consisted of producing a detailed schematic of each modules constituted in the design. Finally, the output of the schematic design of EDR-BLE transmitter produced a clean signal for both the in-phase and quadrature phase signals. It is visualized with necessary terminologies in the final transient analysis response of the EDR-BLE transmitter.

To achieve low power, QVCO, LNA and split trans-conductance amplifier (TCA)s are sharing bias current in the first stage. Similarly, trans impedance amplifier (TIA) and 3rd order LPF sharing the second stage bias current. The use of split TCAs avoiding I/Q cross talk even with 50% local oscillator (LO) signal and a current driven passive mixer down converting single ended RF signal into differential base band signal without the use of RF balun. The programmable LPF enables the receiver to operate in both ZigBee and BLE modes. Optimum input matching is achieved independent of bond wire effects by the use of varactor in the LNA. The design includes gain variation to achieve linearity requirements. The UMC 180nm CMOS extracted results of the QLMVF cell show, 42.5dB of conversion gain, 10dB of noise figure, less than 15dB of S-11, -23dBm of 1dB compression, -8.5dBm of out band IIP3 and 57.6dB of spurious free dynamic range (SFDR).

However, two of the most popular IoT techniques, Bluetooth and ZigBee, can not be connected to LPWAN directly due to their very short communication distance (e.g., 30 meters). Our work, named as Symphony, implements an universal LPWAN on existing heterogeneous wireless devices by overcoming two challenges. First, Symphony achieves a long-range communication from both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and ZigBee to LoRaWAN, enabling these ubiquitously deployed low-power devices to access a base station from faraway. It is achieved by exploiting Narrow-Band Communication, where the BLE/ZigBee devices generate ultra narrow-band signals (i.e., single-tone sinusoidal signals) through payload manipulation, while the LoRaWAN base station detects these signals via its demodulator, which has a high receiver sensitivity for long range communication. Second, Symphony enables concurrent transmissions from heterogeneous radios (i.e., BLE, ZigBee and LoRa) at a LoRaWAN base station. This is achieved by Cross-Technology Parallel Decoding, which is able to disentangle and decode the interfering transmissions. Our evaluations on USRP and commodity devices reveal that Symphony achieves a concurrent wireless communication from BLE, ZigBee and LoRa commercial chips to a LoRaWAN base station over 500 meters, 16 x range extension over native BLE/ZigBee.

In this paper, we present a low-cost yet flexible and powerful hardware/ software platform for sensing, computation, and infrastructureless wireless communication. Since energy usage is a key issue for autonomous operation, we investigate the power requirements of various computing platforms, sensors and radio link technologies. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate several license-free radios (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa 433 MHz and 868 Mhz) in terms of their real-world communication ranges. To avoid wasting precious communication resources, we apply machine learning and imagebased concept detection on-device to remove irrelevant data before sending it. We also evaluate neural compute sticks to improve performance and optimize their power consumption in our scenario. The proposed hardware/ software platform consists of small, low-power sensor nodes based on microcontrollers, larger single board computer relay nodes that can also preprocess data, and Bluetooth Low Energy enabled smartphone add-ons to give mobile devices access to long range communication technology. Finally, a Linux distribution tailored to the specific needs in this application area is presented that makes deploying new relay nodes easy even for non-specialists.

Energy saving is one of the promises of Smart Buildings. This can be achieved by controlling the HVAC system, lights, and other energy consuming appliances in relation to the activities of people in the building. In particular, presence is an important factor to consider. By using beacons such as those based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and mobile phones, one can deduct occupancy information by interacting, over WiFi, with a central server. In the present study, we investigate BLE utilization for transmitting the occupancy data to the server using off-the-self devices with several parameters, e.g., distance, packet size, and line-of-sight state. Furthermore, we propose a utilization of size-constrained BLE packets for transmitting occupancy data, which was previously only possible by means of HTTP over WiFi. The result shows that it is possible to transmit occupancy data via BLE, despite of its resource constraints. Bluetooth is also shown to be about 30% more energy efficient than WiFi to perform occupancy data transmission, i.e., the mobile phone has 16 hours and 38 minutes of battery life when running on BLE communication scheme and 14 hours and 46 minutes in WiFi communication.

Despite the huge efforts made for localization using smartphone inertial sensors, its performance is still unsatisfactory in large open areas, such as halls, supermarkets, and museums, due to accumulated errors arising from the uncertainty of users' mobility and fluctuations of magnetic field. Regarding that, this paper presents iBILL, an indoor localization approach that jointly uses iBeacon and inertial sensors in large open areas. With users' real-time locations estimated by inertial sensors through an improved particle filter, we revise the algorithm of augmented particle filter to cope with fluctuations of magnetic field. When users enter vicinity of iBeacon devices clusters, their locations are accurately determined based on received signal strength of iBeacon devices, and accumulated errors can, therefore, be corrected. Proposed by Apple Inc. for developing LBS market, iBeacon is a type of Bluetooth low energy, and we characterize both the advantages and limitations of localization when it is utilized. Moreover, with the help of iBeacon devices, we also provide solutions of two localization problems that have long remained tough due to the increasingly large computational overhead and arbitrarily placed smartphones. Through extensive experiments in the library on our campus, we demonstrate that iBILL exhibits 90% errors within 3.5 m in large open areas.

Because it is unrealistic to manually monitor the number of riders on all buses in operation, a system that can automatically monitor congestion is necessary. The main goal of this paper's work is to automatically estimate the congestion level on a bus route with acceptable performance. For practical operation, it is necessary to design a system that does not infringe on the privacy of passengers and ensures the safety of passengers and the installation sites. In this paper, we propose a congestion estimation system that protects passengers' privacy and reduces the installation cost by using Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) signals as sensing data. The proposed system consists of (1) a sensing mechanism that acquires BLE signals emitted from passengers' mobile terminals in the bus and (2) a mechanism that estimates the degree of congestion in the bus from the data obtained by the sensing mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a data collection experiment on an actual bus route in cooperation with Nara Kotsu Co., Ltd. The results showed that the proposed system could estimate the number of passengers with a mean absolute error of 2.49 passengers (error rate of 38.8%).

These IoT devices usually implement wireless communication protocols under the IEEE 802 family of standards [2], [3], [4] as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and ZigBee. All these protocols communicate in the 2.4 GHz ISM free band using network structures made of two main nodes: A central node (CN) in charge of collecting the data from multiple devices and uploading it to the cloud, and multiple peripheral nodes (PN) which are simpler devices with limited power consumption so they can be battery operated. Typically, the larger amount of PN in any application are randomly placed sensors that communicate with a fixed CN. These PN are then expected to be highly integrated, cheap to manufacture, and energy efficient to extend their battery lifespan [5]. On top of that, they are required to keep an orientation insensitive communication link so a change of the relative position with respect to the CN does not result in disconnection. Thus, the antenna design for such devices becomes challenging as it has to be compact, low cost as well as provide a radiation pattern which is not dependent on the orientation of the device.

The article contains a description of a system intended for elderly people tracking. Two novel solutions have been implemented in the system: a hybrid localization algorithm and a method for wireless anchor nodes synchronization. The algorithm fuses results of time difference of arrival and received signal strength measurements in ultrawideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio interfaces, respectively. The system allows to change the intensity of UWB packets transmission to adapt localization accuracy and energy usage to current needs and applications. In order to simplify the system installation, communication between elements of the system infrastructure instead of wire interfaces is performed over wireless ones. The new wireless synchronization method proposed in the article consists in retransmission of UWB synchronization packets by selected anchor nodes. It allows for extension of the system coverage, which is limited by the short range of UWB transmission. The proposed solution was experimentally verified. The synchronization method was tested in a laboratory, and the whole system's performance was investigated in a typical flat. Exemplary results of the tests performed with older adult participation in their own homes are also included.

In addition, BLE based location services are deployed in many applications such as smart-buildings and industrial automation, where a scalable high-accuracy ranging solution is required for Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) and real-time ranging. In state-of-the-art phase-based ranging, the accurate distance between two devices is measured one-to-one for each pair separately, which is not energy and time efficient for large-scale and dense deployment. In this paper, therefore, we introduce two high-accuracy concurrent phase-based ranging solutions, named group ranging, for large-scale and dense applications to improve the energy-consumption and ranging duration. Through experiment and mathematical analysis, we show that our proposed group ranging can improve the ranging duration by a factor of around n - 1, whereby n represents the number of devices. Furthermore, in this paper, we study the effect of proposed solutions in ranging accuracy in the presence of Crystal Offset Difference (COD) and phase-noise at the two devices involved in ranging. In addition, we introduce a solution to compensate for the ranging offset due to the COD. Finally, we propose how our group ranging solutions can be combined into the BLE standard data link layer in both connection-oriented and connectionless modes of operation.

MEMS gas sensors are composed of four microheaters mounting heterogeneous sensing nanomaterials (SnO2 nanotubes and ZnO nanowires with/without a Pt catalyst) and operating power is only 6 mW per each heater. A comprehensive approach to control heaters and readout multiple resistive sensors is implemented on a printed circuit board through the combination of analog/digital signal processing and a highly reconfigurable circuit structure. A wide range of sensor resistance (1 k Omega-100 M Omega) can be read with a relative error less than 1% by adaptively adjusting the gain of a trans-impedance amplifier. Heater controller circuits are operated in a way to give optimized power for each heater, and the target power is maintained at a constant value to keep a stable temperature condition. The module's multiple gas sensing capability enables selectivity enhancement by principle component analysis (PCA). Operation mode is readily reprogrammed to give repetitive sleep mode, and it is demonstrated that fabricated sensors show decent response and recovery to frequent heater on/off repetition. For both of portable and stationary applications, Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi communication is realized through a RF-microcontroller combination system-on-chip (SoC). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The primary focus of research into such a theory is however, limited to solving the problem of localization accuracy. In this work, the motivation is to provide a solution to the current range limitations of an Indoor Position System (IPS) in the form of a framework "Cooperatively Applied Positioning Techniques Utilizing Range Extension (CAPTURE)". These range limitations are the culmination of well documented difficulties of localizing using wireless signals in such Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) environments. The coverage of a localization solution is still a new and challenging issue in the indoor environment. In this paper we implement a version of CAPTURE that uses Wi-Fi Direct and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE 4.0) that take advantage of mobile devices at the outer limits of an IPS to help extend its reach into blind spots, where devices cannot be currently located. CAPTURE is evaluated using a live test environment, where range estimations are recorded between cooperating devices. These range estimations are filtered before being placed into a positioning algorithm to locate lost devices. Finally the accuracy of CAPTURE is presented, demonstrating the achievable benefits of implementing CAPTURE as a solution to the problem of coverage in an Indoor environment.

A battery-less wireless implant for the continuous monitoring of vascular pressure, flow rate and temperature	NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access							ANIMAL-MODELS	Devices for monitoring blood haemodynamics can guide the perioperative management of patients with cardiovascular disease. Current technologies for this purpose are constrained by wired connections to external electronics, and wireless alternatives are restricted to monitoring of either blood pressure or blood flow. Here we report the design aspects and performance parameters of an integrated wireless sensor capable of implantation in the heart or in a blood vessel for simultaneous measurements of pressure, flow rate and temperature in real time. The sensor is controlled via long-range communication through a subcutaneously implanted and wirelessly powered Bluetooth Low Energy system-on-a-chip. The device can be delivered via a minimally invasive transcatheter procedure or it can be mounted on a passive medical device such as a stent, as we show for the case of the pulmonary artery in a pig model and the aorta and left ventricle in a sheep model, where the device performs comparably to clinical tools for monitoring of blood flow and pressure. Battery-less and wireless devices such as these that integrate capabilities for flow, pressure and temperature sensing offer the potential for continuous monitoring of blood haemodynamics in patients. A battery-less and wireless integrated sensor implanted in the heart or in a blood vessel can measure blood pressure, flow rate and temperature simultaneously and in real time, as shown in large animal models.

Recent advances propose the physical layer cross-technology communication to address these issues. However, existing CTC techniques commonly emulate the target waveform in the frequency domain (FDE). Despite their success, these FDE based techniques inherently suffer from high quantization errors and are insufficient for IoT applications that require high communication reliability. To improve the emulation accuracy, we are the first to introduce the time-domain emulation (TDE) that significantly outperforms FDE techniques in reducing quantization errors and offers reliable emulation even with limited sources, e.g., low modulation schemes. To validate our idea, we propose LTE2B, the first TDE based CTC work that enables LTE devices (e.g., smartphones) to transmit data frames demodulatable by Zig Bee and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices. We implement the LTE2B on commodity devices (Nexus 5X smartphone and CC2530/CC1350 ZigBee/BLE SoC) with only payload embedding by penetrating the extremely complicated LTE stack. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that TDE outperforms FDE, while LTE2B can achieve a robust (> 99% accuracy), long distance (> 400m) CTC performance under a full range of wireless configurations including indoor/outdoor, mobility, and duty-cycle settings.

Even though Proximity sensing is capable of delivering a correct interaction, it might have a problem for explicit interaction when exact distance estimation is required. Considering those interactive applications which are distance-dependent, this paper proposed an optimized support vector machine (O-SVM) on the cloud for distance estimation and a Kalman filter (KF) on the edge to obtain a near true RSS value from a list of RSS measurements. Four benchmark functions (i.e., two from Industries and two Machine Learning Techniques) have been used for performance evaluation. Simulation with real signal samples was conducted to verify the performance of our proposed algorithm. Besides examining the performance gain of our proposed solution over the four benchmark functions, we also implemented the proposed solution on a smartphone for practical testing to demonstrate its feasibility. The proposed solution not only outperforms the rest with significant performance gain, i.e., > 50% error reduction compared to the benchmark functions. Furthermore, practical implementation verified that our proposed approach is able to return the estimate distance in less than 1s, such real-time response is desirable for many delay-sensitive applications.

These diseases could be identified easily with the variations in the sound produced due to the heart activity. These sophisticated auscultations need important clinical experience and concentrated listening skills. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a portable system for the early detection of cardiac illnesses. This paper proposes a prototype model of a smart digital-stethoscope system to monitor patient's heart sounds and diagnose any abnormality in a real-time manner. This system consists of two subsystems that communicate wirelessly using Bluetooth low energy technology: A portable digital stethoscope subsystem, and a computer-based decision-making subsystem. The portable subsystem captures the heart sounds of the patient, filters and digitizes, and sends the captured heart sounds to a personal computer wirelessly to visualize the heart sounds and for further processing to make a decision if the heart sounds are normal or abnormal. Twenty-seven t-domain, f-domain, and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features were used to train a public database to identify the best-performing algorithm for classifying abnormal and normal heart sound (HS). The hyper parameter optimization, along with and without a feature reduction method, was tested to improve accuracy. The cost-adjusted optimized ensemble algorithm can produce 97% and 88% accuracy of classifying abnormal and normal HS, respectively.	[Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

An improved common mode charge redistribution algorithm is proposed for binary weighted SAR ADC. The proposed method uses available common mode voltage (V-CM) level for SAR ADC conversion, and this method reduces the switching power by more than 12% without any additional DAC driver as compared to merged capacitor switching (MCS). Mathematical analysis of the proposed switching scheme results in the lower or equal power consumption for every digital code as compared to MCS. A two stage dynamic latched comparator with adaptive power control (APC) technique is used to optimize the overall efficiency. Furthermore, to minimize the digital part power consumption, a modified asynchronous SAR logic with digitally controlled delay cells is proposed. High efficiency with low power consumption makes it suitable for low power devices especially for IEEE 802.15.1 IoT sensor based applications. The proposed prototype is implemented using 1P6M 55 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.

Here, a dual-port antenna is proposed, integrating an inductive coil with a broadband monopole for near- and far-field wearable WPT. The coil acts simultaneously as a High Frequency (HF) near-field power receiver and an Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) resonator, enabling the miniaturization of the enclosed broadband monopole, both fabricated using all-textile conductors. On-body, the antenna maintains a 10 dB return loss over a measured 135% fractional bandwidth while maintaining compactness (0.312x0.312 lambda(2)). The antenna is substrate-independent and is demonstrated on two textile substrates with different dielectric properties and thicknesses. In far-field mode, the rectenna maintains over 40% efficiency from sub-1 mu W/cm(2) power densities. In the near-field, a WPT efficiency up to 80% can be achieved. The simulated Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) shows up to 40 and 20 dBm power reception for HF and UHF operation, respectively, without exceeding the 1.7 W/kg limit. The far-field wearable rectenna is demonstrated powering a Bluetooth Low Energy node using a BQ25504 DC-DC converter from a best-in-class low power density of 0.88 and 0.55 mu W/cm(2) on-body and in-space, respectively.

The neural interface device has 4 identical 8-channel analog front-end (AFE) circuits for DRG recording with the mid-band gain of 60 dB within 9 Hz - 500 Hz, as well as a 16-channel AFE for EMG recording with the mid-band gain of 40 dB within 0.7 Hz - 105 Hz. To effectively stimulate target neurons by optogenetic neuromodulation, the neural interface device has 4 identical 4-channel programmable stimulation drivers that can deliver pulsating current up to 65 mA to the selected LED. To eliminate tethering effects, the neural interface device uses Bluetooth Low Energy radio to receive user-defined stimulation parameters (i.e., stimulation frequency, pulse width, LED current) and send the recording data. The neural interface is built in a form factor of a head-mounted device, or headstage device, which has a plug-in structure formed by two vertical functional boards and one horizontal substrate board, resulting in dimensions of 3 x 3 x 3.3 cm(3) and a weight of 6.5 g.

To provide flexibility, the system is modular and each sensor functions independently. The whole solution is small, compact, light, and wrist worn. It is working in low power consumption mode and operates for several hours. The device has two layers to implement the sensors and one layer for a warning system driver to enable the vibrating motor and beeper in emergency status. The forth layer is the hardware flex interface that is connected to the display and sound module and provides the possibility of the hardware extension for further development. The gas sensor node includes the sensor attached to the driver (located at the top) and is replaceable with other target gas sensors from the same family. The warning system is located at the bottom of the proposed device. The sampled data from the sensors are monitored in real time via the display and are sent to an Android smartphone for permanent storage via Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) 4.1. Consequently, these data will he directed to a cloud for further medical analyses. Power consumption, results, device efficiency, and packet protocol justification are evaluated in this paper.

This proposal uses different wireless technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi Direct and LTE Direct to enable device-to-device communications between users through their smartphones. In this way, the system allows the deployment of decentralized communications in fragmented scenarios, what is essential for disaster relief applications. The general procedure of the proposed system is based on the use of chat rooms with possibility of real-time streaming. Two different types of chat rooms are defined: public chat rooms with open access for all registered and authenticated users, and private chat rooms that can be used by different authorized groups of people. The permissions required to use different chat room are established thanks to the use of a decentralized authentication scheme based on public keys and certificate graphs, where different trust levels can be applied. The proposed scheme includes also a decision protocol to choose the most appropriate communication technology in every moment, and a power saving protocol that minimizes the impact of the system on the device's battery consumption. The first results of field experiments made with a beta application developed for Android smartphones are promising.

As sEMG signals have great value in clinical diagnosis and engineering research, the system is designed to obtain reliable and real-time sEMG signals. Because raw sEMG signals are faint and susceptible, the designed system provides several solutions to solve this problem. The multichannel method allows the system to detect muscle activities from 8 different positions simultaneously. To improve flexibility in practical applications, the Bluetooth Low Energy ( BLE) technology is equipped to realize wireless data transmission over a short-distance (12 m). Besides, for the purpose of reducing interferences within the system, hardware and software filters are both designed to improve the accuracy of themeasurement system. Advantages of the overall design include ease of wearing, high-resolution, and high reliability. With a sample rate of 2 kHz and a resolution of 24 bits, the acquisition unit was accomplished in a small 3D print shell (3.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 1.8 cm). The paper includes several sEMG signal detection experiments on healthy volunteers using the system and acquired data were confirmed to be reliable and practicable. Characteristics of the system were calibrated and the testing results have proved its good performance in sEMG signal detection.

This platform is comprised of two parts: the main device and the optional intensity module. The main device is functional independently, however, the intensity control module can be introduced on demand. The stimulation is achieved through the use of energy-efficient mu LEDs directly integrated in the custom-drawn fiber-based probes. Our platform can control up to 4 devices simultaneously and each device can control multiple LEDs in a given subject. Our hardware uses off-the-shelf components and has a plug and play structure, which allows for fast turn-over time and eliminates the need for complex surgeries. The rechargeable, battery-powered wireless platform uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and is capable of providing stable power and communication regardless of orientation. This presents a potential advantage over the battery-free, fully implantable systems that rely on wireless power transfer, which is typically direction-dependent, requires sophisticated implantation surgeries, and demands complex custom-built experimental apparatuses. Although the battery life is limited to several hours, this is sufficient to complete the majority of behavioral neuroscience experiments. Our platform consumes an average power of 0.5 mW, has a battery life of 12 hours.	[Orguc, S.; Sands, J.; Sahasrabudhe, A.; Anikeeva, P.; Chandrakasan, A.

However, the GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines do not provide specific recommendations about oxygen dosage during exercise. Also, previous studies have demonstrated that using resting arterial blood gases to regulate the flow of portable oxygen concentrator does not effectively prevent desaturation during activities of daily living (ADL). On the other hand, some clinicians prefer to individualize oxygen therapy during exercise using several types of stress tests which are mostly inaccurate comparing to the ADL, expensive and time consuming for both physician and patient. Because of the relationship between oxygen desaturation and some activity parameters such as walking velocity and number of steps, we have designed a portable device composed of an Android smartphone to monitor multiple activity parameters, a Pulse Oximeter and a Raspberry pi 3 which communicate with other devices through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in order to find out the relationship between each activity parameter and desaturation during ADL in order to help physicians to prescribe the proper supplementary oxygen therapy. Thanks to the use of Raspberry pi 3 with a powerful quad core microprocessor, other additional sensors equipped with BLE can be connected to the device to synchronously collect the more comprehensive data.

J	Basu, SS; Baert, M; Hoebeke, J				Basu, Subho Shankar; Baert, Mathias; Hoebeke, Jeroen			QoS Enabled Heterogeneous BLE Mesh Networks	JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS			English	Article						BLE mesh; QoS; end-to-end latency; traffic priority; reliability; network configuration and management	WIRELESS MESH	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a widely known short-range wireless technology used for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Recently, with the introduction of BLE mesh networks, this short-range barrier of BLE has been overcome. However, the added advantage of an extended range can come at the cost of a lower performance of these networks in terms of latency, throughput and reliability, as the core operation of BLE mesh is based on advertising and packet flooding. Hence, efficient management of the system is required to achieve a good performance of these networks and a smoother functioning in dense scenarios. As the number of configuration points in a standard mesh network is limited, this paper describes a novel set of standard compliant Quality of Service (QoS) extensions for BLE mesh networks. The resulting QoS features enable better traffic management in the mesh network, providing sufficient redundancy to achieve reliability whilst avoiding unnecessary packet flooding to reduce collisions, as well as the prioritization of certain traffic flows and the ability to control end-to-end latencies. The QoS-based system has been implemented and validated in a small-scale BLE mesh network and compared against a setup without any QoS support. The assessment in a small-scale test setup confirms that applying our QoS features can enhance these types of non-scheduled and random access networks in a significant way.

Specifically, researchers and clinicians have proposed that impairments of low back posture and movement, particularly during functional activities, are important to address during intervention. However, objective measures of posture and movement are typically only measured in the laboratory setting. Observation of posture and movement in laboratory is limited because people with LBP may not perform naturally when they arc being observed, and observation in a single session does not provide information about the duration of postures or frequency of movements across the day. In this paper, we present a wireless body sensor cluster formed by up to seven sensors in order to monitor spine posture and movement both in absolute and relative coordinate systems. The Body Kinematics Monitoring (BKM) system measures the magnitude and frequency of spine movements, and duration of spine postures in 3D, without impeding natural movement. The BKM node developed in this study is 3.0cm in diameter, and contains a 9-axis motion processor that records the raw inertial information of different spine regions. The system offers a standard Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to communicate with mobile or fixed hosts. The BKM system has been validated in the laboratory by measuring lumbar spine postures on a mechanical spine testing platform across a known range of angles.

A wireless and battery-less implant for multimodal closed-loop neuromodulation in small animals	NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access							RECORDING EEG; SLEEP; OPTOGENETICS; FREQUENCY; SYSTEMS; CORTEX; RATS	A tether-less and battery-less implant allows for the recording of electroencephalograms, electromyograms and body temperature in freely moving small animals, and for closed-loop neuromodulation via optogenetics and pharmacology. Fully implantable wireless systems for the recording and modulation of neural circuits that do not require physical tethers or batteries allow for studies that demand the use of unconstrained and freely behaving animals in isolation or in social groups. Moreover, feedback-control algorithms that can be executed within such devices without the need for remote computing eliminate virtual tethers and any associated latencies. Here we report a wireless and battery-less technology of this type, implanted subdermally along the back of freely moving small animals, for the autonomous recording of electroencephalograms, electromyograms and body temperature, and for closed-loop neuromodulation via optogenetics and pharmacology. The device incorporates a system-on-a-chip with Bluetooth Low Energy for data transmission and a compressed deep-learning module for autonomous operation, that offers neurorecording capabilities matching those of gold-standard wired systems. We also show the use of the implant in studies of sleep-wake regulation and for the programmable closed-loop pharmacological suppression of epileptic seizures via feedback from electroencephalography. The technology can support a broader range of applications in neuroscience and in biomedical research with small animals.

FaceMask: a Smart Personal Protective Equipment for Compliance Assessment of Best Practices to Control Pandemic	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS (ICHMS)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems (ICHMS)	SEP 08-10, 2021	Magdeburg, GERMANY	IEEE		personal protective equipment; smart mask; wearable device; body sensor network; machine learning		Disposable and reusable face masks represent one of the key personal protective equipment (PPE) against COVID19 pandemic and their use in public environments is mandatory in many countries. According to the intended use, there exist different types of masks with varying level of filtration. World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a set of best practices and guidelines to the correct use of this fundamental PPE. Nevertheless, many people tend to neglect wearing the mask in presence of other people and to unintentionally overuse the mask before replacement, which results in increased exposure to airborne infections. This paper proposes the development of a smart wearable computing system, consisting of a reusable face mask augmented with sensing elements and wireless connected to a personal mobile device, to recognize correct positioning of the face and capable to monitor other parameters such as usage time. Specifically, we realized a 3D printed mask prototype with replaceable filter and equipped with a small electronic embedded device. The mask collects internal and external parameters including humidity, temperature, volatile organic compounds (VOC) inside the mask, inertial motion, and external temperature and light. Collected data are transmitted over Bluetooth Low Energy to a smartphone responsible of performing signal pre-processing and position classification. Two machine learning algorithms are compared and obtained results from real experiments showed SVM performed slightly better than Naive Bayes, 98% and 97% accuracy, respectively.

The information obtained by a parent or guardian in existing monitoring systems, however, indicates only that the child and a monitoring person have passed each other and the time and place of that pass-by. Considering such information to be insufficient for child monitoring, we developed a beacon device incorporating a GPS module and investigated a monitoring system using this device. Specifically, we proposed a method for detecting a "potentially dangerous area" that we define as some area where children are playing with no monitoring adults present within a larger specified zone. We also proposed a method for obtaining a child's route and location history. In an experiment using a prototype beacon device and smartphone application, we observed the amount of data transmitted and transmission success rate when performing pass-by communications. It was found that 53.5 seconds were needed on average to transfer 120 records of GPS data and that transmissions could be successfully performed at a distance of approximately 80 meters. For a single device/smartphone pass-by, a transmission lasting about 70 seconds could be made and approximately 160 records of GPS data could be transferred.

The majority of these devices are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled. Though the advantages offered by BLE-enabled WHMDs in tracking, diagnosing, and intervening with patients are substantial, the risk of cyberattacks on these devices is likely to increase with device complexity and new communication protocols. Furthermore, vendors face risk and financial tradeoffs between speed to market and ensuring device security in all situations. Previous research has explored the security and privacy of such devices by manually testing popular BLE-enabled WHMDs in the market and generally discussed categories of possible attacks, while mostly focused on IP devices. In thiswork, we propose a newsemi-automated framework that can be used to identify and discover both known and unknown vulnerabilities in WHMDs. To demonstrate its implementation, we validate it with a number of commercially available BLE-enabled enabled wearable devices. Our results show that the devices are vulnerable to a number of attacks, including eavesdropping, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks. The proposed framework could therefore be used to evaluate potential devices before adoption into a secure network or, ideally, during the design and implementation of new devices.

To provide a real-time indoor position system with high precision and stability is necessary under many circumstances. In a real-time position scenario, gross errors of the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) fingerprint method are more easily occurring and the heading angle of the pedestrian will drift without acceleration and magnetic field compensation. A real-time BLE/pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) integrated system by using an improved robust filter has been proposed. In the PDR method, the improved Mahony complementary filter based on the pedestrian motion states is adopted to estimate the heading angle reducing the drift error. Then, an improved robust filter is utilized to detect and restrain the gross error of the BLE fingerprint method. The robust filter detected the gross error at different granularity by constructing a robust vector changing the observation covariance matrix of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) adaptively when the application is running. Several experiments are conducted in the true position scenario. The mean position accuracy obtained by the proposed method in the experiment is 0.844 m and RMSE is 0.74 m. Compared with the classic EKF, these two values are increased by 38% and 18%, respectively. The results show that the improved filter can avoid the gross error in the BLE method and provide high precision and scalability in indoor position service.

Numerous studies, and clinical service experience, have revealed that the intervention of nonpharmacological management for people with dementia is effective in delaying the degeneration caused by dementia. Due to recent rapid developments in information and communications technology, many innovative research and development and cross-domain applications have been effectively used in the dementia care environment. This study proposed a new short-term memory support and cognitive training application technology, a "positioning and shadowing system," to delay short-term memory degeneration in dementia. Training courses that integrate physical and digital technologies for the indoor location of patients with dementia were constructed using technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, fingerprint location algorithm, and short-range wireless communication. The Internet of Things was effectively applied to a clinical training environment for short-term memory. A pilot test verified that the results demonstrated learning effects in cognitive training and that the system can assist medical personnel in training and nursing work. Participants responded with favorable feedback regarding course satisfaction and system usability. This study can be used as a reference for future digital smart cognitive training that allows observation of the performance of patients with dementia in activities of daily living.

This problem is amplified fir applications like mobile payment; device control or secure pairing that, requires authentication. In this paper, we present an active LED tag system called (GLITTER that uses a combination of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and modulated LEDs to anchor AR content, with no a priori training or labeling of art environment. Unlike traditional optical markers that encode data spatially, each active optical marker encodes a tag's identifier by blinking over time, improving both the tag density and range compared to AR tags and QR codes. We show that, with a low-power BLE-ertabled micro-controller and a single 5 mm LED, we are able to accurately link AR content from potentially hundreds of tags simultaneously on a standard mobile phone from as far as 30 meters. Expanding upon this; using active optical markers as a primitive; we show how a constellation of active optical markers can be used for full 3D pose estimation, which is required for many AR applications, using either a single LED on a planar surface or two or MOW arbitrarily positioned LEDs. Our design supports 108 unique codes in a single field of view with a detection latency of less than 400 its even when held by hand.

IoT-enabled Building Management Systems provide means for process and resource usage automation leading to overall efficiency improvements. Inferring spatial and temporal occupancy in all its forms (binary, numerical or continuous) is one of the key contextual inputs required for smart building management systems. In this work, we showcase design, implementation and experimental validation of a smart building occupancy detection and forecasting solution. The presented solution comprises three main building blocks: (1) A fog computing indoor positioning system (BLEMAT - Bluetooth Low Energy Microlocation Asset Tracking) which, combined with wireless access network monitoring processes, produces indoor location information in a semi-unsupervised manner; (2) Data analysis and pattern searching pipelines responsible for fusing data coming from different smart building and networking systems and deriving information on temporal and spatial occupancy patterns; (3) Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks trained to predict occupancy patterns in different areas of a smart building. Data analysis and neural network training are conducted on real-world smart building dataset which authors provide in public online repository. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed solution can provide actionable occupancy detection and prediction information, required by smart building management systems.

The latter ones demonstrate higher electrical conductivities (up to 2700 S cm-1) and enhanced charge mobilities (18 cm2 V-1 s-1). The morphological analysis reveals differences mostly due to the very different nature of the deposition processes. The film deposited via ALD shows an increased transmittance in the visible range and a very small one in the infrared range that leads to a figure of merit of 0.009 omega-1 (10 times higher than for the films deposited via sputtering). A benchmarking is made with an RF sputtered indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) film used conventionally in the industry. Another comparison between ZnO, Al:ZnO (AZO), and Ga:ZnO (GZO) films fabricated by ALD is presented, and the evolution of physical properties with doping is evidenced. Finally, we processed GZO thin films on a glass substrate into patterned transparent patch antennas to demonstrate an application case of short-range communication by means of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The GZO transparent antennas' performances are compared to a reference ITO antenna on a glass substrate and a conventional copper antenna on FR4 PCB. The results highlight the possibility to use the transparent GZO antenna for reliable short-range communication and the achievability of an antenna entirely processed by ALD.

Traditional systems only support such requirements in stationary applications where a constant power supply is available. Trends toward remote healthcare and telemedicine require wearable devices, able to provide similar functionalities in wireless mode. Miniaturized and thin form factors, desirable in wearable applications, set stringent constraints on the available power, and consequently on the accuracy and lifetime. Energy harvesting combined with low-power design and energy efficient processing can significantly extend the lifetime of wearable devices. This paper presents a wearable pulse oximeter assembled in a 3D ring-like geometry that achieves self-sustainability by exploiting efficient power management, solar energy harvesting, and ultra-low power processing in a multi-core microcontroller. The design strategy of combining onboard processing to monitor blood oxygenation and the transmission of only relevant information via a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) interface, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption. Experimental results on the designed and developed prototype demonstrate that measuring the blood oxygenation once every minute with a sampling rate of 100 samples/s achieve accurate results at the daily energy consumption of 28 J including hourly BLE transmissions. The low-power design allows the system to be self-sustainable with just 64 min of sunlight per day or 12 hrs. of indoor home light.

The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is independent of the accumulative error, but the positioning accuracy is suffered by the irregular jump error resulted from the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) jitter. Considering the requirement of accurate, seamless, and consecutive positioning by the existing commercial systems, we propose a new integrated BLE and MEMS Wireless (BMW) system for multi-floor positioning. In concrete terms, first of all, the way of fingerprint database construction with the reduced workload is introduced. Second, the fingerprint database is denoised by the process of affinity propagation clustering, outlier detection, and RSSI filtering. Third, the robust M estimation-based extended Kalman filter is applied to estimate the two-dimensional coordinates of the target on each floor. Finally, the barometer data are used to calculate the height of the target. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed system can not only restrain the accumulative error caused by the MEMS sensors but also eliminate the irregular jump error from the BLE RSSI jitter. In an actual multi-floor environment, the proposed system is verified to be able to achieve the Root Mean Square (RMS) positioning error within 1 m.

Most fare payment systems are a fusion of NFC and mobile payment. As the latest fare payment system, the studies on gate-free technology without tag action are in progress. The gate-free system has several advantages, such as improving user convenience, eliminating congestion, and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. We introduce a gate-free system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology as the next-generation fare payment system for public transportation. We propose a smart block structure for a gate-free system and analyze the antenna for this structure. A directional antenna is required for location detection of multiple mobile terminals in the gate-free zone, and an antenna to satisfy the requirements is analyzed. A stacked air-gap patch array that satisfies BLE performance and has high directivity has been proposed within the limited smart block size. To compensate for the low bandwidth of the patch antenna, an air gap is added between the patch radiator and the ground, and the antenna gain is increased by applying a stacked patch on the patch radiator. Based on the proposed antenna and smart block, a gate-free system testbed is installed, and the testing results are presented.

J	Luo, RC; Hsiao, TJ				Luo, Ren C.; Hsiao, Tung-Jung			Indoor Localization System Based on Hybrid Wi-Fi/BLE and Hierarchical Topological Fingerprinting Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						BLE beacons deployment; Wi-Fi fingerprinting; hybrid indoor localization; topological localization	RECOGNITION; RGB	Wi-Fi-based localization using received signal strength (RSS) with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm is widely used to track pedestrians in indoor environments. However, the unsatisfactory deployment of Wi-Fi access points (APs) in buildings and the unstable performance of PDR are still key problems that lead to low localization accuracy. In this paper, we make contributions on proposing a hybrid Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) indoor localization system (ILS) based on an efficient BLE deployment strategy and hierarchical topological fingerprinting (HTF). For the BLE deployment strategy, we deploy BLE beacons in places that do not have clear Wi-Fi signals for localization. This efficiently increases the localization accuracy. For HTF, we hierarchically localize targets based on a topological fingerprint (TF) map. First of all, we quickly localize the room in which the target is located by Dendogram-based support vector machine (DSVM). Then, the specific position of the target is estimated by fusing Wi-Fi and BLE signals with the TF map. The new BLE-based fingerprinting algorithm is used to localize targets in environments sparsely populated by BLE beacons. We conduct physical experiments in a real building. The experimental results demonstrate that the beacons deployed based on our proposed deployment strategy results in greater localization accuracy. Furthermore, the HTF approach performs better than the other commonly used localization methods.

Bluetooth Mesh is an emerging networking technology, which can be used to organize a massive network with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Managed-flooding protocol is used in Bluetooth Mesh to route the data packets. Although it is a highly desirable option when data transmission is urgent, it is inefficient in a larger and denser mesh network due to the collisions of broadcast data packets. In this paper, we introduce ACE: a Routing Algorithm based on Autonomous Channel Scheduling for Bluetooth Mesh Network. ACE relies on the existing Bluetooth Mesh messages to distribute routes without additional traffic overhead and conducts a beacon-aware routing update adaptively as the topology evolves. In ACE, BLE channel resources can be efficiently utilized by a channel scheduling scheme for each node locally and autonomously without any neighborly negotiation. We implement ACE on the nRF52840 from Nordic Semiconductor and evaluate its effectiveness on our testbed. Compared to the Bluetooth Mesh, our experiments proved that ACE could reduce the end-to-end latency by 16%, alleviate packets collisions issues, and increase the packet delivery ratio (PDR) by 30% under heavy traffic. Moreover, simulation results verified that ACE has better scalability when the size and density of networks become larger and denser.

Although the basic techniques for direction estimation have been known and used for a long lime in different application scenarios (e.g., RADAR), the complexity of Phase-Difference-of-Arrival transceivers discouraged its use for indoor applications. This scenario changed with the recent development of modern chips at competitive prices. Specifically, two ubiquitous technologies in the context of indoor positioning, namely Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-Wideband (UWB), currently feature Angle-of-Arrival estimation. In this paper we compare these two technologies regarding their potential for indoor positioning based on a fair evaluation of their performance for estimating Angle-of-Arrival in five different realistic setups. The results obtained are compared with existing studies when available. Our results show that Ultra-Wideband is, in general, more accurate and precise, especially when subject to multipath interference. Additionally, we discuss possible approaches to improve the accuracy and precision of Angle-of-Arrival estimation using BLE, such as the impact of increasing the number of antenna elements. By using UWB, we achieved an angular accuracy of up to 5 degrees even under obstructed LOS and multipath, while an overall mean error of nearly 25 degrees was obtained with BLE in an outdoor scenario without obstacles.

Such approach is particularly important for the Art, for providing information on exhibitions, art galleries and museums, and to allow the access to the cultural heritage patrimony to people with disabilities. The system may provide also very important information and input to elderly people, helping them to perceive more deeply the reality and the beauty of art. The system is based on Beacons, very small and low power consumption devices, and Human Body Communication protocols. The Beacons, Bluetooth Low Energy devices, allow to obtain a position information related to predetermined reference points, and through proximity algorithms, locate a person or an object of interest. The position obtained has an error that depends from the interferences present in the area. The union of Beacons with Human Body Communication, a recent wireless technology that exploits the human body as a transmission channel, makes it possible to increase the accuracy of localization. The basic idea is to exploit the localization derived from Beacons to start a search for an electrical signal transmitted by the human body and to distinguish the position according to the information contained in the signal. The signal is transmitted by capacitance to the human body and revealed by a special resonant circuit (antenna) adapted to the microphone input of the mobile device.

Pattern-of-Life Modeling in Smart Homes	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Cyber-physical systems; security and privacy; smart environment; test-bed and trials		Smart home devices are relatively inexpensive, readily available, and easily integrated into homes. However, retailers provide smart home devices with little scrutiny in regards to device security or known vulnerabilities. This paper presents a smart home architecture designed with commercially available devices used to investigate Internet of Things data leakage in the wild. Additionally, a pattern-of-life analysis tool was developed to exhibit how an eavesdropper can use traffic from a smart home to classify devices, identify events, track users, and gain physical access to a home. The tool was evaluated through five-days of experimentation in which 17 of 18 devices were classified, 95% of 343 events were identified, and users were tracked with near 100% accuracy. This information, combined with a discovered Bluetooth low energy lock vulnerability, were used to gain unfettered access to the home while the user was away. Furthermore, a mitigation technique was created to introduce spoofed wireless traffic sent on behalf of devices within the home to hinder an eavesdropper's ability to classify devices, identify events, and track users. During an additional five-day experiment, security devices were concealed, 221 false events were introduced per day, and the user appeared always home. Finally, this paper provides security recommendations to manufacturers and users to help defend against vulnerabilities and create a safer smart home environment.

In its full operation stage (2018/01-2020/04),aBeacon consists of customized BLE devices at 12,109 merchants, interacting with 109,378 couriers to infer their status to assist the scheduling of 64 million delivery orders for 7.3 million customers with a total amount of $600 million order values. Although in an academic setting, using BLE devices to detect arrival and departure looks straightforward, it is non-trivial to design, build, deploy, and operateaBeacon from its conception to its retirement at city scale in a metric-based approach by considering the tradeoffs between various practical factors (e.g., cost and performance) during long-term system evolution. We report our study in two phases, i.e., an 8-month pilot study and a 28-month deployment and operation in the wild. We focus on an in-depth reporting on the five lessons learned and provide their implications in other systems with long-term operation and broad geospatial coverage, e.g., Edge Computing.

Recently, wearable and flexible sensors have been employed to analyze sweat, glucose, blood, and human skin conditions. However, a flexible sensing system that allows for the real-time monitoring of throat-related illnesses, such as salivary parotid gland swelling caused by flu and mumps, is necessary. Here, for the first time, a wearable, highly flexible, and stretchable piezoresistive sensing patch based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is reported, which can record muscle expansion or relaxation in real-time, and thus act as a next-generation POC sensor. The patch offers an excellent gauge factor for in-plane stretching and spatial expansion with low hysteresis. The actual extent of muscle expansion is calculated and the gauge factor for applications entailing volumetric deformations is redefined. Additionally, a bluetooth-low-energy system that tracks muscle activity in real-time and transmits the output signals wirelessly to a smartphone app is utilized. Numerical calculations verify that the low stress and strain lead to excellent mechanical reliability and repeatability. Finally, a dummy muscle is inflated using a pneumatic-based actuator to demonstrate the application of the affixed wearable next-generation POC sensor.

One of the great tourism potential is the museum. In displaying the artifacts and their information the museum manager has difficulty in recognizing the behavior of museum visitors such as the route chosen in seeing the artifacts presented, how long they have been at a location, what artifacts are of their interest, etc. This is quite difficult to do, especially with the many artifacts that exist in a museum. This research created an activity tracker system for museum visitors using the Indoor Positioning System by utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Signals from BLE beacons detected by museum visitors' smartphones are used as a reference to estimate the location of visitors using the trilateration method and the Kalman filter. This location data is then stored in a server to be information of the movement of visitors in the museum. Based on this information, museum managers can find out which locations are often / rarely visited by visitors and how long visitors spend at that particular location. According to the distance error testing that compare real location and calculation position, it shows that the average error distance is around 114.35 cm. So, it can he concluded that the information obtained is sufficient to represent the position of the museum visitors	[Handojo, Andreas; Anggita, Jonathan Kurnia] Petra Christian Univ, Informat Dept, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Lim, Resmana] Petra Christian Univ, Elect Engn Dept, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Octavia, Tanti] Petra Christian Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Surabaya, Indonesia	Universitas Kristen Petra; Universitas Kristen Petra; Universitas Kristen Petra	Handojo, A (corresponding author), Petra Christian Univ, Informat Dept, Surabaya, Indonesia.	handojo@petra.ac.id; resmana@petra.ac.id; tanti@petra.ac.id; jonathandot13@gmail.com	Octavia, Tanti/AAD-5360-2021	Handojo, Andreas/0000-0003-0365-2496; Octavia, Tanti/0000-0003-0075-2993	Indonesia Directorate Research and Technology of Higher Education [002/SP2H/P/K7/KM/2019]; Petra Christian University Mobile Computing Research Group	Indonesia Directorate Research and Technology of Higher Education; Petra Christian University Mobile Computing Research Group	This research supported by Indonesia Directorate Research and Technology of Higher Education under grant 002/SP2H/P/K7/KM/2019.

While the majority of existing solutions suggest a wireless key to be a battery-powered device with considerable computational power, we propose to use passive NFC tags instead. In our approach, all the computations are performed by the service the user is authenticating to and thus no computational power and no battery on the key side is required. This approach allows minimizing the device size and significantly reducing the costs. To ensure security of data stored on the tag we propose a transparent data encryption mechanism constructed on top of strong cryptographic primitives. In addition to the authentication-related feature, we have designed a system that enables secure storage of documents on the same tag making it capable of saving ID cards, bank cards, licenses, etc. The presented approach allows on-the-fly validation of any stored document by the entity that issued it as well as by any other entity granted such permissions. Correctness and a security level of the system have been assessed via the analytical study and validated through a hardware prototype.

Although HBC offers less than 10pJ/bit energy efficiencies, it strictly demands both the transmitter and receiver to be on the body. Traditional MedRadio enables data transfer even when either devices are not on the body, but consumes orders of magnitude more energy than HBC, primarily due to large power consumption in LO generation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate a COntext-aware, Reconfigurable transmitter (COR-Tx) consisting sub-3pJ/bit HBC and sub-5pJ/bit MedRadio modes (both state-of-the-art), while supporting opportunistic switching between the two modes depending on the location of the receiver (on-body/off-body) for achieving optimum system-level energy with seamless communication. For 10 Mbps data rate, the HBC mode achieves an energy efficiency of 2.24pJ/bit, while the MedRadio mode achieves 4.93pJ/bit using a shared LO generation scheme that utilizes direct-modulated edge combination (EC) for minimizing energy consumption. The energy-efficiency improvement over the state-of-the-art is similar to 2.1X for HBC and similar to 90X for MedRadio.

Currently used low-power protocols such as Zigbee and Bluetooth Low Energy have limited communication range, whereas long-range communication strategies used in cellular and satellite networks are heavy on energy consumption. Methods that use narrow-band communication such as LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT have low spectral efficiency, leading to scalability issues. The goal of this work is to develop a communication framework that can satisfy the following requirements: (1) Increased battery life, (2) Longer communication range, (3) Scalability in a wireless network. In this work, we propose, design, and prototype WiChronos, a communication paradigm that encodes information in the time interval between two narrowband symbols in order to drastically reduce the energy consumption in a wide area network with a large number of senders. We leverage the low data-rate and relaxed latency requirements of such applications to achieve the desired features identified above. Based on our prototype using off-the-shelf components, WiChronos achieves an impressive 60% improvement in battery life compared to state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies at distances of over 800 meters. We also show that more than 1000 WiChronos senders can co-exist with less than 5% probability of collisions under low traffic conditions.

Based on past research, optimized localization method for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to predict position of person or object with high accuracy has not been found yet. Most recent research that have solve Received Signal Strength (RSS) inconsistent value is using fingerprint method. This paper proposed a deep regression machine learning using convolutional neural network (CNN) with regression-based fingerprint model to estimate real position. The model used 5 nearest fingerprints as reference RSS values with their location (x or y) label as inputs to produce output of single value position (x or y), then repeat the process to produce second value of position to create complete coordinate of estimated position. To evaluate the proposed model, a comparison between training data with validation data using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used. The comparisons are with Multilayer Perceptron model and with the weighted sum method as benchmark. The experiment Gave results of mean distance and 90th percentile distance between proposed model with the benchmark. CNN model achieved accuracies of lower than 330cm at 90th percentile with mean distance lower than 185cm. Weighted sum model achieved accuracies lower than 360cm at 90th percentile with mean distance higher than 185cm, and MLP is in between them. The result demonstrates that the proposed method outperformed the benchmark methods.

It makes use of new lightweight protocols that allow sensors to self-describe, auto-calibrate, and auto-register. Such protocols enable the development of novel IoT solutions while guaranteeing low latency, low power consumption, and the required Quality of Service (QoS). Thanks to the developed human-centered tools, it is possible to configure and modify dynamically IoT device firmware, managing the active transducers and their communication protocols in an easy and intuitive way, without requiring any prior programming knowledge. In order to evaluate the performance of the system, it was tested when using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ethernet-based smart sensors in different scenarios. Specifically, user experience was quantified empirically (i.e., how fast the system shows collected data to a user was measured). The obtained results show that the proposed VTED architecture is very fast, with some smart sensors (located in Europe) able to self-register and self-configure in a remote cloud (in South America) in less than 3 s and to display data to remote users in less than 2 s.

The minimization of latencies in a connection between Bluetooth-enabled terminals is the most important research issue with Bluetooth MANETs. In order to counter the issue, we have proposed a combination method between Classic Bluetooth (Classic) and connection-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). However, the latency of the combination method is still large and has limited applicability to Bluetooth MANETs in real world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new fast connection establishment method for Bluetooth MANETs to minimize the latency by utilizing both BLE-broadcast and Classic. In addition, since the procedure of connection establishment between terminals is performed in an autonomous distributed manner, the statuses of terminals can become deadlocked. To tackle this problem, we also propose and employ a new arbitration method by using uniquely assigned IDs for each terminal. We have implemented and evaluated our proposed method as applications for smartphones with Android OS. As a result, we can confirm that our proposed method has a reduced latency. In addition, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can achieve a 3-second latency in a configuration with deadlocks. Furthermore, we have confirmed that our proposed method can be frequently applied to larger-scaled networks.

Oftentimes, when subscribers experience frustratingly high network delays and timeouts, they like to know whether their experiences are shared by other users nearby. The question that is often asked is essentially this: "is it just me, or do others around me face the same problem?" In this paper, we describe how we use Tattle, a distributed real-time participatory sensing and monitoring framework, to glean network performance information from users nearby. Tattle relies on recent advances in peer-to-peer device networking, such as WiFi Direct, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Apple's iBeacon, to exchange key snippets of diagnostic information using very low-power, very short-range local-area wireless interfaces, between participating devices. We propose and develop a robust statistical algorithm, based on quantile regression, which identifies key points in time where a device experiences high delays and outages that are not observed by its neighbors, and decides if the device is performing "normally", or "abnormally". This directly answers the "me, or others?" question. We demonstrate and validate the efficacy of our system through real-world measurements of network delay, consisting of over 7,300 time-series that comprises over 443,500 data samples, using commodity smart devices attached to two different providers' networks.

This is especially true for "robotized" large industrial machines as heavy and bulky objects that are unintentionally dropped by the machine can lead to substantial damages and pose a significant safety risk. Consequently, adding a proximity and tactile sensing to such large industrial machinery can help to mitigate this problem. In this paper, we present a sensing system for proximity/tactile sensing in gripper claws of a forestry crane. In order to avoid difficulties with respect to the installation of cables (in particular in retrofitting of existing machinery), the sensors are truly wireless and can be powered using energy harvesting, leading to autarkic, i.e., self-contained, sensors. The sensing elements are connected to a measurement system which transmits the measurement data to the crane automation computer via Bluetooth low energy (BLE) compliant to IEEE 1451.0 (TEDs) specification for eased logical system integration. We demonstrate that the sensor system can be fully integrated in the grasper and that it can withstand the challenging environmental conditions. We present experimental evaluation of detection in various grasping scenarios such as grasping at an angle, corner grasping, improper closure of the gripper and proper grasp for logs of three different sizes. Results indicate the ability to detect and differentiate between good and poor grasping configurations.

We developed an air quality monitoring platform that comprises a wearable device embedding low-cost metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors, a PM sensor, and a smartphone for collecting the data using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. Our own developed app displays information about the air surrounding the user and sends the gathered geolocalized data to a cloud, where the users can map the air quality levels measured in the network. The resulting device is small-sized, light-weighted, compact, and belt-worn, with a user-friendly interface and a low cost. The data collected by the sensor array are validated in two experimental setups, first in laboratory-controlled conditions and then against referential pollutant concentrations measured by standard instruments in an outdoor environment. The performance of our air quality platform was tested in a field testing campaign in Barcelona with six moving devices acting as wireless sensor nodes.

Different from the outdoor environment, the indoor environment contains different types of obstacles, and different obstacles have different absorption rates of transmitted signals, so the implementation of indoor positioning system becomes more difficult. Indoor positioning technologies include frequency identification (RFID), WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), infrared, 5G cellular, image recognition, ultrasonic, ultra-wideband (UWB) and so on. This study analyzes and compares the advantages, disadvantages and research status of several mainstream single technology positioning, and concluded that the positioning of single technology inevitably has limitations. According to the positioning accuracy, the positioning technology is divided into two categories for comparison. The best technology is selected respectively, and the complementary technology fusion scheme is proposed to solve the shortcomings of single technology. In this paper, the UWB subsystem and BLE angle of arrival (AOA) direction finding subsystem are integrated and positioned, and the algorithms of each subsystem are optimized. The method of distance measurement and direction finding is combined to realize high-precision positioning with one UWB base station and one BLE base station. Finally, a fusion positioning system based on BLE-AOA and UWB is built. After experimental analysis, the positioning accuracy of the system can reach sub-meter level.

As the number of tourists is rapidly increasing, so too are tourist safety concerns. The increasing frequency of natural disasters along with the growth of urban areas makes it even more complex to address the resilience of tourists during such events. This article proposes a framework for collecting information about tourist locations and flows within urban areas and how to use this information for more efficient and safe evacuation routing. We define population behavior models that can be obtained from gathering empirical data and categorize them into three groups. We review the different evacuation scenarios (divided into sudden and predictable scenarios) and the types of information needed in each case. Further, we discuss the complexity of monitoring and forecasting tourists' movements in the long term and for short-term predictions including the available data sources for doing so. The data gathering and tourist behavior are explained with examples from Kyoto, Japan, a major tourist attraction and a location that is prone to disasters. Finally, technological solutions for better guidance during the evacuation process of the population are discussed, including low-tech ones and advanced options such as websites, apps and Bluetooth Low Energy sensors, where the last one is demonstrated by a navigation experiment in a 3D environment.

In the absence of a definitive and an official vaccine for the infection, practicing social distancing has proved to be an effective norm to prevent the risk of infection. In this paper, we present 'ProxiTrak', a smartphone based solution for an enterprise scenario capable of not only tracing the chain of possible infection transmission among a set of population, but also guiding the users towards following social distancing norms by alerting them in real-time about any possible violation of proximity norms on their smartphones. We devise an effective classification model to make proximity decisions on the smartphone itself using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data of on-board Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module using multiple mobile devices in different environments, with novel addition of using temporal features from BLE data to boost the model's accuracy. We briefly discuss ProxiTrak's corresponding server-side framework for tracing a possible chain of infection and analysing social connectivities graphically. We also propose on-device decision aggregation and server-side pruning of proximity events to lower the false positive events. Our model is capable of making strong proximity decisions to an accuracy of up to 94% on the devices trained with the model.

Wireless local area networks (WLANs), such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi, have the advantages of a high bandwidth and transmission speed. However, they have drawbacks, such as their limited transmission distances and the high likelihood of interference from other floors. Therefore, the applicability of wireless teleoperated control in complex factory environments is limited when a WLAN is used. The objective of the present study was to develop a portable long range (LoRa)-based teleoperation controller (PLTC) to solve this problem. LoRa is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology, which is a suitable approach to communication for PLTCs owing to its physical characteristics of long distance and low frequency. Accordingly, we designed an intuitive teleoperation controller with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor and processed the attitude signal using a complementary filter to operate a robotic arm stably. The IMU is an effective and generally applicable sensor for measuring the attitude of devices. Finally, we integrated a LoRa module and a robotic arm to realize long-distance teleoperation control in a harsh factory environment. The results of this study provide a useful reference for controller development and sensor applications for Industry 4.0.

The driver's stress is estimated by the use of physiological signals and steering wheel motion analysis. The steering wheel motion is analyzed by driver's hand moving characteristic. Principally, the sensors on the glove gathered the photoplethysmogram signal via fingertip, and hand motion signal via inertial motion unit. The sensor module readings are transmitted to an end terminal application via a Bluetooth low energy transmission module to compute the driver stress index. The studies are carried out in a simulated driving, which is composed of three distinct driving scenarios to study the subjects' behaviors that correlate with stress. Twenty-eight subjects are requested to perform three different driving sessions with random scenarios generated while performing various driving maneuvers to assess the dynamic of mental workloads. The stress assessments of driving test subjects are self-reported at pre- and post-stimulus as well as observed through facial expression recorded throughout the whole experiments. Moreover, this paper also aimed to investigate the correlation of stress events with different driving tasks. Stress index is computed by a support vector machine pattern classifier with extracted features from sensors reading. Notably, stress index differences were found among three driving scenarios and driving maneuvers. Results revealed the true accuracy of stress detection is greater than 95% in average.

In its full operation stage (2018/01-2020/04), a Beacon consists of customized BLE devices at 12,109 merchants, interacting with 109,378 couriers to infer their status to assist the scheduling of 64 million delivery orders for 7.3 million customers with a total amount of $600 million USD order values. Although in an academic setting, using BLE devices to detect arrival and departure looks straightforward, it is non-trivial to design, build, deploy, and operate aBeacon from its conception to its retirement at city scale in a metricbased approach by considering the tradeoffs between various practical factors (e.g., cost and performance) during a longterm system evolution. We report our study in two phases, i.e., an 8-month iterative pilot study and a 28-month deployment and operation in the wild. We focus on an in-depth reporting on the five lessons learned and provide their implications in other systems with long-term operation and large geospatial coverage, e.g., Edge Computing.

An entire industry-proximity marketing-evolved to capture value from beacon-enabled micro-location networks, with venture capitalists, startups, mobile operating systems suppliers, and major platforms all making substantial investments of data, labor, and resources in the technology. Despite these investments, beacons fell out of favor abruptly, with observers dismissing the technology as an overly cumbersome solution in search of a problem, a "low-value fad." We offer a microhistorical account of beacons' small yet untenable role in the ecologies of location-based commercial surveillance-from the standards wars between Apple and Google to the efforts of startups and tech giants to capitalize on the market's enthusiasm for beacons, and finally, to the industry's quiet collapse. Our analysis builds upon work on the relationship between platform and infrastructure. We argue that proximity marketers failed to construct a viable platform-infrastructure hybrid capable of monetizing beacon proximity data and identify three axes along which beacons frustrated marketers' ambitions for the technology: scalability, exclusivity, and visibility. We conclude by revisiting the platform-infrastructure relationship to discuss beacons' legacy in two surveillance systems: student tracking on college campuses and contact-tracing initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Securing the Internet of Things With Default-Off Networking	2018 IEEE/ACM THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERNET-OF-THINGS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION (IOTDI 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation (IoTDI)	APR 17-20, 2018	Orlando, FL	Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, ACM SIGBED		Internet of Things; Network security		The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we interact with everyday objects. "Smart" devices will reduce energy use, keep our homes safe, and improve our health. However, as recent attacks have shown, these devices also create tremendous security vulnerabilities in our computing networks. Securing all of these devices is a daunting task. In this paper, we argue that IoT device communications should be default-off and desired network communications must be explicitly enabled. Unlike traditional networked applications or devices like a web browser or PC, IoT applications and devices serve narrowly defined purposes and do not require access to all services in the network. Our proposal, Bark, a policy language and runtime for specifying and enforcing minimal access permissions in IoT networks, exploits this fact. Bark phrases access control policies in terms of natural questions (who, what, where, when, and how) and transforms them into transparently enforceable rules for IoT application protocols. Bark can express detailed rules such as "Let the lights see the luminosity of the bedroom sensor at any time" and "Let a device at my front door, if I approve it, unlock my smart lock for 30 seconds" in a way that is presentable and explainable to users. We implement Bark for Wi-Fi/IP and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks and evaluate its efficacy on several example applications and attacks.

The proposed system can be used for a broad base of Internet of Things (IoT) related applications that involve mobility and localization. In our approach, we first compare the indoor positioning accuracy of fingerprinting schemes using WiFi and BLE through their Received Signal Strength (RSS) values. In this comparison, we use these two technologies both separately and in combination, and show that the combined fingerprints of WiFi/BLE sensors give better results than individual fingerprints. We then fuse the combined fingerprinting results of WiFi/BLE sensors with the PDR using two methods: (i) segment-based fusion and (ii) the Kalman Filter (KF). In this experiment, we show that the fusion of WiFi, BLE and PDR using the KF gives 23% improvement in average error over WiFi/PDR fusion and 25% improvement in average error over BLE/PDR fusion while all these different techniques are superior than simple PDR-based localization. We, therefore, conclude that WiFi/BLE/PDR fusion is a promising approach to be considered for future IPSs being designed for personalized IoT-based smart systems.

Sensor deployments often tend towards low-power communication protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE 802.15.4. Gateways are essential to connect these devices to the Internet at large. Over time though, gateways have gained additional responsibilities as well. Sensors expect gateways to handle device-specific data translation and local processing while also providing services, such as time synchronization, to the low-power device. As a centralized computing resource, the gateway is also an obvious location for running local applications which interact with sensor data and control nearby actuators. Today, vendors and researchers often create their own device-specific gateways to handle these responsibilities. We propose a generic gateway platform capable of supporting the needs of many devices. In our architecture, devices provide a pointer, such as a URL, to descriptions of their interfaces. The gateway can download the interface descriptions and use them to determine how to interact with the device, translating its data to a usable format and enabling local services to communicate with it. The translated data is provided to services including user applications, local logging, device status monitoring, and cloud applications. By simultaneously supporting communication with many sensors, our gateway architecture can simplify future sensor network deployments and enable intelligent building applications.

The topic is important to create a robust sensorized environment to be applied in industrial context or smart infrastructure to enable scheduled monitoring with low power consumption applications. Currently BLE applications are mainly thought for smart home solutions, health care and positioning systems. In those applications the BLE nodes are continuously supplied by external power suppliers. Our goal is to design a self-configuring network with a synchronized deep sleep behavior, aimed to optimize the energy consumption, with an overall active time interval constraint optimized with a data-driven method. The aim is to find a tradeoff between the on time and the ability to collect all the nodes data, pursuing a low power consumption. Our research is based on BLE protocols, interaction between edge systems for data collection and cloud system for data analysis and software agent optimization system. The paper analyses different configurations and describes the possible optimization algorithm to be used for the software agent design, in order to reach a fine-tuned control to improve the fault tolerance and fault diagnosis of the system. Finally experimental results are compared with the estimates obtained via a software simulation tool implemented for this architectural pattern. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.	[Rosati, C.

This article introduces a robust design of the transient-motion-powered motion detector, which is called ViPSN-pluck. "ViPSN" is the acronym for the vibration-powered sensing node while "pluck" stands for the plucking-motion energy harvester. By using a piezo-magneto-elastic structure, ViPSN-pluck can efficiently harvest energy from a transient motion. By properly making good use of this tiny harvested energy, ViPSN-pluck can effectively carry out motion detection and Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) wireless communication. Given the concurrency of mechanical potential energy precharging and motion detection, the transient-motion plucking energy harvester used in ViPSN-pluck has the merit of high energy reliability. This unique feature is unprecedented in the solar and radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting cases, which might suffer from energy outages under fluctuating irradiance or RF signal strength, respectively. The working principle of ViPSN-pluck, in particular, the dynamic characteristics of the plucking energy harvester and the energy matching between generation and utilization, are discussed in detail to demonstrate the robustness in operation. The cyber-electromechanical synergy among the mechanical dynamics, power conditioning circuit, and low-power embedded system is highlighted. The design methodology of ViPSN-pluck provides a valuable reference for the developments of future motion-powered Internet of Things devices.

The smart UHPC, which has the self-sensing ability, comprises steel fibers, fine steel slag aggregates (FSSAs), and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as functional fillers. The proposed wireless sensing system used a low-cost microcontroller unit (MCU) and two-probe resistance sensing circuit to capture change in electrical resistance of self-sensing UHPC due to external stress. For wireless transmission, the developed wireless sensing system used Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon for low-power and multi-channel data transmission. For experimental validation of the proposed smart UHPC, two types of specimens for tensile and compression tests were fabricated. In the laboratory test, using a universal testing machine, the change in electrical resistivity was measured and compared with a reference DC resistance meter. The proposed wireless sensing system showed decreased electrical resistance under compressive and tensile load. The fractional change in resistivity (FCR) was monitored at 39.2% under the maximum compressive stress and 12.35% per crack under the maximum compressive stress tension. The electrical resistance changes in both compression and tension showed similar behavior, measured by a DC meter and validated the developed integration of wireless sensing system and smart UHPC.

To date, there is no system that comprehends all the requirements for clinical applications, in terms of performance and design. In this paper, a compact measurement system is proposed for monitoring HME performance in vivo, comparing the results with in vitro testing outcomes. The portable system presented is connected to the ventilation circuit close to the HME and assures wide compatibility with the new generation of smart devices because of its embedded Bluetooth low-energy module. Low power consumption ensures long-term monitoring capability of more than 24h. Laboratory tests performed both in static and dynamic conditions showed rise- and fall-times for humidity measurements between 1s and 1.8 s, compatible with many common variations in working operative conditions during mechanical ventilation. Clinical tests performed in the ICU demonstrated the possibility to effectively and continuously monitor in vivo HME performance. Furthermore, the comparison of the in vivo performances with the in vitro standard procedure and the agreement of the parameter ranges monitored allowed us to confirm the reliability of the system, highlighting the usefulness of this approach for proper real time HME monitoring.

The proposed stethoscope can be used in hospitals and telemedicine through an internet of things (IoT) system and a cloud database. The proposed stethoscope includes three parts, namely, a front-end device for ECG and heart sound measurement, a smart device application (APP), and a cloud server. The ECG-measuring device is designed for single lead measurement and has low power consumption and IoT-based design, which can send real-time ECG data to the smart device APP. Simultaneously, the heart-sound-measuring device combined with a traditional stethoscope head is used to measure heart sound signals. This device includes an analog front-end circuit and a microphone to filter environmental noises and to record heart sound signals. Heart sound signals are transmitted to the APP by using a Bluetooth Low Energy module. The smart device APP can display synchronized and real-time signals, including ECG and heart sounds. Meanwhile, those signals are recorded in smart devices and are uploaded to the cloud server, where doctors and users can diagnose and monitor healthcare anytime.

The long-term and self-sustainable operation of these wireless sensors is a key factor when designing networks using them. To prolong the lifetime of these sensors, various approaches that are capable of harvesting the required energy from various sources have been proposed over the last few years. Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH) technology is one of them which shows promise in terms of availability, ease of implementation, and cost. We investigate the current status of WEH technology for IoT-enabled sensors. In particular, we evaluate the energy characteristics and operation of two types of environmental wireless sensors (one based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication and the other on the UDP protocol) that are powered by a wireless energy harvesting element and operate in the IoT environment Our literature review on WEH for IoT revealed that despite significant advances that have been made in the design and development of wireless power harvesting elements, achieving self-sustainable wireless sensors for IoT remains a significant challenge. Finally, we also highlight some research challenges of WEH for IoT that need to be addressed in the future.

The emergence of technologies such as Zigbee, Bluetooth low energy, and embedded sensors has transformed simple physical devices into smart objects that can understand and react to their environment. Such smart objects form the building blocks for the Internet of Things. Although the need for security is widely accepted, there is no clear consensus on how IP-based Internet security protocols can be applied to resource-constrained smart object networks. In this paper, we develop a new secure and energy-efficient communication model for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a light-weight communication protocol designed for smart object networks. This architecture and the communication model ensures data integrity and authenticity over a multi-hop network topology. It provides a mirroring mechanism that uses a proxy to serve data on behalf of sleeping smart objects, thereby allowing them to act as always-online web servers. A working prototype implementation of the architecture is also developed. The security features in the architecture presented in this paper are based on using strong public-key cryptography. Contrary to popular belief, our performance evaluation shows that asymmetric public-key cryptography can be implemented on small 8-bit microcontrollers without modifying the underlying cryptographic algorithms using public libraries.				mohit@kth.se; jari.arkko@ericsson.com; ari.keranen@ericsson.com	Sethi, Mohit/F-4654-2019	Sethi, Mohit/0000-0002-9730-1955					40	1	1	0	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4673-2130-3; 978-1-4673-2128-0				2012							973	981						9	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science	BEY20					2023-06-19	WOS:000318619100044

In this paper we present the first private end-to-end encryption protocol called the Eddystone-Ephemeral-ID (Eddystone-EID) protocol. This protocol enables connectivity from any beacon to its remote owner, while supporting beacon's privacy and security, and essentially preserving the beacon's low power consumption. We describe the Eddystone-EID development goals, discuss the design decisions, show the cryptographic solution, and analyse its privacy, security, and performance. Finally, we present three secure IoT applications built on Eddystone-EID, demonstrating its utility as a security and privacy infrastructure in the IoT domain. Further, Eddystone-EID is a prototypical example of security design for an asymmetric system in which on one side there are small power-deficient elements (the beacons) and on the other side there is a powerful computing engine (a cloud). The crux of the design strategy is based on: (1) transferring work from the beacon to the cloud, and then (2) building a trade-off between cloud online work against cloud offline work, in order to enable fast real-time reaction of the cloud. These two principles seem to be generic and can be used for other problems in the IoT domain.

The Role of Bedroom Privacy in Social Interaction among Elderly Residents in Nursing Homes: An Exploratory Case Study of Hong Kong	SENSORS			English	Article						privacy; social interaction; elderly residents; nursing home; indoor location tracking	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MULTIPLE-OCCUPANCY; OLDER-PEOPLE; CARE; DEMENTIA; HEALTH; ENVIRONMENTS; ARCHITECTURE; INSTRUMENT; OUTCOMES	Privacy is often overlooked in Hong Kong nursing homes with the majority of elderly residents living in shared bedrooms of three to five people. Only a few studies have used Bluetooth low energy indoor positioning systems to explore the relationship between privacy and social interaction among elderly residents. The study investigates the social behavioural patterns of elderly residents living in three-bed, four-bed, and five-bed rooms in a nursing home. Location data of 50 residents were used for the identification of mobility and social interaction patterns in relation to different degrees of privacy and tested for statistical significance. Privacy is found to have a weak negative correlation with mobility patterns and social behaviour, implying that the more privacy there is, the less mobility and more formal interaction is found. Residents who had more privacy did not spend more time in social space. Residents living in bedrooms that opened directly onto social space had higher social withdrawal tendencies, indicating the importance of transitional spaces between private and public areas. Friends' rooms were used extensively by residents who had little privacy, however, the concept of friends' rooms have rarely been discussed in nursing homes. There is evidence supporting the importance of privacy for social interaction. Future study directions include considering how other design factors, such as configuration and social space diversity, work with privacy to influence social interaction.	[Yang, Aria C.

As components that can be implemented at low cost, BLE beacons have been used in several systems developed in previous research. In this work, we focus on the Kanban system, which is a measure used in manufacturing strategy. The Kanban system emphasizes inventory management and is used to produce only required amounts. In the Kanban system, the Kanban cards are rotated through the factory along with the products, and when the products change to a different process route, the Kanban card is removed from the products and the products are assigned to another Kanban. For this reason, a single Kanban cannot trace products from plan to completion. In this work, we propose a system that uses a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon to connect Kanbans in different routes but assigned to the same products. The proposed method estimates the beacon status of whether the Kanban is inside or outside a postbox, which can then be computed by a micro controller at low computational cost. In addition, the system connects the Kanbans using the beacons as paired connection targets. In an experiment, we confirmed that the system connected 70% of the beacons accurately. We also confirmed that the system could connect the Kanbans at a small implementation cost.

An outstanding problem in this area is the availability of effective application-layer protocols between service seekers and providers at the Internet of Things (IoT) level because most IoT nodes run on batteries. Hence, IoT-Fog discovery service must be energy efficient to prolong the lifetime of smart objects. This paper presents a thorough study of our previously proposed MQTT-driven IoT-fog integration, namely the Power Efficient Node Discovery (PEND), and investigates the impact of dynamic arrival patterns on its performance. The MQTT broker serves as a fog node to trigger turning on/off the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interfaces of the surrounding objects by monitoring their trajectories. Furthermore it leverages this additional location awareness to significantly reduce the power consumption of the device discovery process for mobile devices. With this motivation, we present a detailed performance study of PEND under various settings and provide in-depth discussions of some lessons about the obtainable energy saving and the effectiveness of the our enhanced BLE device discovery solution. The results we present are valuable for the fog community to design new optimizations and to refine the whole IoT device discovery process to the purpose of better efficiency and scalability.

To evaluate the performance of a flexible solar panel under skin, ex-vivo experiments are conducted under natural sunlight and artificial light sources. The results show that the solar panel covered by a 3 mm thick porcine flap can output tens of microWatts to a few milliwatts depending on the light conditions. The subcutaneous solar energy harvester is tested on different body parts, which suggests the optimal position for the harvester to implant is between neck and shoulder. A wireless implantable system powered by the subcutaneous energy harvester is presented, which consists of a power management circuit, a temperature sensor, and a Bluetooth low energy module. An application is developed for data visualization on mobile devices, which can be a gateway for future IoT-based healthcare applications. The entire device is embedded in a transparent silicone housing (38 mm x 32 mm x 4 mm), including a 7 mAh rechargeable battery for energy storage. The average power consumption of the implants is about 30 mu W in a 10 min operation cycle. With the subcutaneous solar energy harvester, the self-powered operation of the implantable sensor prototype is demonstrated by long-term experimental results. Two worst-case scenarios (no exposure to light and battery depletion) are considered with ex-vivo experiment simulations.

This antenna offers dual band operation. The prototype follows a configuration constituting a driven element (radiator) and a parasitic element. The first band offers a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) bandwidth (3:1) of 183 MHz (0.85-1.04 GHz). The VSWR bandwidth (3:1) for the second band is 2.77 GHz (2-4.77 GHz). It also offers a 3 dB AR bandwidth of 1.1 GHz (2.1-3.2 GHz). The 2:1 VSWR bandwidth of 0.9 GHz (2.1-3 GHz) and cross-polarisation in the second band makes this antenna suitable for 2.4 GHz RFID reader applications. The other services supported by the proposed antenna include global system for mobile communication (0.88-0.96 GHz), long-term evolution (2.3-2.4 GHz), wireless fidelity (2.4-2.5 GHz), bluetooth low energy (2.4 GHz) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (3.5 GHz). To extract the multiservice characteristics, it is necessary to integrate this antenna to a handheld computing platform. For assessing the performance in such a platform, the prototype is optimised and merged with a larger ground plane of size 170 mm x 130 mm and studied in the course of this study.

The RO is reused as the delay cell of TDC, and the quantization step of TDC is always tracked with the RO period; hence no calibration is needed in this architecture. We adopt RO tuning to lower the injection-locking bandwidth so as to decrease the power consumption of the injection current. Moreover, the fractional part of phase error detection is turned down in the coarse tuning of ADPLL to save power. An LC-based digital-controlled oscillator (LCDCO) with a 6.4 nH inductor and a resistive bias is used to have a low power and better phase noise performance. The ADPLL is fabricated in 40 nm CMOS with a 1 V supply and consumes 1.4 mW when it is locked. The measured phase noise is -114 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The test results show significant power saving. Thus, it can be a promising candidate for BLE applications.

Due to its low cost and high popularity, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has been used to detect proximity based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). To address the fact that RSSI can be markedly influenced by device carriage states, previous works have incorporated RSSI with inertial measurement unit (IMU) using deep learning. However, they have not sufficiently accounted for the impact of multipath. Furthermore, due to the special setup, the IMU data collected in the training process may be biased, which hampers the system's robustness and generalizability. This issue has not been studied before. We propose PRID, an IMU-assisted BLE proximity detection approach robust against RSSI fluctuation and IMU data bias. PRID histogramizes RSSI to extract multipath features and uses carriage state regularization to mitigate overfitting due to IMU data bias. We further propose PRID-lite based on a binarized neural network to substantially cut memory requirements for resource-constrained devices. We have conducted extensive experiments under different multipath environments, data bias levels, and a crowdsourced dataset. Our results show that PRID significantly reduces false detection cases compared with the existing arts (by over 50%). PRID-lite further reduces over 90% PRID model size and extends 60% battery life, with a minor compromise in accuracy (7%).

Dynamic threshold adjustment in a proximity-based location tracking system using reference modules	2015 INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC)	International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IEEE IWCMC)	AUG 24-25, 2015	Dubrovnik, CROATIA	IEEE, IEEE Croatia Sect, Univ Dubrovnik		Bluetooth; Bluetooth Low Energy; Correlation; Correlation Coefficient; Dynamic; Kalman Filter; Location; Location Tracking; Path Loss Exponent; Proximity; Received Signal Strength; Reference Module; RSSI; Signal Strength Fluctuation; Threshold; Tracking		In recent years, location tracking systems have become important in areas such as transportation, shopping, logistics and medicine. One of the most recent approaches are proximity-based location tracking systems, which use the received signal strength (RSSI) measured between a sender and an anchor module. The advantages of these systems are high scalability, minimal calibration effort and low costs. However, there are also disadvantages e.g. the fluctuating signal strength under certain circumstances in the environment. To detect, if an object has entered a predefined region, the RSSI must exceed a specified threshold. When the current signal fluctuates due to obstacles (other objects, people, etc.) the static threshold does not apply for the defined region any longer. In this case automatic adjustments of the threshold are made with the help of a reference module. Various factors are measured between reference, anchor as well as a sender module and subsequently used to correct the static threshold. The dynamic adjustment was tested through three experiments and showed satisfactory results concerning the hypotheses. For further research, additional factors might need to be included to make the proposed method more dynamic and responsive to the environment.

A centralized solution relying on collecting and storing user traces and location information on a central server can provide more accurate and timely actions than a decentralized solution in combating viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19. However, centralized solutions are more prone to privacy breaches and privacy attacks by malevolent third parties than decentralized solutions, storing the information in a distributed manner among wireless networks. Thus, it is of timely relevance to identify and summarize the existing privacy-preserving solutions, focusing on decentralized methods, and analyzing them in the context of mobile device-based localization and tracking, contact tracing, and proximity detection. Wearables and other mobile Internet of Things devices are of particular interest in our study, as not only privacy, but also energy-efficiency, targets are becoming more and more critical to the end-users. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of user location-tracking, proximity-detection, and digital contact-tracing solutions in the literature from the past two decades, analyses their advantages and drawbacks concerning centralized and decentralized solutions, and presents the authors' thoughts on future research directions in this timely research field.

Framework for Simultaneous Indoor Localization, Mapping, and Human Activity Recognition in Ambient Assisted Living Scenarios	SENSORS			English	Article						simultaneous location and mapping; ambient assisted living; human activity recognition	TRACKING	Indoor localization and human activity recognition are two important sources of information to provide context-based assistance. This information is relevant in ambient assisted living (AAL) scenarios, where older adults usually need supervision and assistance in their daily activities. However, indoor localization and human activity recognition have been mostly considered isolated problems. This work presents and evaluates a framework that takes advantage of the relationship between location and activity to simultaneously perform indoor localization, mapping, and human activity recognition. The proposed framework provides a non-intrusive configuration, which fuses data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed in the person's shoe, with proximity and human activity-related data from Bluetooth low energy beacons (BLE) deployed in the indoor environment. A variant of the simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) framework was used to fuse the location and human activity recognition (HAR) data. HAR was performed using data streaming algorithms. The framework was evaluated in a pilot study, using data from 22 people, 11 young people, and 11 older adults (people aged 65 years or older). As a result, seven activities of daily living were recognized with an F1 score of 88%, and the in-door location error was 0.98 +/- 0.36 m for the young and 1.02 +/- 0.24 m for the older adults. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the groups, indicating that our proposed method works adequately in broad age ranges.

These internet-on-chip devices support different protocols (Bluetooth, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, sub-GHz links), from about 300 MHz to 6 GHz, with max. sustained bit-rates from 250 kb/s (sub-GHz links) to 4 Mb/s (Wi-Fi), and different trade-offs between RX sensitivity (from -74 to -100 dBm), RX noise figure (few dB to 10 dB), maximum TX power (from 0 to 22 dBm), link distances, power consumption levels (from few mW to several hundreds of mW). One limit for their successful application is the missing of an easy-to-use modeling and simulation environment to plan their deployment. The need is to predict, before installing a network, at which distances the sensors can be deployed, the real achievable bit-rate, communication latency, outage probability, power consumption, battery duration. To this aim, this paper presents the H(2)AWKS (Harsh environment and Hardware Aware Wireless linK Simulator) simulator, which allows the planning of a WSAN taking into account environment constraints and hardware parameters. Applications of H2AWKS to real WSAN case studies prove that it is an easy to use simulation environment, which allows design exploration of the system performance of a WSAN as a function of the operating environment and of the hardware parameters of the used devices.

However, an accurate and versatile positioning system is yet to emerge. In this article, we present an indoor positioning device based on 2-D infrared laser beams and a novel positioning algorithm. The device can be mounted on an object being tracked as a tag and uses the infrared laser beams emitted by two lighthouse base stations to calculate its location. It captures the laser beams using an infrared photodiode, digitizes the captured signals using a light to digital converter, and carries out positioning calculations in a low-power microcontroller on board the device. The position coordinates are then transferred to a smartphone via a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transceiver once every second. The device is powered by a 3.7-V LiPo battery and can operate for a period of 15 h using a 300-mAh battery. The enclosed device is cylindrical and has a height of 7 mm and a diameter of 23 mm, thus making it easily mountable on the object being tracked. The experimental results show that the device has an absolute total accuracy of 127 mm when the lighthouse base stations are placed 10 m apart. This device can be effectively used in single-room positioning of objects in various applications, including tracking goods in storerooms, equipment in hospitals, robot navigation, and in research on the movement of small animals.

In addition, the growing of elderly population [2] implies an increase in medical costs, as they are the age group that requires the highest use of public health services. The detection of changes in the elderly people routines can be an indicator of the onset of physical or cognitive impairment. The early detection of that decline can alert to implement measures to alleviate the deterioration, and as a consequence, this can lead to both improve independent living and reduce health care costs. This work is focused on the analysis of routines of elderly people living in care homes. They are quite routine people since the ordinary activities they perform are supervised by carers. Currently, several volunteers are being monitored to obtain their symbolic location based on BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology [3], and through this location the objective is to derive their routines. BLE beacons have been installed in each room of interest within the nursing home, and volunteers wear a smartwatch that stores the MAC (Media Access Control) address and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) of each beacon it receives. However, due to the lack of data at this stage of the project, we proceed to generate synthetic routines based on real data and carers information, to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

The antenna can be applied in a smart belt system to set up a communication link with other electronic devices and/or host a variety of sensors to track human motions. The proposed belt antenna works at 2.45 GHz in the industrial, scientific, and medical radio band for Bluetooth low energy communications. Considering the effect the human body would have on the performance of a belt antenna, a textile ground plane is designed to be integrated into the trouser fabric behind the belt to provide isolation from the body and simultaneously improve antenna radiation characteristics. Through the application of the ground plane, the belt antenna achieves a maximum realized gain of 7.94 dBi and a minimum specific absorption rate of 0.04 W/kg at 0.5 W input power. During the design process, characteristic mode analysis is used to explore the underlining principle and further optimize the antenna performance. Two typical EBG structures are analyzed in detail for this application scenario. The suspended transmission line method is used to evaluate EBG performance variations when the textile ground plane is bent. A prototype of such a system is fabricated and tested. Experimental results shows that the belt antenna, together with the textile EBG ground plane, is an excellent candidate for a smart belt system with desirable radiation pattern, efficiency, and safety limit.

The DCO core is designed to operate in the subthreshold region. The DCO power consumption is reduced mainly by maintaining the constant current over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations in the oscillator core via an adjustable low-dropout (LDO) regulator. The power consumption is also reduced by employing gm/ID optimization methodology and by lowering the supply voltage. A very small capacitance of about Delta C approximate to 16 aF through a customized lateral metal-oxide-metal capacitor bank is utilized to attain small switchable capacitance in the fine capacitor bank tuning. The parasitic inductance due to routing is eliminated by using an aluminum metal with a very large width. The proposed design is fabricated with 55-nm CMOS process. The experimental results show that the power consumption of the proposed DCO including both LDO and bandgap voltage reference is 260 mu W with the supply voltage of 0.55 V, and the constant current consumption is 480 mu A over PVT variations. The tuning range of 2.23 similar to 2.7 GHz and frequency resolution of 2.44 kHz are achieved. At 1-MHz offset frequency from the carrier frequency of 2.44 GHz, the DCO phase noise and the figure of merit (FOMT) considering the frequency tuning range are -119.05 and 199.12 dBc/Hz, respectively.

At the same time, and with the contribution of climate change effects, dangerous weather events have become more common on road infrastructure. In this context, Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions emerge to overcome the limitations of human and local sensory systems, through the collection and distribution of relevant data to Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an intra- and inter-vehicle sensory data collection system is presented, starting with the acquisition of relevant data present on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, collected through the vehicle's On-Board-Diagnostics II (OBD-II) port, as well as on an on-board smartphone device and possibly other additional sensors. Short-range communication technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi, and ITS-G5, are employed in conjunction with long-range cellular networks for data dissemination and remote cloud monitoring. The results of the experimental tests allow the analysis of the road environment, as well as the notification in near real-time of adverse road conditions to drivers. The developed data collection system reveals itself as a potentially valuable tool for improving road safety and to iterate on the current Road Weather Models (RWMs).

While formal methods have been applied to Bluetooth security, existing efforts either focus on one configuration of a protocol or one protocol of the suite, without considering other configurations or interactions among protocols. As a result, manual analysis still dominates the state-of-the-art security research of Bluetooth specification. To enable automatic Bluetooth security analysiswith formal guarantees, we propose a comprehensive formalmodel for Bluetooth protocol suite covering both the key sharing phase and the data transmission phase, in all the three Bluetooth protocols, and detecting their design flaws automatically. Our formal model, written in ProVerif, adopts a modular design by abstracting each step within a protocol into an interface and implementing different methods in each step as modules to instantiate the interface, throughwhich all possible configurations of a protocol could be examined. We further abstract different Bluetooth protocols into modules enabling the modeling of their interactions and relax the threat model to allow reasoning about semi-compromised devices. We use this model to formally verify 418 security properties and find 82 violationswith attack examples capturing 5 known vulnerabilities and discovering 2 new security issues. Bluetooth SIGconfirmed our independent discovery of these 2 newissues, with one issue assigned a CVE and the other issue acknowledged in a security notice. Our model provides one step towards formally verified Bluetooth security.

Fingerprinting is the most used technique because of its higher accuracy. However, this technique requires a labor-intensive training phase that measures the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) at all Reference Points (RPs) locations. On the other hand, model-based IPSs use signal propagation models to estimate distances from RSSI. Thus, they do not require expensive training but result in higher positioning errors. In this work, we propose SynTra-IPS (Synthetic Training Indoor Positioning System), a hybrid approach between a fingerprint and a model-based IPS that uses synthetic, simulated datasets combined with data fusion techniques to eliminate the fingerprint collection cost. In our solution, we use the map of the scenario, with known anchor nodes' positions and the log-distance signal propagation model, to generate several synthetic, model-based, fingerprint training datasets. In the online phase of our solution, the positions estimated by the several synthetic datasets using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are combined using data fusion techniques into a single, more accurate position. We evaluated the performance of our SynTra solution in a real-world, large-scale environment using mobile devices with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, and we compared our solution to classic approaches from the literature. Our results show that SynTra can locate mobile devices with an average error of only 2.36 m while requiring no real-world environment training.

It is designed to work inside a culture chamber performing impedance measurement in the frequency range of 64Hz to 200KHz. The board is equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module allowing it to be wirelessly controlled. The software interface (also called ISMI) is coded with all required functionalities to manage the parameters of the board such as start frequency and sweep, measuring intervals, data acquisition and visualization and also a function to perform automatic measuring between desired time intervals during whole day for many days. In addition, the electrodes used for the measurements of cells are characterized giving an impedance magnitude between 103 to 105 ohms in a frequency range of 300Hz to 100KHz and a maximum voltage without considerable electrode deterioration of 120mVpeak. This information is used in the calibration of the ISMI system giving a measurement accuracy above 98% when compared with simulation results and with a reference instrument. The proposed system is an introductory step in the study of cells related to fibrous tissue induced by implants showing to be a viable and reproducibility-improving approach for such analysis. This first prototype provides information regarding the requirements for the design of an integrated version for embedded applications.

However, navigating around public transportation for the visually impaired and physically challenged sections of society is a challenging task. With rapid proliferation of technology, there has been a pressing need to develop enhanced methodologies to help people with disabilities access public transportation. While there are many navigation systems, some of them leverage Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which is useful in outdoor environments but is not effective in navigating indoor environments. Beacons are emergent sensors that are becoming popular for indoor positioning in malls and airports. They use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, which is extensively supported by all modern day smartphones. In this paper, we propose a proof of concept (POC) for a mobile application which uses BLE beacons to provide assistance to people with special needs. This application would provide an easy to use voice interface for navigating inside stations, buses and trains. As a part of our research, we aim to use existing beacons on some regional transit centers and deploy new beacons. We plan to analyze VTA's (Valley Transportation Authority) ridership data to extract contextual data about the commuter's current environment inorder to provide commuter's with a cognitive solution and assistance during travel. The end goal of our research is to enhance the VTA travel experience for special need travelers in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The solution has been implemented by first proposing the MLAELD (Machine Learning Architecture for Excavators' Location Detection), in which Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been used for tracking the live locations of excavators preceded by collecting the data of the signal strength mapping from multiple beacons at each specific point in a closed area. Second, machine learning techniques are proposed to develop and train multioutput regression models using linear regression, K-nearest neighbor regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. These techniques can predict the live locations of the required persons and machines with a high level of precision from the last beacon strengths received.

Based on the PPG and ECG signals, the pulse rate and heart rate could be extracted respectively. Moreover, the pulse transmit time (PTT) could be extracted combining PPG and ECG, which was the key to calculate blood pressure (BP). The circumstance conditions (temperature, humidity and barometric pressure) were detected and displayed on the screen. A motion state was used to toggle the watch screen. Meanwhile all data measured could be sent to an android smart phone, using a Texas Instruments' (TI's) Bluetooth low energy chip CC2540. The PPG wave, ECG wave, heart rate, as well as the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) can be displayed on the android client in real time. Compared with the sport band and other smart watches, this multi-parameter health monitoring watch had the advantage of monitoring more parameters. We had made a test to compare this watch with standard equipment, Benavidez T5 and SUNTECH OSAR2, and the result showed that the relative error of heart rate, pulse rate, SBP and DBP against reference were 1.76 +/- 1.64 bpm, 1.76 +/- 1.64 bpm, 4.01 +/- 2.75 mmHg, 4.64 +/- 3.31 mmHg. These results demonstrated that this watch has a broad prospect in the field of mobile health care.

The commonly used indoor location detection methods are Wi-Fi positioning, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and Pedestrian Dead-reckoning (PDR). PDR can provide location information relative to the original position by analyzing acceleration and angular velocity using sensors in smartphones without needing any positioning equipment in the environment. Meanwhile, to know the user's context in the indoor environment, PDR, RFID and surveillance cameras are investigated. Although PDR results can provide the atomic physical behavior such as the direction of walking (forward/backward or right/left), it is difficult to detect the user's shopping behaviors to determine if he/she is approaching, searching or just browsing in the shopping venues. Our research objective is to estimate the user's walking context appropriate for shopping venues with the same sensor information as used for conventional PDR. We propose a new method for walking context recognition that uses machine learning with a feature vector of accelerometers and gyroscopes. Based on the experiments conducted, we found that this model was able to recognize the intuitive walking context. We also established the utility of our proposal in the experiment at the actual shopping venue and verified that it can be applied to improve PDR positioning precision by 8%.

Therefore, MEMS positioning has long-time error accumulation. The fingerprint positioning of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is independent of accumulative error, but there is an irregular jump error in the positioning result, which limits the positioning accuracy. Furthermore, the actual commercial positioning systems generally require the consecutive positioning in multi-floor environment. Based on this, this paper proposes a data fusion algorithm based on BLE and MEMS for indoor cross-floor positioning. Firstly, we denoise the fingerprint database by clustering, outlier detection, and filtering algorithms. Then, the extended Kalman filter is employed to complete the optimal estimation of the twodimensional target position according to the robust M estimation. Finally, the barometer and geographical position information are used to achieve the height estimation of the target. This paper also carries out a large number of engineering verification. The experimental results show that the algorithm can suppress the cumulative error effectively caused by low-cost MEMS sensors, and solve the problem of irregular jump error caused by Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) jitter. In the indoor multi-layer environment, the proposed system achieves the horizontal and vertical positioning Root Mean Square (RMS) errors less than 0.9 m and 0.35 m respectively. In addition, we have verified the stability of the designed system through the long-time test.

The penetration of tracking devices with sensory such as GPS devices, accelerators and specifically smart phones has impacted human lives extensively. Nowadays, many applications on smart phones and mobile devices exploit different techniques and inputs for positioning. Wireless positioning is generally divided into two categories: outdoor positioning and indoor positioning, depending on not only where they are used but also how they work. Powerful as it is, indoor positing is still a challenging problem because satellite-based approaches do not work properly inside buildings. Therefore, for indoor positioning, we need to use other technologies creatively. iBeacon, the focus of this paper, is a new technology which provides a higher level of location awareness in indoor positioning. iBeacon is a built-in, cross-platform technology for Android and iOS devices, which utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for long-last services. This technology has significant advantages compared to other types of indoor positioning technologies, such as less expensive hardware, less energy consumption, needless to internet connection, and being capable of receiving notifications in background. This technology will provide huge benefits for future location awareness applications. It will change the way retailers, event organizers, and educational institutions communicate with people indoors. In this paper, we aim to provide a more accurate, cost efficient approach to indoor positioning of mobile devices using iBeacon.

In these applications, the positions of iBeacons are assumed to be known. However, the location information is often unavailable or inaccurate as most iBeacons were deployed by different external parties. In addition, manual localizing the already-deployed iBeacons is costly and even impractical, especially in large-scale and complex indoor environments. Therefore, we propose a novel method, namely SomeBe, which can localize deployed iBeacons with a minimal effort and invasiveness to existing infrastructures. Specifically, our approach uses cooperative multilateration based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) of available smartphones and WiFi access points (APs) in the environment. Both Bluetooth signal strengths (between smartphones and iBeacons) and WiFi signal strengths (between smartphones and APs) are jointly employed in a single optimization cost function to surpass the local minima. Requiring that the positions of the APs are known only, the proposed cost function can also localize the iBeacons without knowing the positions of smartphones. To improve the localization accuracy, we employ a clustering method based on the RSS values for the coarse estimation of iBeacons' positions. SomBe also can be used to simplify iBeacon deployment as it can localize the iBeacons with a minimal effort. The performance evaluation results of our testbed experiments as well as realistic simulations show that SomBe outperforms non-cooperative approaches with 85% better in terms of accuracy.

HIRO-NET is an emergency infrastructure-less network that aims to address the problem of providing connectivity in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, where no cellular or wide area network is operational and no Internet access is available. HIRO-NET establishes a two-tier wireless mesh network where the Lower Tier connects nearby survivors in a self-organized mesh via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the Upper Tier creates long-range VHF links between autonomous robots exploring the disaster-stricken area. HIRO-NET's main goal is to enable users in the disaster area to exchange text messages to share critical information and request help from first responders. The mesh network discovery problem is analyzed and a network protocol specifically designed to facilitate the exploration process is presented. We show how HIRO-NET robots successfully discover, bridge and interconnect local mesh networks. Results show that the Lower Tier always reaches network convergence and the Upper Tier can virtually extend HIRO-NET functionalities to the range of a small metropolitan area. In the event of an Internet connection still being available to some user, HIRO-NET is able to opportunistically share and provide access to low data-rate services (e.g., Twitter, Gmail) to the whole network. Results suggest that a temporary emergency network to cover a metropolitan area can be created in tens of minutes.

However, the constraints of processing, memory and power consumption are very high in these nodes. Cryptographic algorithms based on symmetric key are very suitable for them. The drawback is that secure storage of secret keys is required. In this work, a low-cost solution is presented to obfuscate secret keys with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), which exploit the hardware identity of the node. In addition, a lightweight fingerprint recognition solution is proposed, which can be implemented in low-cost sensor nodes. Since biometric data of individuals are sensitive, they are also obfuscated with PUFs. Both solutions allow authenticating the origin of the sensed data with a proposed dual-factor authentication protocol. One factor is the unique physical identity of the trusted sensor node that measures them. The other factor is the physical presence of the legitimate individual in charge of authorizing their transmission. Experimental results are included to prove how the proposed PUF-based solution can be implemented with the SRAMs of commercial Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chips which belong to the communication module of the sensor node. Implementation results show how the proposed fingerprint recognition based on the novel texture-based feature named QFingerMap16 (QFM) can be implemented fully inside a low-cost sensor node. Robustness, security and privacy issues at the proposed sensor nodes are discussed and analyzed with experimental results from PUFs and fingerprints taken from public and standard databases.

In order to decrease the die area, only two inductors were used in this work. Besides the one used in the voltage control oscillator (VCO), the PA load inductor was reused as the RX impedance matching component in the front-end. Proper controls have been applied to achieve high transmitter (TX) input impedance when the transceiver is in the receiving mode, and vice versa. This allows the TRX-switch/matching network integration without significant performance degradation. The RX adopted a low-IF structure and integrated a single-ended low noise amplifier (LNA), a current bleeding mixer, a 4th complex filter and a delta-sigma continuous time (CT) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The TX employed a two-point PLL-based architecture with a non-linear PA. The RX achieved a sensitivity of 93 dBm and consumes 9.7 mW, while the TX achieved a 2.97% error vector magnitude (EVM) with 9.4 mW at 0 dBm output power.

The preferred method of tethering these devices to the Internet is through the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communication protocol connecting them to special-purpose mobile applications. The efficient development of high-quality applications of this type can present challenges to developers who have to familiarize themselves with a number of new technologies and platform-specific architectural patterns. A combination of domain-specific languages and code-generation techniques is a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we present (a) a generic reference architecture for Android BLE-enables applications, and (b) our AHL (Android Health Language), a domain-specific language and a corresponding co-degeneration framework that enables the easy and rapid development of the core elements of a typical BLE-enabled data-collection application in this architecture. The generated code is functional and does not need any modifications. This model-driven application-construction process relieves developers from the burden of dealing with complex Android concepts and components. Thus, AHL can save time and reduce the cost of Android application development for developers. In this paper, we explain the AHL framework, its models, its underlying DSL, and the methodology we used to design and implement it. We evaluate our work with two functional applications and compare them to the existing ones developed from scratch.

Applying Seamful Design in Location-Based Mobile Museum Applications	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Design; Human Factors; Experimentation; Human-computer interaction; museum studies; game design; smart-phone games; mobile games; location based gaming; seamful design; multimodal interaction; mobile	TECHNOLOGY	The application of mobile computing is currently altering patterns of our behavior to a greater degree than perhaps any other invention. In combination with the introduction of power-efficient wireless communication technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), designers are today increasingly empowered to shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build entirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to facilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a number of potential problems. Most notably, the position and orientation of the user in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of people traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the received BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning of any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving seamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate the use of a seamful approach, that is, to reveal and exploit these problems and turn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the viability of this approach, we designed, implemented, and evaluated the Ghost Detector-an educational location-based museum game for children. By presenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design decisions, this article provides insight into some of the challenges and possible solutions connected to the process of developing location-based BLE-enabled experiences for public cultural spaces.

When the plant owner reduces the number of workers due to operation costs, it will be standard for a single worker to visit the site. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the location of workers in real-time to detect unexpected human accidents quickly. Conventional methods use radio waves, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but there is little demand for communication equipment in the incineration plant. However, there is not enough demand for communication facilities in the incineration plant. It is too large to bear the cost of installing wireless access points, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons just for positioning. Therefore, we are focusing on magnetism using for indoor positioning method. In addition, the incineration plant has a lot of types of equipment that contains a wide range of magnetized metals, large motors, and generators. We could observe the magnetic peculiarity at each point. Based on these assumptions, we have developed a new indoor positioning method at the incineration plant. This paper describes the development of an indoor positioning system for an incineration plant. And we propose three methods for fingerprinting matching: Point matching, Path matching, and DTW matching. The average positioning errors of these methods are 6.89 m, 0.05 m, and 0.06 m, respectively.

These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via 'HTTP requests' for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001% which proves its applicability in healthcare.

Using the knowledge of the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) physiology, assessment and training methods are developed to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary incontinence. Therefore, this paper covers the design and implementation of a portable vaginal dynamometer. Methods: A PFM probe is designed, 3D printed, assembled, and tested in ten women to assess its acceptability and usability. The feedback from the usability study is used to optimize the PFM probe design. A vaginal dynamometer is developed based on the designed PFM probe, then tested for linearity, repeatability, hysteresis, noise and heat effect, and power consumption. The variability between the different produced PFM probe prototypes is evaluated. Results: Force measurements are made using a load cell. Wireless communication is performed through a Bluetooth low energy transceiver v5.0, with a corresponding interface on both computer and smartphone. The device operates at a 3.3V supply and achieves a power consumption of 49.5 mW in operating mode. Two PFM probe sizes are designed to accommodate different vaginal hiatus sizes, based on usability study feedback. The proposed system allows the physiotherapist to wirelessly monitor variation in pelvic floor muscle force during assessment and/or training. Discussion/Conclusion: The testing results showed that the newly designed system has the potential to measure the PFM function in functional conditions such as the standing position.

The positioning fixing subsystems often provide poor quality measurements with gaps in an urban environment. No single position fixing technology works continuously. Many sensor fusion variations have been previously trialed to overcome this challenge, including the particle filter that is robust and the Kalman filter which is fast. However, a lack exists, of context aware, seamless systems that are able to use the most fit sensors and methods in the correct context. A novel adaptive and modular tripartite navigation filter design is presented to enable seamless navigation. It consists of a sensor subsystem, a context inference and a navigation filter blocks. A foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning systems were used in the evaluation implementation of this design. A novel recursive 2-means clustering method was developed to track multiple hypotheses when there are gaps in position fixes. The closest hypothesis to a new position fix is selected when the gap ends. Moreover, when the position fix quality measure is not reliable, a fusion approach using a Tukey-style particle filter measurement update is introduced. Results show the successful operation of the design implementation. The Tukey update improves accuracy by 5% and together with the clustering method the system robustness is enhanced.

The system transmits a wide-band ultrasonic signal into a room and then processes the superposition of the reflections recorded by a microphone. The system has two modes of operation, one for presence detection and one for estimating the number of occupants in a region. The presence detection uses the difference between multiple transmissions in succession with a set of general classifiers that make a binary decision about if the room contains occupants. We then use a semi-supervised learning approach based on Weighted Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) that requires minimal training data to estimate the number of occupants. We also present the design of an energy harvesting embedded platform and demonstrate that our algorithm can continuously execute using energy harvested from indoor solar panels. The platform has a dual Bluetooth Low-Energy and 802.15.4 interface to communicate with a gateway or nearby mobile phone that runs an interface that aids in collecting training data. We evaluate our algorithm on a wide-variety of indoor spaces as well as benchmark the hardware in terms of sampling rate given an energy budget.

Indeed, many products have been released that aim to find lost objects using the received signal strength indication (RSSI). However, these products do not provide sufficiently accurate location information to find objects. In this paper, we propose an active RFID attached object clustering method based on RSSI series for finding lost objects. This approach to find lost objects does not execute existing localization methods. We hypothesize that users can deduce the location of a lost object from information about surrounding objects in an environment where RFID tags are attached to all personal belongings. To help find lost objects from the proximity between RFID tags, the system calculates the proximity between a pair of RFID tags from the RSSI series, and estimates the groups of objects in the neighborhood. We present a method for calculating the proximity of the lost object to those around it using a distance function between RSSI series and estimating the group by hierarchical clustering. We confirm the validity of the proposed method, and determine the most appropriate pairs of four distance functions and four clustering algorithms. From the experimental results, it is apparent that our method provides a clear advantage in finding lost objects at low financial and installation cost, and can estimate groups accurately even if the smartphone or RSSI sensor is moving quickly.

Although many solutions currently exist, the acceptance of most of them is extremely poor due to their technical limitations and the complete lack of taking into consideration factors, such as usability and the perceived experience among others, which influence adoption rates. To alleviate this problem, we created BlindMuseumTourer, a state-of-the-art indoor navigation smartphone application that tracks and navigates the user inside the spaces of a museum. At the same time, it provides services for narration and description of the exhibits. The proposed system consists of an Android application that leverages the sensors found on smartphones and utilizes a novel pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) mechanism that optionally takes input from the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons specially mounted on the exhibits. This article presents the extended Usability and User Experience evaluation of BlindMuseumTourer and the findings carried out with 30 participants having varying degrees of blindness. Throughout this process, we received feedback for improving both the available functionality and the specialized user-centred training sessions in which blind users are first exposed to our application's functionality. The methodology of this evaluation employs standardized questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, and the results indicate an overall positive attitude from the users. In the future, we intend to extend the number and type of indoor spaces supported by our application.

We report an integrated capsule sensing system, utilizing a hybrid packaging scheme coupled with triglyceride film-coated capacitive sensors, for measuring biochemical species present in the duodenum, such as pancreatic lipase and bile acids. The system uses microfabricated capacitive sensors interfaced with a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-microcontroller, allowing wireless connectivity to a mobile app. The triglyceride films insulate the sensor surface and react either with 0.01-1 mM lipase via hydrolysis or 0.07-7% w/v bile acids via emulsification in simulated fluids, leading to measurable changes in capacitance. Cross reactivity of the triglyceride films is evaluated in both phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as well as pancreatic trypsin solutions. The film morphology is observed after exposure to each stimulus to better understand how these changes alter the sensor capacitance. The capsule utilizes a 3D-printed package coated with polymers that remain intact in acid solution (mimicking gastric conditions), then dissolve at a duodenum-mimicking neutral pH for triggered opening of the sensing chamber from which we can subsequently detect the presence of pancreatic lipase. This device strategy represents a significant step towards using embedded packaging and triglyceride-based materials to target specific regions of the GI tract and sensing biochemical contents for evaluating gastrointestinal health.

Given a floor plan, inertial and signature-based systems can converge on accurate locations by slowly pruning away inconsistent states as a user walks through the space. In contrast, range-based systems are capable of instantly acquiring locations, but they rely on densely deployed beacons and suffer from inaccurate range measurements given non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. In order to get the best of both worlds, we present an approach that systematically exploits the geometry information derived from building floor plans to directly improve location acquisition in range-based systems. Our solving approach can disambiguate multiple feasible locations taking into account a mix of LOS and NLOS hypotheses to accurately localize with significantly fewer beacons. We demonstrate our geometry-aware solving approach using a new ultrasonic beacon platform that is able to perform direct time-of-flight ranges on commodity smartphones. The platform uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for time synchronization and ultrasound for measuring propagation distance. We evaluate our system's accuracy with multiple deployments in a university campus and show that our approach shifts the 80% accuracy point from 4-8m to 1m as compared to solvers that do not use the floor plan information. We are able to detect and remove NLOS signals with 91.5% accuracy.

The approach is dedicated to Bluetooth Low Energy devices and broadcast transmission. The main goal of the approach is to obtain a suitable level of security and trust with reasonable energy (resources) usage and minimal cost of crypto-graphic functions. In the case direct interaction with an IoT device is not possible, all the traditional approaches for the verification of trust fail. Moreover, due to the limited resources of a typical IoT device (memory, CPU, battery life), implementation of traditional verification mechanisms is not feasible. In our approach, the IoT devices are detected and inspected by a dedicated application (executed in a smartphone) prepared by a trusted third party (usually city administrator). The system acts as a base for a trusted, generic information system of the city area. The implementation of trust is based on a modified shared-secret algorithm and an exchange of some parameters at the installation phase for each device. Later on, each device is operating autonomously and offline, transmitting the information only in broadcast mode. The application, while detecting a signal from a device, is able to assess the level of trust towards the device and the information received. The solution assumes backward compatibility with devices and applications which do not require verification of the trust.

Nevertheless, the evolution of such interfaces is currently hampered by the unavailability of embedded platforms capable of delivering the required computational power at high energy efficiency and allowing for a small and unobtrusive form factor. To fill this gap, we developed BioWolf, a highly wearable (40mm 20 mm 2 mm) BCI platform based on Mr. Wolf, a parallel ultra low power system-on-chip featuring nine RISC-V cores with DSP-oriented instruction set extensions. BioWolf also integrates a commercial 8-channel medical-grade analog-to-digital converter, and an ARM-Cortex M4 microcontroller unit (MCU) with bluetooth low-energy connectivity. To demonstrate the capabilities of the system, we implemented and tested a BCI featuring canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of steady-state visual evoked potentials. The system achieves an average information transfer rate of 1.46 b/s (aligned with the state-of-the-art of bench-top systems). Thanks to the reduced power envelope of the digital computational platform, which consumes less than the analog front-end, the total power budget is just 6.31mW, providing up to 38h operation (65mAh battery). To our knowledge, our design is the first to explore the significant energy boost of a parallel MCU with respect to single-core MCUs for CCA-based BCI.

AWDL is a proprietary extension of the IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard and integrates with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for providing services such as Apple AirDrop. We conduct the first security and privacy analysis of AWDL and its integration with BLE. We uncover several security and privacy vulnerabilities ranging from design flaws to implementation bugs leading to a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack enabling stealthy modification of files transmitted via AirDrop, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks preventing communication, privacy leaks that enable user identification and long-term tracking undermining MAC address randomization, and DoS attacks enabling targeted or simultaneous crashing of all neighboring devices. The flaws span across AirDrop's BLE discovery mechanism, AWDL synchronization, UI design, and Wi-Fi driver implementation. Our analysis is based on a combination of reverse engineering of protocols and code supported by analyzing patents. We provide proof-of-concept implementations and demonstrate that the attacks can be mounted using a low-cost ($20) micro:bit device and an off-the-shelf Wi-Fi card. We propose practical and effective countermeasures. While Apple was able to issue a fix for a DoS attack vulnerability after our responsible disclosure, the other security and privacy vulnerabilities require the redesign of some of their services.

Most Dead-Reckoning (DR) systems nowadays available are based on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) operating at a relatively high sampling frequency of more than 100 Hz in order to track the typical human motion with a sufficient resolution. In this work, a method is proposed which allows to reduce the sampling frequency for sensor data by a factor of more than 10. The inaccuracies and fluctuations associated with the low sampling rate are compensated by applying a correction algorithm that takes the geometry of the underlying environment as well as the previous motion direction into account. A similar concept for sampling rate reduction and post-processing will also be applied to the data of an air pressure sensor. This sensor type can be used for movement detection in vertical direction. The adjustment of the sampling frequency is done adaptively based on the movement of the person subject to track. It will be shown that by using the proposed methods the accuracy of position tracking is comparable to that of an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) operating at 200 Hz whereas the data rate and therewith the power consumption is reduced by a factor of more than 10. This is verified by measurements using an experimental setup based on low-cost. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules.

J	Chernyshev, M; Valli, C; Johnstone, M				Chernyshev, Maxim; Valli, Craig; Johnstone, Michael			Revisiting Urban War Nibbling: Mobile Passive Discovery of Classic Bluetooth Devices Using Ubertooth One	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Bluetooth; Ubertooth; passive discovery; surveillance; forensics		The ubiquitous nature of Bluetooth technology presents opportunities for intelligence gathering based on historical and real-time device presence data. This information can be of value to law enforcement agencies, intelligence organizations, and industry. Despite the introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy standard that incorporates anonymity preservation mechanisms, the presence of devices that support Classic Bluetooth that uses unique and persistent device identifiers is expected to remain significant for a number of years. The common approach to finding discoverable Classic Bluetooth devices relies on a standard inquiry process that is not truly passive. Furthermore, this approach fails to detect devices that remain undiscoverable. Ubertooth One, a low-cost open source Bluetooth development platform, can assist with overcoming this limitation in a truly passive manner, making it an attractive digital forensic instrument. Using vehicle-based sensors and parallel multi-method device discovery, we conduct a practical evaluation of Ubertooth One for passive discovery and contrast its discovery rate to the standard method. Based on 83 comparative field experiments, we show that Ubertooth One can produce forensically sound observations while able to discover up to ten times as many devices. We also show that this method can identify repeat device presence, as we observe 2370 instances of repeat observations on different days in single and multiple location scenarios. We conclude that this passive technique can complement the standard method and has the potential be used as a viable alternative.

There are some problems with existing methods such as PDR, ultrasound and laser range finder: installation location of measurement equipment at large site, cost for measurement equipment, and necessity of smartphone application. We focus on Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE). Currently, BLE technology is used as proximity notification for smart phones and cannot detect the exact distance between two BLE devices. This is because BLE radiowave is unstable and signal strength changes every time at the same distance. In this paper, we propose a location estimation method which utilizes BLE beacon tags and single board computers. In contrast to conventional ways using location-fixed BLE beacons, BLE beacon tags are distributed to participants at the event. Signal strengths of BLE advertising packets captured by multiple location-fixed scanners are used for location estimation. The method requires less cost for equipment and labor of installing an application. It can be used without complex initial setting. We had a data collection experiment at real large-scale exhibition. We estimate locations of participants by applying the proposed method to the collected data, then evaluate accuracy of estimation and analyse the activities such as the time of longer stay booths based on participants' occupation. As a result, we could track the movement of the participants to some meters error and find the characteristic booths based on longer-stay booths per occupations.

Moreover, most countries had a hard time keeping up with the new mutations of COVID-19. Therefore, taking preventive measures to control the spreading of the virus, including lockdowns, curfews, social distancing, masks, vaccines, is not enough to stop the virus. However, using the new technologies to adapt the preventionmeasures and enhance the existing oneswill be more efficient. Most countries have already developed their non-pharmaceutical interventions measures (NPIs), mainly contacts tracing solutions at the pandemic beginning. Using those mobile applications, the authorities were able to reduce the spreading of the virus. Nevertheless, the virus is evolving, mutating, and becoming more and more dangerous to survive. Therefore, these mobile applications have become less effective in facing the constant changes of the pandemic situation. To that end, the need for enhancing and evolving contact tracing became more urgent. The goal here is to control the spread of the new variants and keep up with the rapid changes happening around the world. In this paper, we will present a detailed view of the new solution built to take contact tracing to a new level, empowered by the Bluetooth Low Energy technology for communication, advanced encryption method for security and data privacy, as well as secured storage and data management to have a system capable of slowing the COVID-19 variants from spreading and save lives.

A Temperature-Compensated BLE Beacon and 802.15.4-to-BLE Translator on a Crystal-Free Mote	2021 51ST EUROPEAN MICROWAVE CONFERENCE (EUMC)	European Microwave Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	51st European Microwave Conference (EuMC)	APR 04-06, 2022	London, ENGLAND	APS, EurAAP		Internet of Things; crystal-free radio; temperature compensation; wireless temperature sensor		Crystal-free radios have the potential to revolutionize the IoT: due to their single-chip nature, they are both very cheap (no external components required) and very small (the size of a grain of rice). The Single-Chip Micro Mote (SC mu M) is a 2x3x0.3 mm(3) crystal-free chip that can communicate with off-the-shelf transceivers over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or IEEE 802.15.4. Setting its communication frequency is challenging because the crystal-free chip can rely only on internal oscillating circuits, which are very susceptible to temperature. Without compensation, a SC mu M chip can no longer communicate with an off-the-shelf BLE receiver if the temperature changes by more than 1.25 degrees C. This paper introduces a two-step temperature compensation method, allowing SC mu M to successfully send BLE frames over a 20 degrees C temperature range. After performing initial calibration during optical bootloading, we use an open-loop linear model to estimate the ambient temperature and continuously tune the mote's local oscillator (LO) frequency as the temperature changes. We show how the mote can use the intermediate frequency of 802.15.4 frames it receives from nearby off-the-shelf transceivers as a frequency reference to adjust its LO frequency. This compensation method enables SC mu M to operate as a tiny BLE beacon, a BLE temperature sensor (for retail or medical applications), or a 802.15.4-to-BLE translation device.

This has led to realizing novel application paradigms such as crowd sensing and crowd computing. Crowd sensing relies on the sensing capabilities of the mobile devices as well as its communication efficiency to send collected sensed data to the cloud for further processing. On the other hand, mobile crowd computing is an amalgamation of the machine and human intelligence to achieve a given set of tasks in a distributed manner. Thus, crowd computing utilizes the computation and communication capability of the devices. Here in our work, we have come up with a novel approach integrating these two paradigms in a framework that have addressed both the issues of mobile sensing and crowd computing at the same time and utilized the ability of the crowd to solve problems without involving cloud servers in the backend. We have implemented our framework using 4 smart handheld devices for a route-finding application. The devices are connected to each other through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology. The results obtained can he received both online (using the machine intelligence) and offline (using human intelligence) when no devices arc connected to the internet. The device hence receiving the information, in turn, can itself he a contributor in the crowd for other route-finding queries solicited by another user in the crowd.

The system employs deep neural network image encoder to encode a given input image and generates an extremely compact representation (as small as 10 bytes) of the image. At the receiver end, another deep neural network decoder runs on a mobile device which decodes (i.e. generates) the original image from the BLE broadcast messages. We evaluate Deep Beacon's performance using hand-written digit images and different types of RGB images that contain objects such as birds, flowers, and traffic signs. We empirically determine the tradeoffs between the system lifetime and the quality of broadcast images, and determine an optimal set of parameters for our system, under user-specified constraints such as the number of available beacon devices, maximum latency, and life expectancy. We develop a smartphone application that takes an image and user-requirements as inputs, shows previews of different quality output images, writes the encoded image into a set of beacons, and reads the broadcasted image back. Our evaluation shows that one beacon device is capable of broadcasting high-quality images (90% structurally similar to original images) for a year-long continuous broadcasting, and both the lifetime and the image quality improve when two beacons are used.

Bluetooth Core Specification v5.2 provides a new Bluetooth audio transmission technology - BLE Audio. BLE Audio provides two transmission modes - connection oriented Connected Isochronous Group (CIG) and broadcast oriented Broadcast Isochronous Group (BIG). In this paper, we design a QoS (Quality of Service) sensitive networking scheme based on BLE Audio (QSNBA). First, a layered architecture based on BLE Audio is proposed. Then, we use defined broadcast packets for information exchange to form the master-slave node cluster. Next, according to time delay, reliability and other parameters, multi-hierarchical fuzzy comprehensive appraisal (MFCA) is used to select the appropriate mode between master and slave nodes in the two transmission modes - BIG and CIG. In addition, we also use a method to evaluate the importance of Bluetooth nodes to revise the transmission mode. Finally, We built BLE Audio node model based on OmNET++ and carry out simulation verification. The results show that average end-to-end delay of QSNBA is reduced by 0.42s and the energy consumption is reduced by 56% compared with the all CIG mode, the packet delivery rate of QSNBA is improved by 10.5% compared with the all BIG mode. Moreover, QSNBA has a superior performance on average end-to-end delay, energy consumption and packet delivery rate when the network has a large number of devices.

We introduce a new perspective to view the indoor positioning problem by radio map fingerprint. We argue that even though beacons may be independently deployed, the RSSI series bear certain spatial relation because of their copresence in the same physical space. The latent relation implicitly conveyed by the coexistence of their signals at various indoor locations. Unlike existing approaches that try to find a direct mapping between sensed signals and the corresponding location, we explore the spatial relation of beacons from the input data to estimate location. We propose a deep learning localization system, termed DRVAT, which is based on the distributed representation vector (DRV) and self-attention (AT) among the pairs of MAC-RSSI. First, we obtain DRVs which represent dense features in low dimensionality through pre-training on all MAC-RSSIs. Then we exploit self-attention mechanism to learn the latent spatial relation of beacons. Finally, MAC-RSSIs labeled with locations are used to fine-tune the model for estimating location. Localization accuracy results demonstrated the superior performance as compared with other positioning methods, and the visualization of DRV and attention mechanism are consistent with the spatial deployment of BLE.

The sols of NiO and ZnO have been synthesized using sol-gel method. The structural, morphological, and optical analysis of the synthesized ZnO and NiO nanoparticles prepared from sol has been done. The spin coating technique was used for the fabrication of HTL, ETL, and perovskite layers. The thickness of the fabricated solar cell is about 2 mu m. The current density versus voltage (JV) characteristics of the fabricated solar cell was investigated. The JV characteristics revealed the value of various parameters such as short-circuit current density (J(SC)), open-circuit voltage (V-OC), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency, and maximum power (P-max) is 15.90 mA/cm(2), 0.93 V, 73%, 10.70%, and 10.70 W, respectively. The fabricated solar cell has been used to design a special electronic circuit with maximum power point tracker (MPPT) for monitoring of patient suffering from the heart diseases. The performance parameters of MPPT circuit have been tested under "direct sunlight" and "artificial shadow."

The use of different technologies in the system to be developed to determine the position with high accuracy is important for overcoming the disadvantage(s) of any technology. To design a high-precision indoor positioning method, it is important create an Internet of things (IoT) environment which uses hybrid technologies. The proposed system has been tested on an IoT environment by using two phases: preproccessing and localization. The corresponding environment is an original IoT environment, which allows to collect a hybrid dataset consists of WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Earth's magnetic field values. HALICDB dataset is created in the related ecosystem. To make a comparison with HALICDB, RFKONDB is used to create RFKON_HIBRID with similar signal values. The signal values obtained from the datasets are first passed through a particle filter. In the localization phase, a reference signal map is obtained for the detection of the moving objects in the indoor areas that are in the IoT environment using the fingerprint method. In the offline phase, the different machine learning methods are used in fingerprint maps for classification. It is seen that the highest accuracy is received through stacked sparse autoencoder from the deep learning methods due to the overcomplete network structure offered by the IoT environment on both datasets.

However, in densely populated areas, the bicycle remains a very useful means of transportation. Its small size and minimal environmental impact are the critical factors that maintain its relevance. Moreover, the advancement of connected devices and sharing-based services have allowed private vendors to develop bike-sharing programs, giving millions access to bike transportation around the globe. These bike-sharing programs rely on the user to check out and return the bike to a designated bike-holding station. With the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) services and wirelessly connected devices, there is a major benefit in enabling vendors to track their bicycle assets. Satellite navigation has come a long way, however, it requires a large power overhead. This paper proposes an energy-efficient bicycle tracking system that utilizes bicycle powered Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and Long Range (LoRa) type base-stations in order to track and maintain a real-time location-based inventory of all assets. The BLE beacons are used to track individual bicycle assets based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) proximity and the LoRa base stations exploit longer range communication capabilities to transmit asset location information between each other, for added management capabilities. Preliminary proximity estimations using BLE beacons in an urban outdoor environment show promising results with proximity accuracy consistently under 2 meters.

Therefore, a real-time unobtrusive monitoring of respiration patterns, as well as breath parameters, is a critical need in medical applications. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for patient home care, capable of measuring respiration rate and tidal volume variability via a wearable sensing technology. The proposed system is designed particularly for the goal of diagnosis and treatment in patients with pathological breathing, e.g., respiratory complications after surgery or sleep disorders. The complete system was comprised of wearable calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth low energy, and cloud database. The experiments are conducted with eight subjects and the overall error in respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.29%+/- 0.33% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. We also introduce a method for tidal volume variability estimation while validated using Pearson correlation. Furthermore, since it is essential to detect the critical events resulted from sudden rise or fall in per breath tidal volume of the patients, we provide a technique to automatically find the accurate threshold values based on each individual breath characteristics. Therefore, the system is able to detect the major changes, precisely by more than 98%, and provide immediate feedback such as sound alarm for round-the-clock respiration monitoring.

We have previously validated a cardiac monitoring system for AF detection pairing simple consumer-grade Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) heart rate (HR) sensors with a smartphone application (RITMIA (TM), Heart Sentinel srl, Italy). In the current study, we test a significant upgrade to the above-mentioned system, thanks to the technical capability of new HR sensors to run algorithms on the sensor itself and to acquire, and store on-board, single-lead ECG strips. We have reprogrammed an HR monitor intended for sports use (Movensense HR+) to run our proprietary RITMIA algorithm code in real-time, based on RR analysis, so that if any type of arrhythmia is detected, it triggers a brief retrospective recording of a single-lead ECG, providing tracings of the specific arrhythmia for later consultation. We report the initial data on the behavior, feasibility, and high diagnostic accuracy of this ultra-low weight customized device for standalone automatic arrhythmia detection and ECG recording, when several types of arrhythmias were simulated under different baseline conditions. Conclusions: The customized device was capable of detecting all types of simulated arrhythmias and correctly triggered a visually interpretable ECG tracing. Future human studies are needed to address real-life accuracy of this device.

The proposed 10-b ultralow-power isolated constant-slope digital-to-time converter (DTC) achieves a 580-fs resolution and a measured integral nonlinearity (INL) of 870 fs with 0.14-mW power consumption at 52 MS/s. A narrow-range time amplifier (TA)-time-to-digital converter (TDC) with gain calibration minimizes both the in-band phase noise degradation and the loop-bandwidth variation. In addition, a coarse-DPLL is introduced with dead-zone function, which reduces the phase lock time to 4.2 mu s at a 13-MHz frequency error. The coarse-DPLL monitors large frequency and phase jump in the background while consuming almost zero power. In an ultralow power mode, the proposed fractional-N ADPLL consumes a 0.65-mW power with a 26-MHz reference. A rms jitter of 1.00 ps and -50-dBc in-band fractional spur are achieved with a -242-dB FOM. In high-performance mode, a reference doubler is utilized, the jitter and spurs can be improved to 535 fs and -56 dBc, respectively, while consuming 0.98 mW. The proposed ADPLL with scalable power and jitter performance can be utilized for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi networks.

However, Bluetooth Low Energy tokens similar to those broadcast by existing apps can still be picked up far away from the transmitting device. In this paper, we present a new class of methods for detecting whether or not two WiFi-enabled devices are in immediate physical proximity, i.e. 2 or fewer meters apart, as established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Our goal is to enhance the accuracy of smartphone-based exposure notification and contact tracing systems. We present a set of binary machine learning classifiers that take as input pairs of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprints. We empirically verify that a single classifier cannot generalize well to a range of different environments with vastly different numbers of detectable Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). However, specialized classifiers, tailored to situations where the number of detectable APs falls within a certain range, are able to detect immediate physical proximity significantly more accurately. As such, we design three classifiers for situations with low, medium, and high numbers of detectable APs. These classifiers distinguish between pairs of RSSI fingerprints recorded 2 or fewer meters apart and pairs recorded further apart but still in Bluetooth range. We characterize their balanced accuracy for this task to be between 66.8% and 77.8%.

As a result, wireless transceivers in mobile devices, such as Bluetooth or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers, now have the potential to become contextual sensors by constantly interacting with nearby IoT wireless information beacons. In this work, we redefine these wireless transceivers as a new type of sensor, i.e., Wireless-as-a-Sensor (WaaS). However, current implementations of wireless transceivers are optimized as data transmitters for communication purposes, not for sensing, therefore directly implementing WaaS on a typical mobile device causes problems, such as an unacceptable reduction of battery life. To address this problem, we provide a novel smartphone-based architecture which utilizes an energy efficient sensor fusion core to execute always-on WaaS-related tasks. Based on this architecture, we further present a duty cycle determination algorithm that minimizes the power consumption while guaranteeing an application's Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Both the architecture and the algorithm are implemented and evaluated on a Moto X testbed with Bluetooth and RFID sensors, respectively, as two case studies. A Bluetooth-Low-Energy indoor location service is also implemented to verify and evaluate the architecture in real applications. Data measured on the Moto X testbed depicts that using the WaaS architecture prolongs the battery life 5 times than that on smartphone architecture.

The goal is to determine the shortcomings in healthcare services and improve the overall care paradigm to meet patient needs. Traditional methods for measuring patient experience have many limitations such as, survey length, infrequent sampling frequency, slow feedback, and a failure to integrate results into improving care. In this paper, we develop a location aware system, called PJM system, to measure patient experience in real time. It facilitates the analysis of results by stakeholders in order to highlight shortcomings in the service. We use a Bluetooth Low Energy based iBeacon. Our system consists of a smartphone application that senses the user location through iBeacon technology to deliver relevant content based on the location. It also includes a web-based platform with two interfaces: one for the patient experience admin and the other is for the patient experience decision-maker. The system gives the stakeholders the ability to design the patient's journey through the healthcare service. Also gives decision makers the ability to view survey results in a visual way. Visualisation is adopted as a means of presenting the survey results in an effective and efficient manner. This helps the decision makers obtain information in a rapid and efficient manner, thus enabling the identification of issues requiring rectification or improvement. Performance and user acceptance tests showed that the proposed system has many benefits.

J	Kim, MS; Lee, JG; Kang, SJ				Kim, Min Su; Lee, Jae Geun; Kang, Soon Ju			A Self-Organizing Interaction and Synchronization Method between a Wearable Device and Mobile Robot	SENSORS			English	Article						mobile robot; human following or leading; LF/RF pairing; device-to-device synchronization	SENSOR	In the near future, we can expect to see robots naturally following or going ahead of humans, similar to pet behavior. We call this type of robots "Pet-Bot". To implement this function in a robot, in this paper we introduce a self-organizing interaction and synchronization method between wearable devices and Pet-Bots. First, the Pet-Bot opportunistically identifies its owner without any human intervention, which means that the robot self-identifies the owner's approach on its own. Second, Pet-Bot's activity is synchronized with the owner's behavior. Lastly, the robot frequently encounters uncertain situations (e.g., when the robot goes ahead of the owner but meets a situation where it cannot make a decision, or the owner wants to stop the Pet-Bot synchronization mode to relax). In this case, we have adopted a gesture recognition function that uses a 3-D accelerometer in the wearable device. In order to achieve the interaction and synchronization in real-time, we use two wireless communication protocols: 125 kHz low-frequency (LF) and 2.4 GHz Bluetooth low energy (BLE). We conducted experiments using a prototype Pet-Bot and wearable devices to verify their motion recognition of and synchronization with humans in real-time. The results showed a guaranteed level of accuracy of at least 94%. A trajectory test was also performed to demonstrate the robot's control performance when following or leading a human in real-time.

J	Wagih, M; Beeby, S				Wagih, Mahmoud; Beeby, Steve			Thin Flexible RF Energy Harvesting Rectenna Surface With a Large Effective Aperture for Sub mu W/cm(2) Powering of Wireless Sensor Nodes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES			English	Article						Antennas; battery-less sensor nodes; energy harvesting (EH) surface; metamaterials; metasurfaces; radio frequency identification (RFID); rectennas; rectifiers; wireless power transfer	ELECTRICALLY SMALL; ANTENNA DESIGN; LOW-PROFILE; EFFICIENCY; ARRAY; SYSTEM; OUTPUT	The dc power collected by radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) absorbing surfaces is limited by their physical aperture. Here, a compact, conformable, and ultrathin sub-1 GHz large-area RFEH surface is proposed based on electrically small (ka = 0.58) "wire-type" rectenna elements, with an effective area exceeding its physical aperture size. Using optimized large-signal complex source tuning, the rectifiers achieve up to 36% measured power conversion efficiency (PCE) at -20 dBm. The proposed 15 cm-diameter six-element array generates a 27.5 mu W at 1 V output from a 0.17 mu W/cm(2) incident power density across a 40 k Omega load. Owing to its series connection, the voltage output is boosted, and the load resistance dependence is suppressed enabling over 60% of the maximum RF-to-dc PCE, to be preserved for loads between 7 and 100 k Omega, with an area-normalized figure-of-merit nearly 100% higher than previous arrays. The proposed array is integrated with a commercial DC-DC converter and demonstrated powering a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless sensor node (WSN) from an unprecedented incident power density of 0.25 mu W/cm(2). A practical demonstration using a commercial 3 W, 915 MHz Powercast source is presented, showing an 11 m operation range with a 1 V output and illustrating the impact of polarization mismatch on the proposed array.

The transponder (back-)scatters the incident RF signal by reflecting and modulating such that it is receivable by a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) receiver of a mobile telephone. This scattering includes signal modulation with a 4 MHz frequency shift of the incident signal and frequency shift keying for information transmission. Modulation is controlled by a low energy micro-controller, which receives its operational energy from a RF harvesting circuit that accumulates energy from the incident RF signal. In contrast to our previously used continuous wave transmitter, the present work studies the feasibility of using the BLE transmitter of a further mobile telephone for providing the incident RF signal. This approach requires dealing with the intermittent nature of practical wireless communication, which motivates us to use features of the BLE Standard version 5.0, namely the extended advertizing messages and their periodic re-transmissions. Our experiments involve a specifically designed code sequence, which generates a quasi-continuous wave signal of approx. 2 ms duration, which provides the basis for the transponder's scattering process. Thus, by using energy and waveform of a RF signal from a transmitting mobile telephone we achieved wireless communication from a battery-less transponder to a separate receiving mobile telephone, which encourages further endeavors in this direction.

HIRO-NET is an emergency infrastructure-less network tailored to address the problem of providing connectivity in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, where no cellular or wide area network is operational and no Internet access is available. HIRO-NET establishes a two-tier wireless mesh network where the Lower Tier connects nearby survivors in a self-organized mesh via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the Upper Tier creates long-range VHF links between autonomous robots exploring the disaster stricken area. HIRO-NET main goal is to enable users in the disaster to exchange text messages in order to share critical information and request help from first responders. The mesh network discovery problem is analyzed and a network protocol specifically designed to facilitate the exploration process is presented. We show how HIRO-NET robots successfully discover, bridge and interconnect local mesh networks. Results show that the Lower Tier always reaches network convergence and the Upper Tier can virtually extend HIRO-NET functionalities to the range of a small metropolitan area. In the event of an Internet connection still being available to some user, HIRO-NET is able to opportunistically share and provide access to low data-rate services (e.g. Twitter, Gmail) to the whole network. Results suggest that a temporary emergency network to cover a metropolitan area can be created in tens of minutes.

This framework is composed by a low-cost, low-energy sensor installed in recycling containers to measure fill level and other physical parameters, together with a mobile app and an associated web-based server. The sensor is activated magnetically each time the container lid is opened by a user. Instead of directly sending this information to a cloud-based server, our sensor broadcasts a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet to the surrounding area. An app running in the mobile phone of the user performs two actions: To capture this information, re-sending it to the cloud-based server, and to assign credits to this particular user for having used the recycling container. In this way, users are rewarded for using the container, and the infrastructure benefits from cost-free communications from the container to the server. During the first semester of 2019, we have launched a pilot demonstration of the STERLING solution at different schools of the University of Valladolid. This test included the deployment of ten STERLING recycling containers, making a public presentation to encourage users to improve their recycling habits, and running a rewarding mechanisms consisting on Amazon gift cards. In this paper we describe the experience in detail, showing the advantages and weaknesses of our solution, discussing some interesting lessons learned from this experience, and pointing to further research directions.

J	D'Angelo, G; Palmieri, F				D'Angelo, Gianni; Palmieri, Francesco			Enhancing COVID-19 tracking apps with human activity recognition using a deep convolutional neural network and HAR-images	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						COVID-19; Tracking app; CNN; Health monitoring system; Health monitoring devices; Healthcare; e-Health; IoT	TECHNOLOGY	With the emergence of COVID-19, mobile health applications have increasingly become crucial in contact tracing, information dissemination, and pandemic control in general. Apps warn users if they have been close to an infected person for sufficient time, and therefore potentially at risk. The distance measurement accuracy heavily affects the probability estimation of being infected. Most of these applications make use of the electromagnetic field produced by Bluetooth Low Energy technology to estimate the distance. Nevertheless, radio interference derived from numerous factors, such as crowding, obstacles, and user activity can lead to wrong distance estimation, and, in turn, to wrong decisions. Besides, most of the social distance-keeping criteria recognized worldwide plan to keep a different distance based on the activity of the person and on the surrounding environment. In this study, in order to enhance the performance of the COVID-19 tracking apps, a human activity classifier based on Convolutional Deep Neural Network is provided. In particular, the raw data coming from the accelerometer sensor of a smartphone are arranged to form an image including several channels (HAR-Image), which is used as fingerprints of the in-progress activity that can be used as an additional input by tracking applications. Experimental results, obtained by analyzing real data, have shown that the HAR-Images are effective features for human activity recognition. Indeed, the results on the k-fold cross-validation and obtained by using a real dataset achieved an accuracy very close to 100%.

With the development of many applications for the IoT, indoor localization, i.e., the capability to determine the physical location of people or devices, has become an important component of smart homes. Various wireless technologies have been used for indoor localization including WiFi, ultra-wideband (UWB), Bluetooth low energy (BLE), radio-frequency identification (RFID), and LoRa. The ability of low-cost long range (LoRa) radios for low-power and long-range communication has made this radio technology a suitable candidate for many indoor and outdoor IoT applications. Additionally, research studies have shown the feasibility of localization with LoRa radios. However, indoor localization with LoRa is not adequately explored at the home level, where the localization area is relatively smaller than offices and corporate buildings. In this study, we first explore the feasibility of ranging with LoRa. Then, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the capability of LoRa for accurate and precise indoor localization in a typical apartment setting. Our experimental results show that LoRa-based indoor localization has an accuracy better than 1.6 m in line-of-sight scenario and 3.2 m in extreme non-line-of-sight scenario with a precision better than 25 cm in all cases, without using any data filtering on the location estimates.

In large spaces, multiple HVAC terminals are typically installed to provide cooperative services for different thermal zones, and the occupancy information determines the cooperation among terminals. However, a person count at room-level does not adequately optimize HVAC system operation due to the movement of occupants within the room that creates uneven load distribution. Without accurate knowledge of the occupants' spatial distribution, the uneven distribution of occupants often results in under-cooling/heating or over-cooling/heating in some thermal zones. Therefore, the lack of high-resolution occupancy distribution is often perceived as a bottleneck for future improvements to HVAC operation efficiency. To fill this gap, this study proposes a multi-feature k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) classification algorithm to extract occupancy distribution through reliable, low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks. An on-site experiment was conducted in a typical office of an institutional building to demonstrate the proposed methods, and the experiment outcomes of three case studies were examined to validate detection accuracy. One method based on City Block Distance (CBD) was used to measure the distance between detected occupancy distribution and ground truth and assess the results of occupancy distribution. The results show the accuracy when CBD = 1 is over 71.4% and the accuracy when CBD = 2 can reach up to 92.9%.

Energy-autonomous wireless sensor nodes for automotive applications, powered by thermoelectric energy harvesting	16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MICRO AND NANOTECHNOLOGY FOR POWER GENERATION AND ENERGY CONVERSION APPLICATIONS (POWERMEMS 2016)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Micro- and Nano-Technology for Power Generation and Energy Conversion Applications (PowerMEMS)	DEC 06-09, 2016	Paris, FRANCE					In this paper we will first present the measurement of temperatures on different positions at a diesel-powered car. As a result, several locations are identified as suitable to implement a wireless sensor node powered by thermal energy harvesting. Based on the data gained a thermoelectric generator (TEG) has been selected, and measurements of energy generation have been performed. Further, a complete energy-autonomous wireless sensor node was designed, including the TEG with its mounting bracket, an electronic power management, and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor node. Based on temperature differences from -10 K up to 75.3 K occurring in test drives, a low power set up was chosen to achieve a system startup time below 10 minutes and to ensure service even under difficult ambient conditions, like high ambient temperatures or a slow movement of the car in stocking traffic. 2 minutes after starting the engine a power about of 10 mW is available from the chosen TEG, and in peak the power exceeds 1 W. In a 50 minute test drive it was possible to generate 650 J of energy.

The main goal is monitoring of selected physiological processes that might be very useful in health care and monitoring during sport activities. The monitoring device, based on an on-body sensor, is designed with respect to small size, low power consumption as well as interoperability. Therefore, it is equipped with a microcontroller with RF module for ZigBee PRO or ANT+ networks. Measured data is sent through the wireless network to an acquisition point, which collects the data and transfers it to a database server. Here, the data is stored and can be accessed remotely via internet. This system is mainly aimed at home health care, so it should be able to communicate with standard personal devices such as cellphone, notebook/netbook, PC, tablet, etc. For this reason, the acquisition point is able to communicate via Bluetooth standard as well as Bluetooth low energy (for future use). Through this network, user can view live data as well as data stored in the database server. As an example, the system for monitoring of psycho-galvanic reflex of the human skin will be shown. The communication between the acquisition point and sensor is based on ZigBee PRO network and communication between the acquisition point and visualization device uses Bluetooth network, since recently, this is the most common interface used in portable devices.

According to travel projections in the UK, the number of journeys for rail passengers is likely to double over the next 30 years. This creates the need to improve passenger throughput while still maintaining revenue protection. The proposed solution is to create a 'Gateless Gateline': a concept in which a user can seamlessly authenticate the intent to travel in train stations using current ticketing media ranging from barcode and Bluetooth low energy to radio-frequency identification, as well as new and emerging ticketing media, specifically related to biometrics. This article focuses on utilizing three-dimensional (3D) face recognition based on photometric stereo using near-infrared (NIR) light to illuminate a face for a 3D construction and tracking for the purpose of associating the correct biometric identifier with the correct person in a high-throughput environment. Other biometric systems have also been investigated as part of this project, i.e. palm vein scanning based on passing NIR light through the palm. There are challenges when it comes to associating passengers with valid travel tokens in a system which is free flowing and does not have a modus operandi of a standard access gate where validation occurs one at a time, normally signalled by paddles opening and closing. The proposed solution to the above, alongside the known issues associated with scaling biometric solutions, is reported in this article.

J	Tran, TV; Chung, WY				Thang Viet Tran; Chung, Wan-Young			High-Efficient Energy Harvester With Flexible Solar Panel for a Wearable Sensor Device	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Energy harvesting; flexible solar panel; maximum power point tracker (MPPT); wearable devices	PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS; NODES	This paper proposes an optimal energy harvester (OEH) that uses a flexible photovoltaic (FPV) module to prolong battery life for a wearable body sensor node under indoor and outdoor conditions. The proposed sensor node uses a Bluetooth low- energy module, which consumes low power to wirelessly communicate with mobile devices for monitoring vital signals. A 19 cm x 4 cm FPV module that can easily conform to human body contours is used for generating a peak- power of up to 500 mW to charge the battery in outdoor environments. To optimize the power collected under various irradiances, the OEH is designed with a boost circuit for harvesting the low energy available indoors and a maximum power point tracker for collecting the high energy that is available outdoors. The booster can operate within a wide input voltage range of 0.65- 3 V to generate a stable output voltage of 3.3 V, and it has a high conversion efficiency of similar to 95%. The MPPT uses fuzzy inference engine to find the MPP of the FPV that is required to power the system. The results of our experiment show that the proposed device can prolong the lifetime by up to 950% under an irradiance of only 2.9 mW/cm(2), and the proposed node becomes an autonomous node under partial shading and sunlight conditions. Therefore, this paper can provide a useful solution for extending the lifetime of wearable sensor devices.

The noninvasive implementation, nondestructive effect on the material to be applied, and low cost of the needed components give an advantage to the ultrasonic systems when compared to other methods for analysis and process monitoring studies. However, the current ultrasonic analysis setups used in the studies require additional devices such as a signal generator and oscilloscope. These devices used in the setup increase the cost, size, usage difficulty of the system and, most importantly, decrease the portability and stability. In order to prevent these disadvantages, an ultrasonic system that can work in real-time and its software are developed to be used in analysis and process monitoring without any additional devices. Methods This system was designed by using a microcontroller. The developed system is portable, has a small size, and a Bluetooth Low Energy connection. It has a battery for using standalone. Results Therefore, it can be easily used in different small and closed measurement environments such as incubators and controlled remotely. In addition, a mixture was analyzed with both the designed system and a commercial module. When the results are compared, two systems are found highly correlated (r2=1). Conclusion In this study, an embedded ultrasonic measurement system and its software are developed to be used in analysis studies, density measurements, and real-time process monitoring as a stand-alone device.

It comprises an LNA, RF mixer, transconductance ( gm) stage, IF mixer, transimpedance amplifier (TIA), and LO generation block. We present a comprehensive analysis of the second-order intermodulation (IM2) distortion that is induced by an in-band orthogonal frequency-division modulation (OFDM) blocker and its effects on the receiver input sensitivity. Based on the analysis, an in-band two-tone blocker tolerance test procedure is proposed, and an IM2 calibration circuit to enhance the receiver's IM2 tolerance is presented. Furthermore, a conflict issue in the cooptimization of IM2 calibration at the IF mixer stage and dc offset calibration at the subsequent baseband amplifier stage is alleviated. This is achieved by employing a body bias control method for the dc offset calibration and a gate bias control method for the IM2 calibration. A BLE RF receiver integrated circuit was fabricated in a 65-nm RF CMOS process. Dissipating 3.55 mW from a 1-V supply, it achieves a gain control range from +2 to +62 dB, a minimum noise figure of 3 dB, and an out-of-band (OOB) single-tone blocker tolerance level of -10 dBm. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed IM2 calibration circuit significantly improves the in-band twotone blocker tolerance level by 7-12 dB, achieving its range from -41 to -31 dBm.

IoT based devices mainly use wireless technology like WiFi, Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication. Due to the large number of IoT devices and limited spectrum in the Radio Frequency band the system suffers from bandwidth crunch. Hence, the high bandwidth capacity of visible light provides the solution to the spectral crisis. So, the visible light based new wireless technology opens up a new domain of integrated communication system with sensors using lights. The LED beams transmit information from the transmitter's side to the photo-detector on the receiver's side. But, the photodetector is affected by fluctuations in the brightness of ambient light and also by the variations in the distance between transmitter and receiver. To solve these problems, we design a hardware circuit to eliminate the effect of ambient light during transmission and also remove the effect of the variable intensity of transmitted LED power introduced due to change in the relative distance between the transmitter and receiver. In the experimental setup we use 5mm RED LED and OPT101 photodiode as transmitter and receiver respectively. Our experimental setup can eliminate up to 273 lux ambient light and detect bits correctly upto a bit duration of 1 mu s	[Datta, Kashi Nath; Das, Pradipta; Saha, Mousumi; Saha, Sujoy] Natl Inst Technol Durgapur, Dept CSE, Durgapur, W Bengal, India	National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Durgapur	Datta, KN (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Durgapur, Dept CSE, Durgapur, W Bengal, India.	kashi.re2014@gmail.com; dasspradipta@gmail.com; msaha.nitd@gmail.com; sujoy.ju@gmail.com	saha, sujoy/AAR-9470-2020	saha, sujoy/0000-0003-4483-5758	National Institute of Technology Durgapur	National Institute of Technology Durgapur(National Institute of Technology Durgapur)	This publication is an outcome of the R&D work undertaken under the project "IoT based system designing using Visible Light Communication" funded by National Institute of Technology Durgapur.		5	1	1	0	3	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA			978-1-4503-7751-5				2020										10.1145/3369740.3372758	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3369740.3372758			4	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Telecommunications	BR5WN					2023-06-19	WOS:000657955200038

To satisfy the rising demands of ubiquitous connections, billions of multi-radio gateways have to be deployed, inevitably incurring high deployment cost and extra traffic overhead. Recent advances on Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) have shown its ability to avoid these drawbacks. However, the state-of-the-art CTCs from Bluetooth to WiFi, two of the most popular wireless techniques, still suffer from low data-rate (e.g., 3.1Kbps), which severely restricts their applicability. We present BlueFi, the first physical-layer CTC (PHY-CTC) from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to WiFi, which enables high throughput, bidirectional and parallel transmissions between BLE and WiFi via spectral analysis. The key observation is that commodity WiFi chipsets can operate in the spectral analysis mode, in which WiFi can recognize specific BLE signal waveforms in frequency domain at symbol-level granularity. Leveraging this feature, we manufacture desired waveforms by choosing frame payload at BLE side, and observe spectral patterns at WiFi side. To achieve bidirectional links, we design a PHY-CTC method from WiFi to BLE based on signal emulation. We implement our prototype on USRP (with 802.11g PHY) and commodity BLE devices. Extensive evaluations show that BlueFi can achieve 120Kbps per link from BLE to WiFi with more than 95% frame reception ratio, over 38x faster than state-of-the-art CTCs. Moreover, BlueFi can support 9 wireless links in parallel, leading to the total throughput over 1Mbps.

System Level Design of RF Receivers Based on Non Linear Optimization and Power Consumption Models	RADIOENGINEERING			English	Article						System level design; power consumption model; RF receiver; LTE; nonlinear optimization		This work presents a method to optimally distribute the block specifications in an RF receiver in order to reduce power consumption. The parameters are Gain (G), Noise Figure (NF) and Input Third Order Intercept Point (IIP3). The method is based on setting the signal quality per block at the output; Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for noise and Signal to Noise plus Distortion ratio (SNDR) for linearity. Both are limited in order to fulfill the sensitivity and intermodulation tests of a given standard. Nonlinear power models can be used as the method is based on heuristics associated with non linear optimization. First, random valid sets are tested "A" times, while the best candidate is chosen as starting point for a nonlinear optimization with bounds based on interior point algorithm. The process is repeated "B" times, and the best candidate is chosen. To validate the method, a direct-conversion receiver was dimensioned for the Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Bluetooth Low Energy (B-LE) standards. Three power models were used, labeled PM1, PM2 and PM3. First the LTE is considered. When compared to predetermined signal quality distributions, the method reduced the power consumption by 65% and 41%, considering PM1 and PM2, respectively. Then the B-LE is chosen with power model 2. This model is linear and has an analytical minimum derived in the literature. The optimization achieved a precision of 0.2% to the analytical minimum using A = 1000 and B = 15.	[Lolis, Luis H.

Couriers' real-time localization plays a key role in on-demand delivery for all parties like the platform's order dispatching, merchants' order preparing, couriers' navigation, and customers' shopping experience. Although GPS has well solved outdoor localization, indoor localization is still challenging due to the lack of large-coverage, low-cost anchors. Given the high penetration of smartphones in merchants and frequent rendezvous between merchants and couriers, we employ merchants' smartphones as indoor anchors for a new sensing opportunity. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate SmartLOC, a map-free localization system that employs merchants' smartphones as anchors to obtain couriers' real-time locations. Specifically, we design a rendezvous detection module based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), build indoor shop graphs for each mall, and adopt graph embedding to extract indoor shops' topology. To guarantee anchors' accuracy and privacy, we build a mutual localization module to iteratively infer merchants' state (in-shop or not) and couriers' locations with transformer models.

In many applications, BLE and TSCH networks may be deployed in the vicinity of one another, which may lead to Cross Technology Interference (CTI) influencing each other's performance. Both technologies utilize channel hopping to alleviate the impact of external interferences. However, having a model to quantitatively estimate the performance of coexisting TSCH and BLE networks and analyze the role of networks' configuration settings is still an open problem. To address this, we provide a probabilistic analysis of collision-free communication of coexisting BLE and TSCH networks. Moreover, a fast coexistence simulation model is developed that computes the ratio of collision-free transmissions. This model is used to investigate how the performance of the coexisting networks may deviate from the results of the probabilistic analysis. It gives the designers a proper estimation of the worst case performance degradation due to such coexistence. It is shown that severity of the impact of coexisting BLE-TSCH networks on one another depends on the setup configurations and the relative timing of the two networks. The results show that these two technologies can coexist well with collision-free ratios of more than 92.58% and 96.29% in the tested configurations for TSCH and BLE, respectively.

With the acceleration of aging, demands for elder care services have increased dramatically. Gateway deployments for Internet of Things (IoT) play an important role to support such services over remote intelligent healthcare platforms, in particular when allowing patients wearing wireless medical devices to walk freely in wards or indoor spaces. The gateway deployment problem becomes much more complicated under this condition due to obstacles and human bodies in the way between the gateways and the patients. In addition, the hardware specification of a gateway and the signal shadowing by patients themselves also limit the connectivity capacity of a gateway. These motivate us to study a design that takes all the factors of indoor floor plan, radio propagation attenuation, user densities, and human body signal shadowing into the consideration of gateway deployment. Particular features of our proposed algorithm include: 1) guaranteeing a full signal coverage; 2) accounting for patients' self-shadowing effects; and 3) adapting to non-uniform user densities in different spaces of indoor environments. The average user service continuity degree can reach up to 0.99 in indoors with various sizes of room spaces and user densities. Moreover, performances of the average gateway serving load implies the selected locations to deploy gateways are adequate.

Aiming at the problem of low positioning accuracy in the transition area between indoor and outdoor, and it is difficult to achieve smooth switching, this article proposes an indoor and outdoor seamless positioning system for smartphones based on environment perception. Firstly, based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), we use smartphone observation data to select optimal features to construct an environmental perception model. Secondly, by increasing the magnetic field strength as an observation feature, the time delay for switching between different environments is shortened. Finally, based on the environmental perception results, a seamless indoor and outdoor positioning system is constructed. In the transition area between indoor and outdoor, to ensure the reliability of the positioning system, a Global Navigation Satellite System/ Inertial Navigation System/ Bluetooth Low Energy (GNSS/INS/BLE) integrated positioning model is proposed. In the outdoor and outdoor transition areas, we refine the stochastic model, which significantly improves the accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate the system performance, experiments are carried out in a complex environment. The experimental results show that the proposed perception model can accurately identify the changes of the environment, and the accuracy of judgment reaches more than 95%. It can support the seamless positioning system to select appropriate positioning models in different environments to achieve accurate and continuous positioning. The maximum positioning error does not exceed 0.5m.

Techniques based on signal surveys (fingerprint maps) are arguably the most prevalent today, but these rely on time-consuming, complex manual surveys of the signal propagation. Recently progress has been made in semi-automated surveying, where Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithms are combined with signal measurements using Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) techniques first developed in robotics. In this work we advocate the use of a dedicated surveyor whose trajectory is estimated using a SLAM based PDR corrected using magnetic signals. Magnetic signals are fast varying indoors, but have poor spatial locality. We show how to match sequences of magnetic measurements within a survey walk in order to identify loops in the trajectory for the SLAM algorithm. Having estimated a trajectory, we build WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal maps using Gaussian Processes regression. Magnetic maps are not used for positioning. We test our system in a range of testbeds. We find magnetic SLAM to estimate the trajectory of a 10 minute walk to high accuracy (average error of any point 73 cm, subjective-objective error 22 cm). The resultant signal maps are found to give good positioning accuracies within 3-4 m of the trajectory and come close to the manual survey accuracies, despite requiring significantly less manual effort. We believe our system offers a robust and easy way to survey an environment.

The practical use of these algorithms for securing networks will depend on their computational and communication efficiency. In particular, this is critical for the security of wireless communications within the context of consumer IoT devices that may have limited computational power and depend on a constrained wireless bandwidth. To this end, there is a need to evaluate the performance of widely used application layer security standards such as transport layer security (TLS) to understand the use of the existing PQ algorithms that are being evaluated by NIST as a replacement to the current cryptographic algorithms. This paper focuses on two widely used IoT standards Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi to find out the optimal performing PQ algorithm for their security when used in end-to-end connections over the Internet. By implementing the capability for IP over BLE and all options of TLS connection establishment, we developed a client-server IoT testbed to measure the efficiency of PQ key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and PQ digital signature algorithms. The test results showed that Kyber512 is the ideal KEM while Falcon-512 and Dilithium2 are the best signatures for BLE and WiFi devices. Based on this outcome, we developed a mechanism for IoT devices with multiple communication interfaces, that dynamically chooses a PQ KEM algorithm based on the MAC layer protocol being used at the time.

The digitalized ECG codes are converted from a front-end circuit, which contains several amplifiers and filters in the acquisition system. Thereafter, a zero padding scheme is applied for each 10-bits data to separate them into two-bytes data for BLE transmission. Xavier Edge AI platform receives these transmitted data and removes the electrode motion (EM) noise using the proposed low memory shortcut connection-based denoised autoencoder (LMSC-DAE). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 5.41 dB under the condition of SNRin = 12 dB, compared with convolutional denoising autoencoder with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM-DAE) method. For practical test, an Arduino DUE platform is employed to generate noise interference by controlling a commercial digital-to-analog convertor. By combining the proposed ECG acquisition device with a non-inverting weighted summer, it can be applied to verify the reproducibility of measurement for the proposed method. The measurement results clearly indicate that the proposed LMSC-DAE has a higher improvement of SNR and lower percentage root-mean-square difference than the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (FCN-DAE).

To address these GNSS outages, pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is commonly used due to its significant improvements in both the stability and continuity of positioning, which are dependent on three key factors: continuous absolute position, heading and step information. Signals of opportunity are commonly used in positioning, whereas the installation of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors on lampposts can provide an opportunity for positioning and heading estimation in urban canyons. In this article, a system integrating the GNSS, PDR, and BLE techniques is implemented in smartphones to provide a real-time positioning solution for pedestrians, which includes a new position correction method based on BLE heading, a reliable heading estimation integrating BLE and inertial sensors, an unconstrained step detection method with high accuracy, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to integrate multiple sensors and techniques. In several field experiments, with improvements in availability and robustness, the heading accuracy of the proposed fusion approach could reach approximately 3 degrees; the positioning accuracy achieved between 2.7 m and 4.2 m, compared with a 30 m error from the GNSS alone. Simultaneously, this system could achieve a high positioning accuracy of 2.4 m with unconstrained smartphones in a mixed environment. The proposed system has been demonstrated to perform well in urban canyons.

Deep learning classification algorithms have been used to recognize the wireless signal standards of emitters with high accuracy, but are limited to classifying signal classes that appear in their training set. This diminishes the performance of deep learning classifiers deployed in the field because they cannot accurately identify signals from classes outside of the training set. In this paper, a convolution neural network based open set classifier is proposed with the ability to detect signal that are not from known classes by thresholding the output sigmoid activation. The open set classifier was trained on 4G LTE, 5G NR, IEEE 802.11ax, Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0, and Narrowband Internet-of-Things signals impaired with Rayleigh or Rician fading, AWGN, frequency offsets, and in-phase/quadrature imbalances. Then, the classifier was tested on OFDM, SC-FDMA, SC, AM, and FM signals, which did not appear in the training set classes. The closed set classifier achieves an average accuracy of 94.5% for known signals with SNR's greater than 0 dB, but by design, the closed set classifier cannot detect signals from unknown classes.

J	Camal, L; Aksanli, B				Camal, Luis; Aksanli, Baris			Building an Energy-Efficient Ad-Hoc Network for Wildlife Observation	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						ad-hoc mesh network; energy-efficient; network throughput; wildlife observation		This study evaluated the design of an energy-efficient ad-hoc network used for wildlife observations, particularly in order to understand the social relationships in an animal group, where the distance between individuals, i.e., proximity, can be used to measure a relationship. Our proposed network consists of a full mesh topology and contains nodes that communicate via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in advertisement mode. The initial hardware configuration and software algorithm duty cycles the BLE communication to on and off states using a parameter called the BLE active triggering interval. The algorithm is improved by placing the BLE subsystem and CPU in deep sleep when there are no BLE or CPU tasks to process. This improves the power performance by up to 94.48%. To scale up power optimization and track the trade-off between power and throughput, we created a simulator that modeled our network with dynamic wireless sensor nodes. The simulator verified the base case hardware results. It also showed a median power performance increase of 97.79% in comparison to the base case, yet throughput decreased by 66.65%. The highest power performance increased by 98.89% when a wireless sensor node was configured with a BLE active triggering interval of 50 s and its CPU was set to 14 MHz; however, the simulator showed a throughput drop of 79.97%. Depending on the application, a design may tolerate the decline in throughput to achieve higher power performance.

This identification is achieved by gathering the location information of the target user by using a wearable beacon embedded with a magnetometer and inertial sensors. The shortcomings of beacon-signal stability and mismatch issues in magnetic-field sequences are overcome by adopting a hybrid, three-phase approach for deducing the locus of micro-activities and their associated zones in a smart home environment. The suggested approach is assessed in two different test environments, where the main intention is to map the location of a person performing an activity with pre-defined house landmarks and zones in the offline labeled database. In addition to the recognition of low-level activities, the proposed method also identifies the person's walking trajectory within the same zone or between different zones of the house. The experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve centimeter-level accuracy for the recognition of micro-activities and to achieve the classification accuracy of 85% for trajectory prediction. These results are encouraging and imply that the collection of accurate low-level information for ADL recognition is possible using integration of inertial sensors, magnetic field and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technologies from the wearable beacon without relying on other infrastructural sensors.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is designed for IoT devices, and its received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has been used in distance and proximity estimation, though they are noisy and unreliable. In this study, we leverage the BLE TX power level in BLE models. We adopt a comparative analysis framework that utilizes our extensive data library of measurements. It considers commonly used state-of-the-art model, in addition to our data-driven proposed approach. The RSSI and TX power are integrated into several parametric models such as log shadowing and Android Beacon library models, and machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks. Specific mobile apps are developed for the study experiment. We have collected more than 1.8 millions of BLE records between encounters with various distances that range from 0.5 to 22 meters in an indoor environment. Interestingly, considering TX power when estimating the distance reduced the mean errors by up to 46% in parametric models and by up to 35% in machine learning models. Also, the proximity classification accuracy increased by up to 103% and 70% in parametric and machine learning models, respectively. This work is one of the first studies (if not the first) that analyze in depth the TX power variations in improving the distance estimation and classification.

QuickCal: Assisted Calibration for Crystal-Free Micromotes	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						6TiSCH; calibration; crystal-free; single-chip micro mote (SC mu M); single-chip mote	PERFORMANCE; 6TISCH	The single-chip micro mote (SC mu M) is a crystal-free single-chip mote that brings us one step closer to the Smart Dust vision, in particular, as it can communicate with off-the-shelf IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth low energy devices. However, before it can be part of such networks, the crystal-free SC mu M chip needs to be able to accurately tune its communication frequency to synchronize to the network. This is a challenge since its onboard RC and LC-based resonating circuits have a drift rate that can be three orders of magnitude worse than crystal-based oscillators typically used in today's radios. This article introduces QuickCal, a solution that allows an SC mu M chip to self-calibrate against off-the-shelf devices dedicated to assisting with its calibration. We show that an SC mu M chip can self-calibrate against this QuickCal Box in fewer than 3 min. We further validate that once it has self-calibrated, an SC mu M chip can reliably communicate with off-the-shelf IEEE802.15.4 devices. Finally, we demonstrate a heterogeneous network-composed of an SC mu M chip and an OpenMote device-implementing a full 6TiSCH Industrial IoT protocol stack, which uses time synchronization and channel hopping. This is the first time that a crystal-free radio is participating in a channel-hopping-enabled TSCH network.

However, it is difficult to trace people who came into contact with an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission, and mass infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government Privacy-Preserving Mobile, and Fog computing framework entitled PPMF that can trace infected, and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with contact tracing app, and two types of stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk Checkers (ARC), and Suspected User Data Uploader Node (SUDUN), to trace community transmission alongside maintaining user data privacy. Each user's mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when registering on the central application. The mobile device, and the central application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC), which broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The ARCs are placed at the entry points of buildings, which can immediately detect if there are positive or suspected cases nearby. If any confirmed case is found, the ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the identity of the infected person. The SUDUNs are placed at the health centers that report test results to the central cloud application. The reported data is later used to map between infected, and suspected cases. Therefore, using our proposed PPMF framework, governments can let organizations continue their economic activities without complete lockdown.

Hybrid Positioning for Smart Spaces: Proposal and Evaluation	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						hybrid positioning; fingerprinting; indoor positioning; smart buildings; mobile devices	INDOOR	Positioning capabilities have become essential in context-aware user services, which make easier daily activities and let the emergence of new business models in the trendy area of smart cities. Thanks to wireless connection capabilities of smart mobile devices and the proliferation of wireless attachment points in buildings, several positioning systems have appeared in the last years to provide indoor positioning and complement GPS for outdoors. Wi-Fi fingerprinting is one of the most remarkable approaches, although ongoing smart deployments in the area of smart cities can offer extra possibilities to exploit hybrid schemes, in which the final location takes into account different positioning sources. In this paper we propose a positioning system that leverages common infrastructure and services already present in smart spaces to enhance indoor positioning. Thus, GPS and WiFi are complemented with access control services (i.e., ID card) or Bluetooth Low Energy beaconing, to determine the user location within a smart space. Better position estimations can be calculated by hybridizing the positioning information coming from different technologies, and a handover mechanism between technologies or algorithms is used exploiting semantic information saved in fingerprints. The solution implemented is highly optimized by reducing tedious computation, by means of opportunistic selection of fingerprints and floor change detection, and a battery saving subsystem reduces power consumption by disabling non-needed technologies. The proposal has been showcased over a smart campus deployment to check its real operation and assess the positioning accuracy, experiencing the noticeable advantage of integrating technologies usually available in smart spaces and reaching an average real error of 4.62 m.

It addresses the whole pipeline from data acquisition over data processing to data visualization including wearable integration. ECG signals are recorded with a novel ECG sensor supporting Bluetooth Low Energy, which is able to transmit raw ECG data as well as estimated heart rate. ECG signals are processed in real-time on a mobile device to automatically classify the user's heart beats. A novel application for Android-based mobile devices was developed for data visualization. It offers several modes for cardiac feedback, from measuring the current heart rate to continuously monitoring the user's heart status. It also allows to store acquired data in an internal database as well as in the Google Fit platform. Further, the application provides extensions for wearables like Google Glass and smartwatches running on Android Wear. Hardware performance evaluation was performed by comparing the course of heart rate between the novel ECG sensor and a commercial ECG sensor. The mean absolute error between the two sensors was 4.83 bpm with a standard deviation of 4.46 bpm, and a Pearson correlation of 0.922. A qualitative evaluation was performed for the Android application with special emphasis on the daily usability and the wearable integration. When the Google Glass was integrated, the subjects rated the application as 2.8/5 (0 = Bad, 5 = Excellent), whereas when the application was integrated with a smartwatch the rating increased to 4.2/5.

In this review paper we analyze innovative wearable systems for limiting the virus spread, early detection of the first symptoms of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 infection, and remote monitoring of the health conditions of infected patients during the quarantine. The attention is focused on systems allowing quick user screening through ready-to-use hardware and software components. Such sensor-based systems monitor the principal vital signs, detect symptoms related to COVID-19 early, and alert patients and medical staff. Novel wearable devices for complying with social distancing rules and limiting interpersonal contagion (such as smart masks) are investigated and analyzed. In addition, an overview of implantable devices for monitoring the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is presented. Then we report an overview of tracing strategies and technologies for containing the COVID-19 pandemic based on IoT technologies, wearable devices, and cloud computing.

J	Yu, CM; Ku, ML; Wang, LC				Yu, Chih-Min; Ku, Meng-Lin; Wang, Li-Chun			DTC-HSR: Distributed Topology Control and Hierarchical Self-Routing for Bluetooth Load Balancing Networks	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Topology; Network topology; Bluetooth; Routing; Routing protocols; Bridges; Spread spectrum communication; Hierarchical routing; load balance; mesh-ring network; topology construction	SCATTERNET FORMATION; ALGORITHM	In this article, a distributed topology control approach with hierarchical self-routing (DTC-HSR) is presented for Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) networks. First, the conventional star piconet is replaced by the designed mesh-ring subnet with better throughput and lower delay. To achieve the goal of load balancing design, two phases, including the leader selection and the topology construction are executed in the proposed approach. In the leader selection phase, each master node discovers its adjacent slave nodes to determine a leader master as a coordinator. In the topology construction phase, the local mesh-ring subnet is first formed and then the global mesh-ring subnets are interconnected into the desired DTC-HSR topology. To form the local mesh-ring subnet, each leader master computes the desired number of piconets with even link connectivity and distributes the piconet connection information for each node to form a mesh-ring subnet. In addition, each master node connects with the other local mesh-ring subnets via its associated bridge nodes, including slave nodes, intrabridges, and interbridges to create the definitive DTC-HSR scatternet. Afterward, a hierarchical self-routing strategy is jointly employed for the DTC-HSR to efficiently deliver routed packets through different mesh-ring subnets. Simulation results demonstrate that the DTC-HSR topology with the even connectivity feature outperforms the dual-ring tree (DRT) and cluster-based mesh (CBM) approaches in terms of network transmission and energy efficiency performances. The DTC-HSR configuration thus achieves efficient topology construction and hierarchical self-routing for load balancing in BLE networks.

J	Hoon, J; Cha, SH				Hoon, Jae; Cha, Seung Hyun			A user-specific activity pattern generation framework for evidence-based ABW planning	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Activity-based workplace; Space planning; Workplace design; Activity recognition; Accelerometer; BLE beacon		To plan successful activity-based workplaces (ABW), architects need to clearly understand user-specific activity patterns through the accurate recognition of user activity. Because user activity is closely associated with space, equipment, and users, such diverse activity-related information should be essentially considered for accurate activity recognition. However, previous activity recognition methods have limitations for accurately recognizing user activity for ABW planning, because they only relied on sensor-estimated data and are, therefore, unable to comprehensively consider diverse activity-related information. The study thus integrates site investigation and sensor estimation using a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon and accelerometer for accurately recognizing user activity based on diverse activity-related information. We defined five important items of activity-related information (user actions, number of nearby users, function of space, equipment located in space, and space use policy) and developed a user-specific activity pattern generation (UAPG) framework consisting of three stages: (1) the preparation stage, (2) sensor-estimation stage, and (3) activity pattern generation stage. The demonstration was conducted through scenario-based experiments in an academic office building. In the demonstration, the UAPG framework achieved 91.8% of activity recognition accuracy and successfully generated user-specific activity patterns. In addition, information regarding space usage, proportion of activities, and spatial preference of the user was generated based on a user-specific activity pattern. Such objective information provided by the UAPG framework enables evidence-based ABW planning that efficiently accommodates users with minimal office space, while simultaneously increasing their satisfaction and productivity.

C	Juj, K; Perera, C			IEEE	Juj, Karan; Perera, Charith			Exploring the Suitability of BLE Beacons to Track Poacher Vehicles in Harsh Jungle Terrains	2020 IEEE 6TH WORLD FORUM ON INTERNET OF THINGS (WF-IOT)			English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE Virtual World Forum on Internet of Things (IEEE WF-IoT)	JUN 02-16, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Internet Things, IEEE Commun Soc, IEEE Signal Proc, IEEE Council Elect Design Automat, IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Control Syst Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE MTT S, IEEE Elect Devices Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc			SYSTEM	Our overall aim is focused on exploring whether we could use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to track poacher vehicles in remote and rural areas such as Sabah, in Malaysia, especially deep inside the jungle terrain with little or no communication technologies exists. Tracking technologies are currently limited to relying on satellites or cellular-towers for environments that do not permit access to these signals, very few viable alternatives exist. This paper explores the use of BLE as a method to track vehicles. It works by mounting Bluetooth beacons beside a road and placing a receiver concealed somewhere inside the vehicle. As the vehicle drives past the beacon, the receiver and beacon are momentarily in range, the receiver then stores a unique ID from the beacon, and when the vehicle is then in an area with GSM signal, an SMS is sent containing the unique IDs of the beacons that have been detected. This project is prototyped and tested in collaboration with the Danau Girang Field Centre in Sabah, Malaysia. The results offer insights for how effective BLE beacons are in a tracking situation for where the beacon and receiver are in range for a short period of time as well as how different obstructions will affect the range and strength of the signal. It is important to note that our objective is not to catch the poacher, instead to understand how they move around within jungle terrain, as we can use such information to develop a comprehensive plan against poaching activities.

IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Industry 40; Internet of Things (IoT); localization; long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN); measurement error; position measurement; wearables		Nowadays, the flexible localization solution for various devices for workplace safety is one of the most demanding research questions. Notably, it is expected to provide an acceptable level of precision in different types of environments empowered by wearable technology and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Existing leading localization technologies are adapted for certain conditions, for example, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and ultra-wideband (UWB) are used for indoor areas and various global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based ones for outdoors. This work focuses on investigating the long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) (868-MHz band) as a potential candidate to bridge this gap, being one of the most reliable and recognized communication technologies for the Industrial IoT (IIoT). In the past, the research community had a lot of critics with respect to the applicability of LoRaWAN for localization, while the vision is facing tremendous change over the past two years. The purpose of this work is to assess the feasibility of LoRaWAN as a localization solution for work safety applications in the industrial scenario from different angles. The work is based on two measurement campaigns conducted at the Brno University of Technology (BUT), Brno, Czech Republic, and the University Politechnica of Bucharest (UPB), Bucharest, Romania. The campaigns cover both indoor and outdoor scenarios and provide the practical limitations of the positioning in standalone and ${k}$ -nearest neighbors ( ${k}$ -NN) powered localization systems. According to the results, LoRaWAN-based localization with relatively dense gateways (GWs) deployment allows for achieving a meter-level accuracy, which may be suitable for the localization of workers.

It has a potential to surpass conventional lab-based devices in terms of time, cost, accessibility, and even accuracy. This potential strongly depends on an availability of affordable and miniaturized electronic POC devices that can provide a fast and sensitive response. This paper presents an all-in-one electroanalytical device (AED) which is a cost-effective, field-ready, and miniaturized electronic POC device integrated with the most commonly used electroanalytical techniques such as amperometric, voltammetric, potentiometric, conductometric, and impedimetric techniques. The proposed AED can analyze multiple electrochemical sensors simultaneously while having a very small size of 48 mm x 37 mm, including eight disposable screen-printed electrochemical sensor (SPES) connectors. The device supports wired communication using a universal serial bus (USB) and wireless communication with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Furthermore, user-friendly customized Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed to control the device and send obtained data to the user. The system is evaluated through electrical tests to confirm the device accuracy. Subsequently, electrochemical experiments were conducted to evaluate device's performance in the field. These experiments indicated that the developed device operates as an electrochemical sensing device for POC applications. The proposed portable electroanalytical device can perform the most of electroanalytical methods in a single device which has very small form factor and capability to interpret multiple sensors at a time with user friendly interface.

Smart home power management system for electric vehicle battery charger and electrical appliance control	INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						electric vehicle; MQTT; power management system; smart home; wireless network		This article presents a power management system (PMS) designed for smart homes aiming to deal with the new challenges imposed by the proliferation of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) and their coexistence with other residential electrical appliances. The PMS is based on a hybrid wireless network architecture composed by a local hub/gateway and several Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi sensor/actuator devices. These wireless devices are used to transfer information inside the smart home using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Based on the proposed solution, the current consumption of the EV battery charger and other residential electrical appliances are dynamically monitored and controlled by using a configurable algorithm, ensuring that the total current consumption does not cause the tripping of the home circuit breaker. An Android client application allows the user to monitor and configure the system operation in real-time, a developed Wi-Fi smart plug permits to measure the RMS values of current of the connected electrical appliance and change its state of operation remotely, and an EV battery charger may be controlled in terms of operating power according to set-points received from the Android client application. Experimental tests are used to evaluate the quality of service provided by the developed smart home platform in terms of communication delay and reliability. An experimental validation for different conditions of operation of the proposed smart home PMS concerning the power operation of the EV battery charger with the proposed control algorithm is also presented.

In the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, they have gained even more attention. This remote and contactless distributed sensing technology enabled monitoring of vital signs in real-time. Many of the devices are battery powered, so appropriate management of available energy is crucial for lengthening autonomous operation time without affecting weight, size, maintenance requirement, and user acceptance. In this paper, we discuss energy consumption aspects of sensor data transmission using wireless Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Long Range (BLE-M-LR) technology. Papers in the field of energy savings in wireless networks do not directly address the problem of the dependence of the energy needed for transmission on the type and degree of data preprocessing, which is the novelty and uniqueness of this work. We built and studied a prototype system designed to work as a multimodal sensing node in a compound IoT application targeted to assisted living. To analyze multiple energy-related aspects, we tested it in various operation and data transmission modes: continuous, periodic, and event-based. We also implemented and tested two alternative sensor-side processing procedures: deterministic data stream reduction and neural network-based recognition and labeling of the states. Our results reveal that event-based or periodic operation allows the node for years-long operating, and the sensor-side processing may degrade the power economy more than it benefits from savings made on transmission of concise data.

J	Fernandes, B; Silva, F; Analide, C; Neves, J				Fernandes, Bruno; Silva, Fabio; Analide, Cesar; Neves, Jose			Crowd Sensing for Urban Security in Smart Cities	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Smart Cities; Crowd Sensing; Internet of People; Ambient Intelligence; Vulnerable Road Users; Smart Clothing		Upcoming cities must undoubtedly reason upon the knowledge they have acquired through data gathered by sensorization. Those who do that will be at the forefront, closing to become Smart Cities. To achieve this goal, we must evolve from an Internet of Things to an Internet of People, defined as an ecosystem where everyone and everything can sense the other and the world, and act upon such data and knowledge, aiming to enhance people's quality of life. Considering the Vulnerable Road Users' (VRUs) problem, this work provides a proof of concept on crowd sensing for urban security in Smart Cities, confirming that our concept is viable and has practical potential. The goal is to sense the density of people at certain points of interest for VRUs, such as pedestrian crossings or busier roads, by detecting Wi-Fi probe requests with a Smart Scanner. Such information can be relevant to many applications, allowing, for example, the promotion of better safety measures on crowed spots, enhance crowd control and assemble interesting insights on traffic characteristics. To complement this work, and considering that smart clothing will certainly play an important role in promoting the citizen sensor and the smart cities' approach to VRUs' safety, a case study will be presented and discussed in which their clothing is equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy transmitter.

To improve the linearity and reduce the switching power consumption, a segmented structure with new switching scheme is adopted in the capacitive digital-to-analog converter. The proposed switching sequence determines the MSBs according to the thermometer codes and skips some of the unnecessary steps while avoiding bubble errors. To ensure the common mode voltage remains comparatively steady, and to avoid employing power-hungry common mode reference voltage circuits, each capacitor is divided into 2 identical small capacitors, connecting one of them to high and the other one to low. The switching sequence is straightforward, and a split capacitor with an integer value is applied, which almost halves the total number of capacitors while retaining the unit capacitor value intact. The prototype analog-to-digital converter is fabricated and measured in a 55-nm (shrinked 65nm) complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process and achieves 5.48 to 5.92 Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) at a sampling frequency of 4MS/s. The Signal to Noise and Distortion Ratio (SNDR) and Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) for Nyquist input frequency are 34.79 and 40.03dB, respectively. The current consumption is 4.8A from a 1.0-V supply, which corresponds to the figure of merit of 26fJ/conversion-step. The total active area of the analog-to-digital converters for the I and Q paths of the receiver is 105 mu mx140 mu m.

Wireless mesh networks are a critical component to achieve this ubiquitous connectivity for a wide range of services, and are composed of terminal devices (i.e., nodes), such as sensors of various types, and wall powered gateway devices, which provide further internet connectivity (e.g., via Wi-Fi). When considering large indoor areas, such as hospitals or industrial scenarios, the mesh must cover a large area, which introduces concerns regarding range and the number of gateways needed and respective wall cabling infrastructure, including data and power. Solutions for mesh networks implemented over different wireless protocols exist, like the recent Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.1. While BLE provides lower power consumption, some wall-power infrastructure may still be required. Alternatively, if some nodes are battery powered, concerns such as lifetime and packet delivery are introduced. We evaluate a scenario where the intermediate nodes of the mesh are battery powered, using a BLE relay of our own design, which acts as a range extender by forwarding packets from end-nodes to gateways. We present the relay's design and experimentally determine the packet forwarding efficiency for several scenarios and configurations. In the best case, up to 35% of the packets transmitted by 11 end-nodes can be forwarded to a gateway by a single relay under continuous operation. A battery lifetime of 1 year can be achieved with a relay duty cycle of 20%.

As a response to the consistent increase in the number of people suffering from various diseases, the medical research is always looking for better diagnostic tools, expedited information transfer technologies, accurate prognosis devices, efficient patient management system and other alternative medicine strategies. In this context, the H2020 Project SINTEC proposes a soft intelligent epidermal communication platform where two main innovations are integrated: soft epidermal electronics and the intra-body communication based on fat tissue as a transmission channel. This proposed platform will host miniaturized, conformal and flexible sensing and data transfer technologies to enable real-time monitoring of certain vital parameters at any time (while doing sport, sleeping or watching television without having to go to a health specialized facility and/or using different devices such as a pulse oximetry, heart rate monitor and thermometer). As part of the phantom development, empirical models relating bioimpedance signals to other physiological signals (ECG, Sp02, Blood Pressure, etc.) is being studied and will be used to optimize phantom -based demonstrators as close as possible to human subjects. To this end, proper characterization of bioimpedance signals in different human subjects is crucial to devise such empirical models. This work presents preliminary results in four human volunteers, with different weight, gender and age, using two types of electrodes configurations. These results show that bioimpedance signals correlate well with volunteer's metadata as predicted by previous works. Finally, the communication through the FAT-channel and also comparisons with the traditional Freespace BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocol will be demonstrated.

The third version of the iBikE system consisted of a motorized bike and a tablet PC. It utilized conventional Bluetooth to implement remote control of the motorized bike's speed during an exercise session as well as to provide real-time visualization of the exercise progress. We developed three customized tablet PC apps with similar user interfaces but different communication protocols for all the platforms to provide a graphical representation of exercise progress. The same microcontroller unit (MCU), ESP-32, was used in all the systems.Results: Each system was tested in 1-minute exercise sessions at various speeds. To evaluate the accuracy of the measured data, in addition to reading speed values from the iBikE app, the cycling speed of the bikes was measured continuously using a tachometer. The mean differences of averaged RPMs for both data sets were calculated. The calculated values were 0.38 +/- 0.03, 0.25 +/- 0.27, and 6.7 +/- 3.3 for the BLE system, the Wi-Fi system, and the conventional Bluetooth system, respectively.Conclusion: All interfaces provided sufficient accuracy for use in telerehabilitation.

Nevertheless, in life sciences and other scientific domains, there often exists a need to develop advanced mobile apps that go beyond simple questionnaires: ranging from sensor data collection and processing to self-management tools for chronic patients in healthcare. We present Punya, an open source, web-based platform based on MIT App Inventor that simplifies building Linked Data-enabled, advanced mobile apps that exploit smartphone capabilities. We posit that its integration with Linked Data facilitates the development of complex application and business rules, communication with heterogeneous online services, and interaction with the Internet of Things (IoT) data sources using the smartphone hardware. To that end, Punya includes an embedded semantic rule engine, integration with GraphQL and SPARQL to access remote graph data, and support for IoT devices using Bluetooth Low Energy and Linked Data Platform Constrained Application Protocol (LDP-CoAP). Moreover, Punya supports generating Linked Data descriptions of collected data. The platform includes built-in tutorials to quickly build apps using these different technologies. In this paper, we present a short discussion of the Punya platform, its current adoption that includes over 500 active users as well as the larger app-building MIT App Inventor community of which it is a part, and future development directions that would greatly benefit Semantic Web and Linked Data application developers as well as researchers who leverage Linked Open Data resources for their research.

RTBioT: a real-time healthcare monitoring Bio-IoT device employing spatially resolved near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy	OPTICAL TOMOGRAPHY AND SPECTROSCOPY OF TISSUE XIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy of Tissue XIII	FEB 04-06, 2019	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Spatially resolved spectroscopy; real-time; Internet of Things; healthcare	OPTICAL-PROPERTIES	This paper describes RTBioT, one of the first Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare platforms based on spatially resolved near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to support non-invasively quantify chromophores in biological tissue. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is used as the primary communication protocol, an IR-enhanced Si PIN photodiode is for a light-receiving element, and a compact fiber-stub type beam combiner is employed as a multiple wavelengths light-emitting source. Most of all, a lock-in amplifier is to retrieve the low noise signal from photodiode which enables accurate measurement of small modulated signals in the presence of noise interference orders of magnitude greater than the signal amplitude by using phase-sensitive detection technique (PSD). The sampling rate of the RTBioT is up to 33Hz, so that it can directly measure mayer wave oscillation, respiration, and cardiac cycle from the raw data. However, it is necessary to approach to the statistical analysis to quantify the concentration of tissue chromophores. First, we determine the optical absorption and scattering properties in the tissue from the locked-in received signal by using the algorithm composed of least square method and diffusion equation. Then, inverse-matrix equation with absorption, reduced scattering and extinction coefficients is solved by the algorithm with respect to chromophores. We conducted an experiment through phantoms simulating human tissue and human subjects to demonstrate its feasibility for the IoT healthcare platform. The experimental results show that it is possible to monitor the biological signals and the concentrations of chromophores in a human subject in near real time fashion.

The system, VySys, includes two compact wearable wireless biosensor devices for continuous vital signs capturing and transmission, a gateway to relay the message collected from the biosensors to cloud, and finally a client apps to access and display the stored data in the cloud. Both biosensor devices can last for 24 hours and weigh less than 22 g and 44 g, respectively. They consistof proprietary in-housebio-sensing integrated circuit (IC) and commercial off-the-shelf Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. VySys has been deployed in clinical trials with 14 subjects. From the studies, the accuracy and advantage of VySys are evaluated and the five vital signs captured (heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), temperature (TMP), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and systolic blood pressure (SBP)) are benchmarked against a commercial medical-grade device.

Equipped with a four-coil inductive link, the EnerCage-HC2 system wirelessly powers the receiver (Rx) headstage, irrespective of the subject's location or head orientation, eliminating the need for tethering or carrying bulky batteries. On the transmitter (Tx) side, a driver coil, five high-quality (Q) factor segmented resonators at different heights and orientations, and a closed-loop Tx power controller create a homogeneous electromagnetic (EM) field within the homecage 3-D space, and compensate for drops in power transfer efficiency (PTE) due to Rx misalignments. The headstage is equipped with four small slanted resonators, each covering a range of head orientations with respect to the Tx resonators, which direct the EM field toward the load coil at the bottom of the headstage. Moreover, data links based on Wi-Fi, UART, and Bluetooth low energy are utilized to enables remote communication and control of the Rx. The PTE varies within 23.6%-33.3% and 6.7%-10.1% at headstage heights of 8 and 20 cm, respectively, while continuously delivering >40 mW to the Rx electronics even at 90 degrees rotation. As a proof of EnerCage-HC2 functionality in vivo, a previously documented on-demand electrical stimulation of the globus pallidus, eliciting consistent head rotation, is demonstrated in three freely behaving rats.

In this paper, an implantable LES stimulator with wireless power transmission is proposed for the treatment of GERD. The LES stimulator is composed of an implantable pulse generator (IPG), an external controller, and a wireless power transmission module. The IPG, whose area is 31x21 mm(2), is designed to generate voltage-regulated constant-current stimulation pulses. The external controller allows for wireless programming of the IPG via a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. The wireless power transmission module provides power for the IPG. According to the measurement of output stimulus waveforms, the proposed LES stimulator is capable of delivering electrical stimulations with a current ranging between 0 and 8 mA. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the proposed LES stimulator, experiments were performed on 12 male New Zealand white rabbits. Esophageal manometry was performed before and after the procedure and the LES pressure (LESP) has been recorded. The mean LESP is increased significantly in the stimulation group than the sham group (stimulation group: 9.25 +/- 1.24 mmHg vs 13.99 +/- 1.28 mmHg, p<0.05; sham group: 9.00 +/- 1.22 mmHg vs 9.23 +/- 1.27 mmHg, p=0.267). The results show that the electrical stimulation delivered by the LES stimulator can safely and effectively increase resting LES pressure in acute animal models, suggesting that the implantable LES stimulator is a perspective approach for treating GERD in clinics.

Taking advantage of the emerging concept of connected car, the popularity of smartphones and the rise of Internet of Things, this work proposes a solution to predict where the best available parking spots are. The proposal includes both a centralized system to predict empty indoor parking spaces based on cellular automata, and a low-cost mobile application based on different technologies to help the driver to find empty parking spaces. On the one hand, cellular automata are used to model the behavior of drivers in parking facilities. Specifically, the system applies the idea behind the game of life to capture some features of parking occupancy based on common user behaviors, in order to reduce the time to find empty parking spots. On the other hand, the proposal involves a smartphone application that uses accurate technologies for indoor positioning. The client software is a lightweight Android application that provides different indoor positioning solutions, such as precise positioning systems based on Quick Response codes or Near Field Communication tags, or semi-precise positioning systems based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The proposed service takes into account that it will be gradually adopted by users. The results obtained from a preliminary implementation show how the proposal improves the parking experience and increases efficiency of parking facilities in terms of time and energy costs.

The lack of high-resolution occupancy distribution in large spaces is often perceived as one of the main causes of underperformed HAVC systems. Current studies usually considered occupancy information of the whole space or room, such as occupancy count level, other than the zone-level occupancy distribution. Although the count of total occupants in space might stay constant, the actual occupancy distribution might be different, which will bring with different operations for each HVAC terminal. Therefore, to find out one high-resolution occupancy level, this research proposed the idea of integrating k-Means clustering and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification algorithm to detect the occupancy distribution via the dual Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi signal technology networks. One experiment place was conducted in one indoor area of the typical office room at the City University of Hong Kong for measuring the signal distribution of BLE and Wi-Fi. In this study, the occupancy preference cluster could be mapped into the indoor thermal zones and three case studies are chosen for validation of occupant number confirmation in each thermal zone. Finally, zone occupancy based energy performance analysis was presented with the assistance of wireless sensors nodes to compare energy saving potential under actual occupancy distribution and detected occupancy distribution and the importance of zone occupancy information for the demand-driven control mechanism is stressed.

We adopted the same hardware and methodology for measurements in both places, and paid particular attention to the impact of RSS on various environmental factors, such as LOS and NLOS scenarios and interference in 2.4 GHz band. In addition, we considered the receiver orientation and the different frequencies of BLE advertising channels. We show that snapshot RSS measurements typically have high variability, not easily explainable by classical path-loss models. A snapshot recording is defined here as one continuous recording at fixed device locations in a static setup. Our observations also show that aggregated RSS data (i.e., considering several snapshot measurements together) is more informative from a statistical point of view and more in agreement with current theoretical path-loss models than snapshot measurements. However, in BLE applications such as contact tracing and proximity detection, the receivers typically have access only to snapshot measurements (e.g., taken over a short duration of 10-20 minutes or less), so the accuracy of contact-tracing and proximity detection can be highly affected by RSS instabilities. In addition to presenting the measurement-based BLE RSS analysis in a comprehensive and well-documented format, our paper also emphasizes open challenges when BLE RSS is used for contact tracing, ranging, and positioning applications.

It has a wide deployment base (i.e., on smartphones), has peer discovery as an inherent protocol feature, does not require infrastructure (e.g., satellites or base stations) to operate, and sparingly uses energy that is good for extended monitoring. In this paper, we show that we can use the BLE peer discovery capability on smartphones to detect and monitor massive and dynamic encounters, which would provide valuable insights into many epidemiological or sociological phenomena. However, being designed for more leisurely interactions, BLE needs some stretching in order to be used in large-scale operations. Specifically, the protocol design is not optimal to rapidly discover hundreds of devices in the communication range, whereas dense crowds and mass gatherings are not unrealistic in city life. Moreover, if the crowd is dynamic, discovery becomes even more time-pressed because encounters should be recorded before churn. In this paper, we push the BLE technology with the requirements to discover hundreds of devices before co-presence expires, and to work continually over a typical smartphone charge cycle. Specifically, we investigate how we should modify the BLE protocol and how we should set its protocol parameters for this purpose. We show that with the proposed changes and configurations, we can accelerate the speed of discovery for massive and dynamic crowds by more than an order of magnitude compared to the case that we naively follow the guidance of the current BLE standard.

Kansas City, MO	IEEE		Crowd Management; BLE; IoT; RSSI		Human casualties at entertaining, religious, or political events often occur due to lack of proper crowd management. Notably, for the crowd in mobile, a minor accident can create a panic for the people to start stampeding and trampling others. Although many smart video surveillance technologies are recently proposed, it is still very challenging problems to predict a crash in real-time among the mobile crowd for preventing any potential disaster. In this paper, we propose CROMO that enhances crowd mobility characterization through real-time Radio Frequency (RF) data analytics. Inspired by the recent advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning (ML) algorithms, traditional video surveillance technologies make object detection and identification possible in real-time. However, their scalability and capacity lack in a crowded mobile environment. CROMO propose to fill the gap via RF signal analytics. Among the many crowd mobility characteristics, we tackle object group identification, the speed, and direction detection for the mobile group. We also apply them to group semantics to track the crowd status and predict any potential accidents and disasters. Taking advantage of power-efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ubiquitous availability, we specifically analyze a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. We have tested CROMO in both a practical crowd event and the controlled indoor and outdoor lab environments. The results show that CROMO can detect the direction, the speed, and the density of the mobile crowd in real-time. Therefore, it can help the crowd management in avoiding disasters possibilities at crowd events.

PSM-DMO: Power Save Mode and Discontinuous BLE Mesh Operation	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Bluetooth; BLE; Energy; Power saving; Bluetooth mesh; Wireless mesh networks	NETWORKS; INTERNET; THINGS	The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh profile, standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), has an increasing interest in IoT solutions. However, the standard assumes that relay and friend nodes should be continuously scanning the channel awaiting any incoming transmissions. This could be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, particularly in application scenarios where the backbone of the mesh network cannot be powered and traffic is infrequent. Hence, we present a novel strategy, named PSM-DMO, that minimizes the scan periods and thus, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption of the mesh network. PSM-DMO is defined as a new and optional feature for the currently published BLE mesh specifications, coexists with the standard operation, and is implemented without modifying the core of the specification. The proposal, that ensures the reliability of the mesh operation, can be used in BLE sensor networks that can tolerate a certain transmission delay. PSM-DMO replaces the continuous scan by a periodic but asynchronous polling process whereby the relay and sink nodes interrogate their neighbors about the existence of data to receive or to retransmit through the network. Nodes only go into scan mode during the period of time the mesh network will be involved in the transmission and dissemination. This period is estimated by the node which is the source of data, it is announced to its neighbors and it is propagated consecutively by all the relay nodes until the desti-nation. PSM-DMO allows a theoretical reduction in the energy consumption of relay nodes up to 99.24 %.

J	Lee, BG; Lee, SM				Lee, Boon Giin; Lee, Su Min			Smart Wearable Hand Device for Sign Language Interpretation System With Sensors Fusion	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Gesture recognition; machine learning; mobile application; sign language recognition; wearable computing	GESTURE RECOGNITION; GLOVE	Gesturing is an instinctive way of communicating to present a specific meaning or intent. Therefore, research into sign language interpretation using gestures has been explored progressively during recent decades to serve as an auxiliary tool for deaf and mute people to blend into society without barriers. In this paper, a smart sign language interpretation system using a wearable hand device is proposed to meet this purpose. This wearable system utilizes five flex-sensors, two pressure sensors, and a three-axis inertial motion sensor to distinguish the characters in the American sign language alphabet. The entire system mainly consists of three modules: 1) a wearable device with a sensor module; 2) a processing module; and 3) a display unit mobile application module. Sensor data are collected and analyzed using a built-in embedded support vector machine classifier. Subsequently, the recognized alphabet is further transmitted to a mobile device through Bluetooth low energy wireless communication. An Android-based mobile application was developed with a text-to-speech function that converts the received textinto audible voice output. Experiment results indicate that a true sign language recognition accuracy rate of 65.7% can be achieved on average in the first version without pressure sensors. A second version of the proposed wearable system with the fusion of pressure sensors on the middle finger increased the recognition accuracy rate dramatically to 98.2%. The proposed wearable system outperforms the existing method, for instance, although background lights, and other factors are crucial to a vision-based processing method, they are not for the proposed system.

However, in these techniques, data collection and analysis still remain manual. Remotely locating workers on site has been suggested as a potential technology to collect crucial data required for production control. The purpose of this study is to test the applicability of a real-time tracking system for collecting data for production control in different types of construction projects. We applied Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in real-time tracking of workers in three case projects, including residential, office building, and plumbing renovation. We compared various tracking device placement strategies and analyzed the share of uninterrupted presence of workers in work locations based on the collected data. The findings show that both location-based and time-based information of workers can be obtained in real time from the proposed system, but issues of accuracy and coverage need to be considered when defining the data collection plan for each project. Accuracy and coverage issues can be resolved to a significant degree by applying heuristics in data analysis rather than investing in a more sophisticated tracking technology. The conclusion is that real-time tracking technologies are ready for implementation when certain heuristics and guidelines for installation are followed. It is possible to calculate a real-time presence index on a construction site. These data could be used to evaluate the impact of construction management interventions on waste on-site.

An Embedded System for Acoustic Data Processing and AI-Based Real-Time Classification for Road Surface Analysis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Roads; Rough surfaces; Surface roughness; Tires; Real-time systems; Surface cracks; Convolutional neural networks; Road surface classification; convolutional neural network; audio processing; embedded system; image recognition	NOISE	The current roadway monitoring is expensive and not systematic. This paper proposes a new system able to evaluate the pavement quality of road infrastructure. The embedded system records and processes the acoustic data of the wheel-road interaction and classifies in real-time roadways' health thanks to integrated AI solutions. The measurements to produce the dataset to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) were collected using a vehicle operating at different cruise speeds in the area of Pisa. The dataset is composed by acoustic data belonging to several typologies of roads: dirty or grass roads, high roughness surfaces and roads with cracks or potholes. The raw audio signals were split, labelled, and converted into images by calculating the Mel spectrogram. Finally, the authors designed a tiny CNN with a size equal to 18 kB able to classify between four different classes: good quality road, ruined road, silence and unknown. The CNN architecture achieves an accuracy of about 93% on the original model and 90% on the quantized one. Quantization permits to convert the final architecture into a suitable form to be deployed on a low-complex embedded system integrated in the tyre cavity. In addition, a custom board was designed to act as IoT node thanks to a Bluetooth Low Energy communication towards smartphones and/or car infotainment systems. These systems, featured with GPS, guarantee to obtain real-time maps service of road quality. At authors' knowledge, this is the first real-time and fully integrated solution at the state of the art for road pavement quality analysis and classification on acoustic data.

By adopting low-profile electromechanical actuators and a compact printed circuit board design, this lightweight device can be worn directly on the occlusive cuff, therefore eliminating the need of a long and obtrusive tubing interconnect between the device and the cuff, as seen in traditional ambulatory BP monitors (ABPM). Instead of executing the BP estimation algorithm directly on the device, the proposed design rather sends the raw oscillometric signal through a Bluetooth Low Energy link, thus granting any Bluetooth-enabled device to gather and process the signal using a dedicated application. This in turn allows to assess several BP estimation algorithms found in the literature without being limited by the device resources. Three of them were tested with the designed prototype and validated with a reference equipment on 11 subjects. Overall, two of the algorithms revealed a mean absolute difference with the reference equipment of less than 5 mmHg and almost zero bias along with a standard deviation of less than 6 mmHg. Reproducibility results shown a mean difference between successive measurements of less than 3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation of less than 2.4 mmHg. The assembled prototype dimensions are 63.8 x 134.8 x 24.8 mm and features an autonomy of 63.1 hours. Comparison with commercial ABPM devices shown that the proposed design is 18% to 33% smaller volume-wise, 5% to 27% weight-wise and height is reduced by 17% to 25%.

Performance of first pacemaker to use smart device app for remote monitoring	HEART RHYTHM O2			English	Article						Digital health; Pacemaker; Remote monitoring; Smart devices; Telemedicine		(PM) patients improves outcomes; however, adherence remains suboptimal. Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) technology in newergeneration PMs enables communication directly with patient-owned smart devices using an app without a bedside console. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the success rate of scheduled RM transmissions using the app compared to other RM methods. METHODS The BlueSync Field Evaluation was a prospective, international cohort evaluation, measuring the success rate of scheduled RM transmissions using a BLE PM or cardiac resynchronization therapy PM coupled with the MyCareLink Heart app. App transmission success was compared to 3 historical "control" groups from the Medtronic deidentified CareLink database: (1) PM patients with manual communication using a wand with a bedside console (PMmanual transmission), (2) PM patients with wireless automatic communication with the bedside console (PM wireless); (3) defibrillator patients with similar automatic communication (defibrillator wireless). RESULTS Among 245 patients enrolled (age 64.8 +/- 15.6 years, 58.4% men), 953 transmissions were scheduled through 12 months, of which 902 (94.6%) were successfully completed. In comparison, transmission success rates were 56.3% for PM manual transmission patients, 77.0% for PM wireless patients, and 87.1% for defibrillator wireless patients. Transmission successwith the appwas superior across matched cohorts based on age, sex, and device type (single vs dual vs triple chamber). CONCLUSION The success rate of scheduled RM transmissions was higher among patients using the smart device app compared to patients using traditional RM using bedside consoles. This novel technology may improve patient engagement and adherence to RM.

The PA operates in linear mode (class-AB) for variable-envelope modulated signals and switching mode (class-F) for constant-envelope modulated signals. The proposed linear mode PA design is suitable for multi-band LTE, IOT, WSN and multi-standard RF transmitter, while switching mode PA design can be used in multi-band IOT-LPWA and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) RF transmitter. The proposed PA has a reconfigurable off-chip inter-stage and output matching networks over the specified frequency band, while the input stage is Complementary Current-Reuse common-gate with active shunt feedback configuration to achieve Ultra-Wideband (UWB) input matching. The proposed multi-mode PA is designed using a 130 nm CMOS process. Class-AB PA has a saturated output power of 23.5 dBm +/- 1 dB over 0.1-4.2 GHz, a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 41%, a third-order intercept point (OIP3) of 17 dBm, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of - 29.3 dBc for LTE 15 MHz channel bandwidth.

The system should allow the monitoring of combustion engines usage, detect faults remotely, and is focused on IC engines for maritime applications. It consists of two parts, as explained in the following. The first part involves the development of the device, which should be capable of performing a continuous monitoring of an engine's activity and register its working periods. This decision is made based on the vibration analysis. As a requirement, the developed device must be low-cost, portable and have a low energy consumption to provide at least two years of autonomy. The second part involves fault's detection and, like the first part, it requires information from the engine's vibrations. A low power accelerometer will be used to monitor the engine's activity, and a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride film is used to record the engine's vibration, for fault detection. The data is then sent via Bluetooth to the user's smartphone, which forwards it to the Internet, for further analysis. Bluetooth Low Energy is used to support the required autonomy. The developed technique for fault detection includes data acquisition, analog and digital pre-processing and digital processing. The most important part of the digital processing, in this case, is a Time-Frequency Analysis. Several Time-Frequency Analysis algorithms were tested with real data to select the best solution to detect faults in such engines.

Social safety distance is one of the most effective strategies to stop the spreading of the virus, as it reduces the dose of infectious particles that a person can receive. Real-time location systems (RTLS) based on ultrawideband (UWB), radio frequency identification (RFID), Global Position System (GPS), or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can help keep workers safe at the workplace. The aim of the current paper is to develop a dosimeter proposal to monitor and control the distance and exposure time between workers based on BLE beacon technology considering viral load. Our proposal is based on a set of BLE beacons and safety distance estimation by filtering RSSI measurements with a Gaussian extended Kalman filter. According to the estimated proximity values and the exposure time, a finite state machine will alarm when the worker receives the maximum dose defined by health authorities. The proposed system can be applied to prevent any risk that can be eliminated or reduced controlling distances and/or exposition time of the worker to the occupational risk. The proposal is robust, is inexpensive, and respects the privacy of workers, and its accuracy is higher than that of existing smartphone applications. In future pandemic situations, the system can be easily updated to the safety distance and viral particle dose related with the new risk agent. The system can protect from additional risk incorporating beacons on the extra risk identified such as thermal, noise, or radiation.

Accordingly, this paper aims to propose a framework of a smart system using the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and digital twin (DT) technologies to realize real-time occupational safety monitoring in the warehouse and ensure synchronized cyber-physical spaces for information traceability and visibility. The unsupervised deep neural structure of stacked auto-encoder (SAE) is designed to identify abnormal stationary from human motion status, which is perceived as a sign of potential accident. The model is developed to automatically update online by cooperating with calibration samples so as to keep in accordance with the evolution of surroundings. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a log-distance path loss model are used to fulfill indoor localization in order for managers to promptly respond to an incident on site. Besides, some intelligent services are enabled to promote the efficiency of safety management. A real-life case study is carried out in an air cargo cold storage warehouse to illustrate the viability and rationality of the proposed system and methods. The elaboration of the implementation is envisioned to facilitate replication and reproduction effectively. The impact of learning features concerned with distance and vibration on the perfor-mance of anomaly detection has also been analyzed by experiments. The insights and lessons gained in this study hold the promise of providing a reference or sparking new ideas for researchers and practitioners to meet similar needs in practice.

RSSs exhibit significant random variations in both the spatial and temporal domains. It is a notoriously onerous and challenging task to construct the fingerprint database for accurate localization, as the BLE RSSs must be captured via a full space scan from one point to another every few meters in a certain period of time. In order to tackle this problem, this study proposes an approach to fast fingerprints construction that only requires a sparse sampling of RSS of the space. First, a smartphone records the time series of RSS over a designated path, and a radio map for the path is then generated by a spatio-temporal mapping method using the Pedestrian Dead Reckoning algorithm. Second, the radio map of the entire space can be obtained via Gauss Process Regression (GPR), with outliers reduced to improve the reliability of the fingerprint database. Experiments have been performed in an underground carpark (38 m x14 m), and the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can construct the fingerprint database 300% faster than the conventional approach does. The localization accuracy of both approaches is quite similar (80% error in 2.8 m). The proposed approach offers potential for the construction of a large-scale fingerprint database for a wide-area Location Based Service (LBS) of Smart City indoor and outdoor integration, where big RSS data processing is a must.

Since these cameras acquire and process sensitive and vulnerable data in applications such as surveillance or monitoring, security is essential to avoid cyberattacks. However, cameras on mobile devices have constraints in size, computation and power consumption, so that lightweight security techniques should be considered. Camera identification techniques guarantee the origin of the data. Among the camera identification techniques, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) allow generating unique, distinctive and unpredictable identifiers from the hardware of a device. PUFs are also very suitable to obfuscate secret keys (by binding them to the hardware of the device) and generate random sequences (employed as nonces). In this work, we propose a trusted camera based on PUFs and standard cryptographic algorithms. In addition, a protocol is proposed to protect the communication with the trusted camera, which satisfies authentication, confidentiality, integrity and freshness in the data communication. This is particularly interesting to carry out camera control actions and firmware updates. PUFs from Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs) are selected because cameras typically include SRAMs in its hardware. Therefore, additional hardware is not required and security techniques can be implemented at low cost. Experimental results are shown to prove how the proposed solution can be implemented with the SRAM of commercial Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chips included in the communication module of the camera. A proof of concept shows that the proposed solution can be implemented in low-cost cameras.

Self-Localization via Circular Bluetooth 5.1 Antenna Array Receiver	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						BLE; bluetooth; wireless sensor networks; angle-of-arrival; signal processing; Internet of Things; self-localization; RTLS; IPS	DIRECTION-OF-ARRIVAL; DOA ESTIMATION; HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION; ALGORITHM; LOCATION; ESPRIT	Future telecommunications aim to be ubiquitous and efficient, as widely deployed connectivity will allow for a variety of edge/fog based services. Challenges are numerous, e.g., spectrum overuse, energy efficiency, latency and bandwidth, battery life and computing power of edge devices. Addressing these challenges is key to compose the backbone for the future Internet-of-Things (IoT). Among IoT applications are Indoor Positioning System and indoor Real-Time-Location-Systems systems, which are needed where GPS is unviable. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.1 specification introduced Direction Finding to the protocol, allowing for BLE devices with antenna arrays to derive the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of transmissions. Well known algorithms for AoA calculation are computationally demanding, so recent works have addressed this, since the low-cost of BLE devices may provide efficient solutions for indoor localization. In this paper, we present a system topology and algorithms for self-localization where a receiver with an antenna array utilizes the AoAs from fixed battery powered beacons to self-localize, without a centralized system or wall-power infrastructure. We conduct two main experiments using a BLE receiver of our own design. Firstly, we validate the expected behaviour in an anechoic chamber, computing the AoA with an RMSE of 10.7 degrees conduct a test in an outdoor area of 12 by 12 meters using four beacons, and present pre-processing steps prior to computing the AoAs, followed by position estimations achieving a mean absolute error of 3.6 m for 21 map positions, with a minimum as low as 1.1 m.

Multi-level buildings with an atrium space structure mainly consist of shopping malls and hospital outpatient buildings. This kind of building is widely spread, and they usually have a lot of people and a high demand for location-based services. The specific spatial structure of the indoor atrium makes the propagation of wireless signals different, which leads to most of the wireless signal-based floor positioning methods not working well in such an environment. Aiming at this atrium structure environment, this paper proposes a high-precision multi-method adaptive weighted fusion algorithm based on Bluetooth Low Energy signals. In experiments, the real-time dynamic floor positioning accuracy reached 92.7%, while the floor positioning accuracy in the 5-s static state was as high as 100%. Besides, when using 3 s of test data rolled back, real-time effects could also be achieved, with an accuracy of 98.3%. This method can be used alone for real-time floor positioning, it is suitable for wireless fidelity signals, and it can provide a highly accurate initial floor reference for barometric or inertial methods. It could also be integrated with other methods to provide highly accurate floor locations for long periods of time. The fingerprint library acquisition in this method saves time and effort. The database volume is small and generalizable to a wide range of applications.

Among LBS technologies, we used the Bluetooth low energy beacon in our system, which consumes less energy and is embedded in many current smartphones and tablets. In particular, the fingerprinting method has become a prime choice in the design of IPS owing to its good location estimation and the fact that a line-of-sight from access points is not required. We propose an improved two-step fingerprinting localization using multiple fingerprint features to enhance the localization accuracy. The proposed system uses a propagation model to convert RSS of beacons to distance and estimate the weighted centroid (WC) of nearby beacons. The estimated WCs along with signal strength and rank of the nearby beacons are stored in the server database for localization instead of RSS from all the deployed beacons. First, the proposed system makes use of diverse fingerprinting features to increase localization accuracy that also reduces both the physical size of the database and the amount of data communication with the server in the execution phase; second, affinity propagation clustering minimizes the searching space of RPs and reduces the computational cost; third, exponential averaging is introduced to smooth the noisy RSS. The experimental results obtained by real field deployment show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the positioning system in both the positioning accuracy and radio-map database size.

In this regard, ground landing stations (GLS) systems play a central role to increase the time and area coverage of UAV missions. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) techniques have been proposed for target location during UAV landing. However, these RSSI-based techniques present a lack of precision due to the propagation medium characteristics, which leads to UAV position vagueness. In this sense, the development of a novel low-cost GLS system for UAV tracking and landing is proposed. The GLS system has been embodied for the purpose of testing the UAV landing navigation capability. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) algorithm is addressed on an embedded microcontroller for the position estimation based on the RSSI acquired from an array of BLE devices. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the ground landing station system, achieving average errors of less than 0.04 m with the UAV-MLE target position estimation approach. This 0.04 m distance represents an order of magnitude increase in location precision over other currently available solutions. In many cases, this increased precision can enable more innovative docking mechanisms, less likelihood of mishaps in docking, and also quicker docking. It may also facilitate docking procedures where the docking station is itself moving, which may be the case if the docking unit is a mobile ground rover.

C	Lv, JM; Dong, W; Gao, Y; Chen, C			IEEE Comp Soc	Lv, Jiamei; Dong, Wei; Gao, Yi; Chen, Chun			Performant TCP over BLE	2022 IEEE 30TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORK PROTOCOLS (ICNP 2022)	IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	30th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 30-NOV 02, 2022	Univ Kentucky, Comp Sci Dept, Lexington, KY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Kentucky	Univ Kentucky, Comp Sci Dept			Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has gained large popularity as an important infrastructure of Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, researchers have integrated the TCP/IP stack with the BLE stack for interoperability, supporting more upper-layer protocols and applications. However, these works gain extremely low TCP goodput due to connection event inefficiency when TCP cooperates with BLE. How to improve the performance is an urgent problem. This paper proposes TCPle, a performant TCP-over-BLE stack that presents a novel adaption layer design bridging the gap between TCP and BLE without violating their specifications. TCPle improves the efficiency of connection events significantly by two fundamental mechanisms: connection event length adaption and connection event maintenance which correspond to the two root causes of low goodput. The connection event length adaption mechanism predicts the data size to send based on an online learning method and updates the connection event capacity adaptively. This mechanism avoids the long waiting time of ACK to back to the TCP sender. The connection event maintenance mechanism prefetches data packets to maintain the connection event. This mechanism avoids the long waiting time of data packets when out of the sender after the ACK is back. We implemented TCPle on nRF52840 DK with RIOT OS based on lwIP stack and NimBLE stack and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Results show that TCPle 1) is lightweight and well-suited for resource-constrained IoT devices; 2) improves TCP goodput by up to 101.6% compared with other existing TCP-over-BLE stacks.

However, there is a lack of an objective method to measure actual hours of brace usage. The aim was to develop a functional prototype of a SMART (Sensor-integrated for Monitoring And Remote Tracking) clubfoot brace to record accurate brace usage and transmit the data remotely to healthcare providers treating clubfoot. Methods A collaborative team of engineers and doctors was formed to investigate various types of sensors and wireless technologies to develop a functional prototype of a SMART brace. Results Infrared sensors were used to detect if the feet were placed inside the shoes and magnetic Hall effect sensors to detect that the shoes were latched on to the bar of the existing FAB. Brace usage data were captured by the sensors every 15 minutes and stored locally on a data card. A Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based wireless transmission system was used to send the data daily from the brace to the remote cloud server via a smartphone application. Accurate brace usage data could be recorded by the sensors and visualized in real time on a web-based application in a pre-clinical setting, demonstrating feasibility in clinical practice. Conclusion The low-cost SMART brace prototype that we have developed can accurately measure and remotely transmit brace usage data and has the potential to transform caregivers' behaviour towards brace adherence, which could result in a tangible reduction in recurrence rates.

Within the SSI model, a digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a secure and trusted manner. At present, the existing SSI solutions rely on the Internet connection for carrying out the necessary operations such as messaging and credential verification. However, there are many places the Internet may not be accessible and other means for communication is needed. The objective of this paper is to design a proof-of-concept that would allow for secure, trustworthy, and decentralized peer-topeer communication without the need for any external networking infrastructure. For this, we investigate a particular case involving DIDComm and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We identify requirements for the architecture and propose an architectural framework that allows two entities to securely communicate and exchange verifiable credentials. Furthermore, we look at a specific use case, namely, how offline access control can be enabled within SSI between two mobile devices. We present and evaluate the implementation of offline access control system based on the proposed architecture. Through this research, and experimentation we can conclude that this approach has the potential to enable a wide range of interesting use cases and can be integrated into existing digital identity wallet solutions to extend the capabilities of offline messaging in a secure and decentralized manner that goes beyond the current models that rely on the Internet connectivity.

With an average of more than 6.5 devices per person, a plethora of applications are being developed especially related to healthcare. Although, current edge devices such as smartphone and smartwatch are becoming increasingly more powerful and more affordable, there are certain tasks such as those involving machine learning that require higher computational resources, thereby resulting in higher energy consumption in the case of edge devices. Offloading tasks to co-located edge nodes such as fog (a cloud-like localized, smaller resource pool), or a femto-cloud (integration of multiple edge nodes) is one viable solution to address the issues such as performing compute-intensive tasks, and managing energy consumption. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and becoming a pandemic has also made a case for edge computing (involving smartphone, wearables, health sensors) for the detection of symptoms to quarantine potential carriers of the virus. We focus on how various forms of smart and opportunistic healthcare (oHealth) can be provided by leveraging edge computing that makes use of a machine learning-based approach. We apply k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector classification (SVC) algorithms on real data trace for the healthcare and safety-related scenarios we considered. The empirical results obtained provide useful insights into machine learning-based task offloading in edge computing.

In hospitals, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) Beacon, indoor messaging system, and similar methods have generally been used for tracking, with Wi-Fi and BLE being the most common. Recently, nurses are increasingly using mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, while shifting. The accuracy when using WiFi or BLE may be affected by interference or multipath propagation. In this research, we evaluated the positioning accuracy of geomagnetic indoor positioning in hospitals. Materials and Methods: We compared the position measurement accuracy of a geomagnetic method alone, Wi-Fi alone, BLE beacons alone, geomagnetic plus Wi-Fi, and geomagnetic plus BLE in a general inpatient ward, using a geomagnetic positioning algorithm by GiPStech. The existing Wi-Fi infrastructure was used, and 20 additional BLE beacons were installed. Our first experiment compared these methods' accuracy for 8 test routes, while the second experiment verified a combined geomagnetic/BLE beacon method using 3 routes based on actual daily activities. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that the most accurate method was geomagnetic/BLE, followed by geomagnetic/Wi-Fi, and then geomagnetic alone. Discussion: The geomagnetic method's positioning accuracy varied widely, but combining it with BLE beacons reduced the average position error to approximately 1.2 m, and the positioning accuracy could be improved further. We believe this could effectively target humans (patients) where errors of up to 3 m can generally be tolerated. Conclusion: In conjunction with BLE beacons, geomagnetic positioning could be sufficiently effective for many in-hospital localization tasks.

J	Liu, JC; Feng, ZK; Mannan, A; Yang, LY				Liu, Jincheng; Feng, Zhongke; Mannan, Abdul; Yang, Liyan			Positioning of coordinates and precision analysis of sample trees using the intelligent forest survey calculator	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Forestry; Intelligent forest-survey calculator; Locations of sample trees; 3D coordinates; Accuracy analysis		Sample trees have great significance for extracting forest parameters and realizing well-targeted forestry operations. Accordingly, determining the precise position and coordinates of the sample trees is of special importance. In this paper, a new type of portable electronic instrument with high precision, the Intelligent Forest Survey Calculator (IFSC), is introduced. For the instrument, we have developed guidelines and explained the principles and methods for surveying locations of sample trees in fixed plots during forest survey. The instrument was set up at a starting site near the center of a fixed sample plot, and different sites were observed according to the distribution and density of sample trees. The instrument can also determine the coordinates of the sample trees using an integrated angle and distance measurement device on the basis of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) data transfer. The measurement precision influenced by both the stability of the instrument and environmental changes within the investigated area. To verify and analyze the interior and exterior adherence accuracy of the 3D coordinates produced by the IFSC, we conducted experments on 20 x 20 m fixed plots in Beijing Songshan National Nature Reserve. The errors of planar positioning (X and Y directions) were 0.0572 and 0.0561 m respectively, and the error of height (Z direction) was 0.0643 m. Our data therefore demonstrate that the IFSC has high precision in measuring the position coordinates of the sample trees, and can provide accurate data that can meet the requirements of practical forest surveys.

In this work, we present a wearable device for physical and emotional health monitoring. The device obtains user's key physiological signals: ECG, respiration, Impedance Cardiogram (ICG), blood pressure and skin conductance and derives the user's emotion states as well. We have developed embedded algorithms that process the bio-signals in real-time to detect any abnormalities (cardiac arrhythmias and morphology changes) in the ECG and to detect key parameters (such as the Pre- Ejection Period and fluid status level) from the ICG. We present a novel method to detect continuous beat-by-beat blood pressure from the ECG and ICG signals, as well as a real-time embedded emotion classifier that computes the emotion levels of the user Emotions are classified according to their attractiveness (positive valence) or their averseness (negative valence) in the horizontal valence dimension. The excitement level induced by the emotions is represented by high to low positions in the vertical arousal dimension of the valence-arousal space. The signals are measured either intermittently by touching the metal electrodes on the device (for point-of-care testing) or continuously, using a chest strap for long term monitoring.

These two factors have increased the rise of chronic diseases and have led to uneven distribution of medical resources as well as the emergence of basic health care demands in emerging markets. Looking forth to the future, it is projected that telecare will become a major means of coping with such issues. According to forecasts by various research institutes, the global telecare market is expected to see an annual 20% growth rate over the coming years. In Gartner's Hype Cycle for Telemedicine, 2010 Report, mobile health monitoring and home health monitoring are listed as highly anticipated health care applications for the future and which will require advanced integration of information and communication technologies. The medical electronics industry has been booming in recent years. With the maturation of wireless LAN (Local Area Network), Bluetooth low energy, and ZigBee technologies, it is projected that medical electronic devices will see further development in wireless connectivity, thereby providing dedicated, stable, and low-cost telecare services for the people. With its strong infrastructure and technological capability, the Taiwanese ICT industry is expected to provide ideal support for the development of telecare. Due to the vigorous involvement of the government and the industry, it is forecasted that the Taiwanese telecare industry will reach approximately US$18 billion in 2015. This speech will analyze the global development trends of telecare and address the applications, opportunities, and future outlook for the biomedical electronics and related industries in Taiwan.

With an internet of things (IoT) system and a cloud database, the stethoscope can be used in hospitals and telemedicine. The proposed stethoscope includes three parts, a front-end device for ECG and heart sound measurement, a smart device's APP and a cloud server. The ECG-measuring device is designed for single lead measurement and it has low power consumption as well as IoT-based design, which can send the real-time ECG data to the smart device's APP. On the other hand, the heart-sound-measuring device keeps the traditional stethoscope head, in order to ensure doctors can be used to the heart sound signal from this proposed stethoscope. Furthermore, it is attached an analog front-end circuit and a microphone, to filter the environmental noise and record the sound signal. At the end, the heart sound signal will be transmitted to the APP through the module of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The APP on smart device can display the synchronized and real-time signals including ECG and heart sound. Meanwhile, those signals will be recorded in smart devices and uploaded to the cloud server, where doctors and users can further monitor the data. The cloud server can not only store the past signals, but also realize telemedicine through the web user interface. The proposed intelligent stethoscope has been conducted human trials in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital.

The services were provided for both patients and health professionals. Methods: The pilot services were implemented to enhance healthcare service quality, improve patient safety, and provide an effective business process to health professionals in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. The services to enhance healthcare service quality include healing tours, cancer information/education, psychological assessments, indoor navigation, and exercise volume checking. The services to improve patient safety are monitoring of high-risk inpatients and delivery of real-time health information in emergency situations. In addition, the services to provide an effective business process to health professionals include surveys and web services for patient management. Results: Considering the sustainability of the pilot services, we decided to pause navigation and patient monitoring services until the interference problem could be completely resolved because beacon signal interference significantly influences the quality of services. On the other hand, we had to continue to provide new wearable beacons to high-risk patients because of hygiene issues, so the cost increased over time and was much higher than expected. Conclusions: To make the smart connected hospital services sustainable, technical feasibility (e.g., beacon signal interference), economic feasibility (e.g., continuous provision of new necklace beacons), and organizational commitment and support (e.g., renewal of new alternative medical devices and infrastructure) are required.

Development and Testing of EyeRemember: A Memory Aid App for Wearables for People with Brain Injury	COMPUTERS HELPING PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, ICCHP 2018, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs (ICCHP)	JUL 11-13, 2018	Univ Linz, Linz, AUSTRIA		Univ Linz	Assistive technology; Brain injury; Memory	COGNITIVE REHABILITATION; ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY	EyeRemember is a mobile app designed to run on wearable electronic devices and serve as an external memory aid for people with brain injury (BI). EyeRemember allows users to voice-record information about family, friends and caregivers (referred to as `contacts' in the app). The technology detects the presence of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons carried by the user's contacts and reminds users of the recorded information when contacts are present. EyeRemember was first developed for Google Glass and later for Android Wear smart-watches. Both versions were developed in accordance with user-centered design principles, by including end-users and identifying their needs, wants and limitations throughout the design process. This paper describes the features and functionality of EyeRemember, its interaction with BLE beacons and the implementation of the user-centered design process used to collect ongoing feedback from people with brain injury, their caregivers and clinicians at Shepherd Center, a rehabilitation hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The research design and results of clinical testing are also described. Results indicate EyeRemember is a clinically effective tool for memory compensation for some people with BI and suggests combining wearable computers with BLE beacons may be effective assistive technology. These results support previous research summarized in systematic guidelines recommending the use of external memory aids for memory compensation after BI and indicate it is likely these guidelines are applicable to novel and emerging technologies. The results also further validate previous research demonstrating systematic instruction as an effective method for training the use of technology for people with memory problems.

These advertisements and other BLE frames are subject to collisions. The collision probability increases as the number of devices increases. Nonetheless, because of the capture effect, receivers may correctly decode some of the frames involved in a collision. Recent studies proposed models and simulations for the BLE discovery process, showing the impact of the advertisement collisions as well as the importance of an appropriate selection of the parameters related to the discovery process. The impact of the capture effect in these studies is unclear. Here we report the impact of the capture effect on the BLE advertisements. In particular, we show that the capture effect systematically increases the advertisement reception rate. We establish upper and lower bounds to quantify the contribution of the capture effect to the packet delivery ratio in dense scenarios. We make measurements in a controlled environment (a Faraday box) to show the presence of the capture effect in networks with 2 to 14 advertisers. Empirical results show that for 14 devices the capture effect increases the advertisement delivery rate by 2.95% on average, with a peak of 7.8%. Using simulations to recreate dense scenarios (up to 1000 advertisers) we show that the capture effect can increase the packet delivery ratio by up to 25%. Our results have implications in the performance analysis of the discovery process and provide insights for the design of BLE applications and protocols that leverage on BLE advertisements.

The proposed dc-dc buck converter is capable of handling loads from 10 mu A to 20 mA with high efficiency by applying triple mode (retention mode, PFM mode, and PWM mode), gate split technique, and AZCD. Retention mode is proposed to extend wide load range at ultralight load. Gate split technique adjusts the conduction loss and switching loss. AZCD reduces the operation duty of the high-speed comparator and avoid reverse current below light load. In IoT applications, each node communicates with other nodes through a Bluetooth low energy transceiver, which consumes very low current and is highly sensitive to supply noise. Therefore, the proposed dc-dc buck converter adopts the SSCG technique to reduce electromagnetic interference by up to 18 dB. This chip is implemented using 0.13 mu m CMOS technology with an active area of 820 x 800 mu m(2). The maximum power efficiency of the proposed dc-dc buck converter is 92.4% at a switching frequency of 2.5 MHz when the load current range is 10 to 20 mA. The input voltage range and the regulated output voltage are 2.2-3.3 and 1.7 V, respectively. In addition, the proposed dc-dc buck converter achieves over 74.2% efficiency in retention mode when the load current range is from 10 to 500 mu A.

Wireless connection of sensors and actuators in industrial environments not only enables wireless monitoring and actuation, it also enables coordination of production stages, connecting mobile robots and autonomous transport vehicles, as well as localization and tracking of assets. All these opportunities already inspired the development of many wireless technologies in an effort to fully enable Industry 4.0. However, different technologies significantly differ in performance and capabilities, none being capable of supporting all industrial use cases. When designing a network solution, one must be aware of the capabilities and the trade-offs that prospective technologies have. This paper evaluates the technologies potentially suitable for IWSAN solutions covering an entire industrial site with limited infrastructure cost and discusses their trade-offs in an effort to provide information for choosing the most suitable technology for the use case of interest. The comparative discussion presented in this paper aims to enable engineers to choose the most suitable wireless technology for their specific IWSAN deployment.

J	Li, XN; Dai, ZC; He, LM				Li, Xiaonian; Dai, Zhicheng; He, Lamei			A K-nearest neighbor indoor fingerprint location method based on coarse positioning circular domain and the highest similarity threshold	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						BLE; fingerprint location; coarse positioning; K-nearest neighbor; threshold	LOCALIZATION	There are two problems with traditional indoor fingerprint location methods. First, irrelevant fingerprints in a fingerprint database interfere with the matching phase, which leads to poor positioning accuracy and stability of positioning results, and second, there is a large amount of computational overhead in the matching phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a K-nearest neighbor indoor fingerprint location method based on coarse positioning circular domain and the highest similarity threshold. In this method, a circular domain is formed in a coarse positioning process to narrow the positioning range. It solves the problem of the interference of irrelevant fingerprints. At the same time, a fault-tolerant mechanism is introduced to adjust the circular domain dynamically to ensure that the coarse positioning circular domain contains high similarity reference points and improve the fault tolerance of the coarse positioning. This method consists of offline and online phases. In the offline phase, the values of the received signal strength from Bluetooth low energy are preprocessed using a Gaussian filter to construct a fingerprint database. In the online phase, irrelevant fingerprints are filtered out by using the coarse positioning method. The filtered fingerprints are then matched with a testing point by the K-nearest neighbor algorithm, and the weighted centroids of the nearest reference points are solved. Finally, the coordinate of the testing point is obtained. The experimental results show that this method can effectively improve indoor positioning accuracy when compared with the traditional K-nearest neighbor. The average positioning error of the proposed method is 0.844 m.

The real-time BP can be estimated utilising a 2-parameter regression model based on the pulse arrival time (PAT) and heart rate (HR). The PAT is defined as the time interval between the electrocardiogram (ECG) R-peak and the corresponding maximum inclination point of photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. A wireless wearable sensor patch designed to be attached to the subject's chest is used for the measurement of ECG and PPG signals. The sensor data are transmitted through a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module to a computer for the real-time online estimation of BP. To verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, a 5-day period experiment is conducted on two healthy male subjects for the training and validation of the BP estimation model. On each day, there are two 15 minutes offline sessions for data collection from the sensor patch, which are compared with the reference BP to calibrate the estimation model parameters. After that, a 10 minutes online session is carried out to validate the regression model against the reference BP device. Eventually, the 5-day period data are combined together for an overall BP estimation model, which has good correlation (r=0.82) with the reference BP measurements. The experimental results show the proposed sensor patch with the BP estimation model is capable of the online real-time BP monitoring after an initial calibration procedure.

C	Sato, A; Nakajima, M; Kohtake, N			IEEE	Sato, Akihiro; Nakajima, Madoka; Kohtake, Naohiko			Rapid BLE Beacon Localization with Range-Only EKF-SLAM Using Beacon Interval Constraint	2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDOOR POSITIONING AND INDOOR NAVIGATION (IPIN)	International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	SEP 30-OCT 03, 2019	Pisa, ITALY	Consiglio Nazl Ric, Ist Scienza Tecnologie Informazione Faedo				The installation process of numerous Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons in the indoor positioning environment usually requires the manual measurement of the beacon's physical coordinates which tends to be a labor-intensive process. In this work, we aim to create a BLE beacon map by obtaining their coordinates from in situ Received Signal Strength (RSS) observations on a smartphone in a short period of time. This paper proposes a method of automatic localization for twin BLE beacons based on Range-Only Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (RO-SLAM) approach and multi-hypothesis Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), on the condition that only the relative distance of twin beacons is known. In this method, a person holding a smartphone collects RSS of BLE beacons by walking around with no requirement of predefined trajectory. Normally, the lack of angular information on the sensor involves the difficulty of finding a good initial value of the state vector in the EKF, that requires substantial time to evolve the estimation enough. In our proposed method, tracking the multiple hypotheses which represent the probability distribution of possible locations of the BLE beacon and smartphone makes the results obtainable in a brief RSS survey. The hypotheses generation process employs the interval information of twin BLE beacons to reduce the number of hypotheses and consequently the computational load. The experimental evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf devices show that the proposed method offers a significant improvement in the time required to evolve the location estimation, while the use of twin BLE beacons can suppress the total number of hypotheses.

In particular, discovering and bootstrapping a wireless connection (e.g., WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy) between two devices that share no prior knowledge, commonly known as pairing, often requires users to go through cumbersome tasks of manually discovering the target device and entering a long passkey. When the devices do not have a proper user interface to enter a passkey, the security of pairing is often given up, leaving the communication vulnerable to a number of attacks. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a usable and secure out-of-band (OOB) communication method called SYNCVIBE, leveraging the inherent nature of close-proximity transmission of mechanical vibration. SYNCVIBE utilizes a vibration motor and an accelerometer, that are already ubiquitously available or easy to embed in mobile and wearable devices, to transmit and receive pairing information. By simply keeping two devices in direct contact, the user can bootstrap a secure, high-bandwidth wireless connection without manual pairing procedures. The proposed method maximizes accuracy and effective data throughput with a vibration clock recovery technique, which inserts a minimal amount of extra bit patterns to assure synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver. In addition, SYNCVIBE can automatically adjust its detection thresholds in response to various vibration noises and transmission media. Our implementation of SYNCVIBE demonstrates high-accuracy transmission, proving itself as a suitable OOB communication channel for short data transmission for secure device pairing.

A basic activity tracker has given many data on the user's movement to fulfill their daily goal of calories burned. An advance tracker can also measure heart rate with accurate activity intense level. However, consider if these fitness devices can be used for clinical diagnosis by adding an ECG, then it can be a daily health monitoring or a health assisted device by connecting it to the internet via a smartphone. To use an ECG as a wearable device, the electrode positions has to fulfill the clinical placement. A new biomedical electrodes placement is proposed in this paper to meet the practicality of a fitness lifestyle device but has a medical ECG result for continuous heart monitoring in a form of a necklace. The device has a single lead ECG analog front end that is connected to an ARM-Cortex M4 microcontroller. It uses a 4 GB memory card, rechargeable battery, and a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 to communicate with an Android 4.3 smartphone. The test results were taken from a 32-year-old male subject with normal heart condition. The signal acquired from the electrode placement at the backside of the neck shows Lead I waveform with 10% from the normal position amplitude value. The R-wave of every heartbeat can be seen for heart rate calculation. Therefore, it is able to do a daily heart monitoring with a lifestyle device.

J	Chen, SH; Chuang, YC; Chang, CC				Chen, Shao-Hao; Chuang, Yung-Chi; Chang, Cheng-Chun			Development of a Portable All-Wavelength PPG Sensing Device for Robust Adaptive-Depth Measurement: A Spectrometer Approach with a Hydrostatic Measurement Example	SENSORS			English	Article						all-wavelengths; PPG; hydrostatic pressure	PRESSURE	Photoplethysmography (PPG), a noninvasive optical sensing technology, has been widely used to measure various physiological indices. Over-the-counter PPG devices are typically composed of a single-wavelength light source, namely, single-wavelength PPG (SW-PPG). It is known that signals of SW-PPG are easily contaminated or distorted by measurement conditions such as motion artifacts, wearing pressure, and skin type. Since lights of different wavelengths can penetrate skin tissues at different depths, how to effectively construct a multiwavelength PPG (MW-PPG) device or even an all-wavelength PPG (AW-PPG) device has attracted great attention. There is also a very interesting question, that is, what could be the potential benefits of using MW-PPG or AW-PPG devices? This paper demonstrates the construction of an AW-PPG portable device and conducts a preliminary evaluation. The presented device consists of four light-emitting diodes, a chip-scale spectrometer, a microcontroller, a Bluetooth Low Energy transceiver, and a phone app. The maximum ratio combining algorithm (MRC) is used to combine the PPG signals derived from different wavelengths to achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The PPG signals from the developed MRC-AW-PPG device versus those from the conventional SW-PPG device are compared in terms of different hydrostatic pressure conditions. It has been observed that the MRC-AW-PPG device can provide more stable PPG signals than that of a conventional PPG device. The results shine a light on the potential benefits of using multiple wavelengths for the next generation of noninvasive PPG sensing.

However, due to their short transmission distances, the delivery of urgent messages (e.g., emergency alarms) over long distance, suffers from long delay, since the messages have to be transported via multi-hop way. Recent studies show that adding low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) radios such as LoRa onto WPAN devices (e.g., Bluetooth) effectively overcomes the limitation. However, the introduce of heterogeneous communication inevitably incurs extra hardware cost, deployment inconvenience and traffic overhead from gateways. In this paper, we present BLE2LoRa, a novel Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to LoRaWAN cross-technology communication (CTC) approach, which leverages the frequency shifting ability of BLE device to emulate LoRa's chirp signal. Such emulation is feasible because a chirp is a signal whose frequency increases or decreases over time, while a BLE device can also construct specific signals with ladder-shaped frequencies which is similar to LoRa chirp by carefully selecting BLE payload bits. Therefore, without any hardware modification at both sender and receiver side, a LoRa device can demodulate BLE frames. Moreover, leveraging the high sensitivity of LoRa base station, a long distant CTC can be achieved. We bulid our BLE2LoRa prototype on USRP B210 (with LoRaWAN PHY) and commodity BLE chips (CC1200). Our evaluation reveals that BLE2LoRa can achieve 4.06kbps throughput from BLE to LoRa with more than 80% frame reception rate, leading to over 600 meters communication distance, which is over 20x range extension over native Bluetooth.

The trainability of brain rhythm using a neurofeedback system is uncertainty because various experimental designs are used in previous studies. The current study aimed to develop a portable wireless NFT system for alpha rhythm and to validate effect of the NFT system on memory with a sham-controlled group. Methods: The proposed system contained an EEG signal analysis device and a smartphone with wireless Bluetooth low-energy technology. Instantaneous 1-s EEG power and contiguous 5-min EEG power throughout the training were developed as feedback information. The training performance and its progression were kept to boost usability of our device. Participants were blinded and randomly assigned into either the control group receiving random 4-Hz power or Alpha group receiving 8-12-Hz power. Working memory and episodic memory were assessed by the backward digital span task and word-pair task, respectively. Results: The portable neurofeedback system had advantages of a tiny size and long-term recording and demonstrated trainability of alpha rhythm in terms of significant increase of power and duration of 8-12 Hz. Moreover, accuracies of the backward digital span task and word-pair task showed significant enhancement in the Alpha group after training compared to the control group. Conclusions: Our tiny portable device demonstrated success trainability of alpha rhythm and enhanced two kinds of memories. The present study suggest that the portable neurofeedback system provides an alternative intervention for memory enhancement.

J	Maxwell, D; Couper, R				Maxwell, Duncan; Couper, Rachel			Construction tracking: implications of logistics data	CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND			English	Article						Logistics; Tracking; Construction; Prototype; Bluetooth; Data	INDUSTRY	Purpose Construction suffers from "peculiarities" that concern the temporary natures of the construction site, project teams and unique product design. Considering the digital transformation of construction, new solutions are being investigated that can provide consistent data between changing projects. One such source of data manifests in the tracking of logistics activities across the supply chain. Construction logistics is traditionally considered a site management activity focused solely on the "back end" of projects, but an expanded logistics focus can unlock new avenues of improvement. This study aims to understand the requirements and benefits of such a consistent thread of data. Design/methodology/approach From a research project with one of Australia's largest contracting companies, this paper details a series of construction tracking tests as an empirical case study in using Bluetooth low energy aware tracking technology to capture data across the manufacture, delivery and assembly of a cross-laminated timber structural prototyping project. Findings The findings affirm the tracking of expanded logistics data can improve back-end performance in subsequent projects while also demonstrating the opportunity to inform a project's unique front-end design phase. The case study demonstrates that as the reliability, range and battery life of tracking technologies improve, their incorporation into a broader range of construction activities provides invaluable data for improvement across projects. Originality/value As a live case study, this research offers unique insights into the potential of construction tracking to close the data loop from final site assembly back to the early project design phase, thus driving continual improvement from a holistic perspective.

Owing to the importance of driver drowsiness and the possibility for brainwaves-based DDD, many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based approaches have been proposed. However, few studies focus on the early detection of driver drowsiness and on the early management of driver drowsiness using a closed-loop algorithm. The reported wireless and wearable BMI system is used for 1) simultaneous EEG and gyroscope-based head movement measurement for the early detection of driver drowsiness and 2) simultaneous EEG and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for the early management of driver drowsiness. To achieve the purposes of easy-to-use and distraction-free driving, a Bluetooth low-energy module is embedded in this BMI system and used to communicate with a fully wearable consumer device, a smartwatch, which coordinates the work of drowsiness monitoring and brain stimulation with its embedded closed-loop algorithm. The proposed system offers a 128 Hz sampling rate per channel, 12-bit and 16-bit resolution for a single-channel EEG and a three-channel gyroscope, and a maximum 2 mA current for the tDCS. The current consumption of the whole headset system is 56 mA. The battery life of the smartwatch is 9 h. The DDD experimental results show that the proposed system obtained a 93.67% five-level overall accuracy, a 96.15% two-level (alert versus slightly drowsy) accuracy, and maximum 16- to 23-min wakefulness maintenance.

Continuous monitoring of vital parameters allows detecting diseases in an early state. In this paper, we propose a wrist-wearable low-power device able to monitor body physiological signals as temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and monitor daily activities and on this basis to detect falls. The device is also able to transmit and receive data with an Android App using a Bluetooth Low-Energy interface. For counting the beats, we propose a novel low processing consumption peak detection algorithm. For detecting the oxygen saturation some approaches have been followed (in time and frequency domains) to obtain the attributes for the further functional analyses of the monitoring process. The results show the monitoring and tracking functionalities of this wearable. Tests performed shows the good performing of all sensors, being able to measure body temperature, detect and measure heart rate and oxygen saturation with less than a 2% of deviation and detect mostly of the most usual fall types; all this integrated in a low-power low-size solution. As the conclusion, the viability of this implementation has been more than proved given the fact that some providers are interested in deploying such wearable in their elderly home residences. A low-cost and low-power device IoT system can be integrated into the existing care workflow and may reduce patient fall risk being an elusive patient safety challenge based on the technological gadget.

J	Lee, BG; Lee, BL; Chung, WY				Lee, Boon-Giin; Lee, Boon-Leng; Chung, Wan-Young			Wristband-Type Driver Vigilance Monitoring System Using Smartwatch	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Accelerometer sensor; Bluetooth; gyroscope sensor; motion sensors; photoplethysmogram; smartwatch; wristband	DROWSINESS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ALERTNESS; FATIGUE; FUSION	Studies have presented that the driver vigilance level has serious implication in the causation of road accidents. This paper focuses on integrating both the vehicle-based control behavior and physiological state to predict the driver vigilance index which is evaluated by using a smartwatch. The vehicle control behavior can be observed from the steering wheel movement. Our study utilized the smartwatch motion sensors to study the steering wheel behavior. Meanwhile, physiological state of driver reflects the driver capability of safety alert driving which is estimated by photoplethysmogram (PPG) and respiration signals in this paper. The PPG sensor is integrated in a sport wristband with a Bluetooth low energy module, transmitted the PPG signals to smartwatch in real time. The steering angle is derived by the reading from smartwatch built-in accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. On the other hand, the respiration is derived using the PPG peak baseline method. In order to utterly investigate the sleepiness-induced factors, the time, spectral, and phase space domain features are calculated. Considering the smartwatch processing capability, mutual-information technique is applied to designate the ten most descriptive features. Then, the extracted descriptive features are serve as parameters to a classifier to determine the driver aptitude status. The features are analyzed for their correlation with the subjective Koralinska sleepiness scale and through recorded video observations. The experimental results reveal that our system is capable of estimating driver hypervigilance at average of 96.5% accuracy rate by evaluating on both driving behavior and driver physiological state, provided a novel and low-cost implementation.

This situation can arise in a smartphone-based indoor positioning system when we want to locate a moving user in real-time with sustainable accuracy, but the RSS sampling ability of smartphones is limited; for example, one RSS sample per second. Firstly, by investigating RSS's heterogeneity, we offer a solution for RSS-based continuous positioning problems under a low RSS sampling rate that satisfies real-time requirements. Secondly, we propose a method to improve accuracy for the RSS-based position estimation method, i.e., multilateration using Least Square Estimation. We consider PDR-based and improved RSS-based positions both have Gaussian uncertainty due to initial position plus drifting and RSS-to-distance conversion, respectively. Then, the Kalman filter will fuse two kinds of Gaussian distribution to produce more precise positions. The method is intended to design a real-time system for locating a moving target. Experiments are conducted in real indoor space with a commodity device. Its results show that our proposed solution is highly accurate and feasible in actual deployment.

The bimorph generator is in cantilever beam structure formed by laminating two lead zirconate titanate thick-film layers on both sides of a stainless steel substrate. Aiming to scavenge vibration energy efficiently from the environment and transform into useful electrical energy, the two piezoelectric layers on the device can be poled for serial and parallel connections to enhance the output voltage or output current respectively. In addition, a tungsten proof mass is bonded at the tip of the device to adjust the resonance frequency. The experimental result shows superior performance the generator. At the 0.5 g base excitation acceleration level, the devices pooled for serial connection and the device poled for parallel connection possess an open-circuit output voltage of 11.6 VP-P and 20.1 VP-P, respectively. The device poled for parallel connection reaches a maximum power output of 423 mu W and an output voltage of 15.2 VP-P at an excitation frequency of 143.4 Hz and an externally applied based excitation acceleration of 1.5 g, whereas the device poled serial connection achieves a maximum power output of 413 mu W and an output voltage of 33.0 VP-P at an excitation frequency of 140.8 Hz and an externally applied base excitation acceleration of 1.5 g. To demonstrate the feasibility of the MEMS generator for real applications, we finished the demonstration of a self-powered Bluetooth low energy wireless temperature sensor sending readings to a smartphone with only the power from the MEMS generator harvesting from vibration.

Cooperative Body Channel Communications for Energy-Efficient Internet of Bodies	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Transceivers; Energy efficiency; Radio frequency; Resource management; Network topology; Internet of Things; Topology; Body area networks; body channel communications (BCCs); capacitive coupling (CC); energy efficient; galvanic coupling (GC); human body communications; Internet of Bodies (IoB); Internet of Things (IoT); multiple access; power control	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; NOMA	The Internet of Bodies (IoB) is a network formed by wearable, implantable, ingestible, and injectable smart devices to collect physiological, behavioral, and structural information from the human body. Thus, the IoB technology can revolutionize the quality of human life by using these context-rich data in myriad smart-health applications. Radio frequency (RF) transceivers have been typically preferred due to their availability and maturity. However, for most RF standards (e.g., Bluetooth low energy), the highly radiative omnidirectional RF propagation (even at the lowest settings) reaches tens of meters of coverage, thereby reducing energy efficiency, causing interference and co-existence issues, and raising privacy and security concerns. On the other hand, body channel communication (BCC) confines low-power and low-frequency (10 kHz-100 MHz) signals to the human body, leading to more secure and efficient communications. Since energy efficiency is one of the critical design parameters of IoB networks, this article focuses on energy-efficient orthogonal body channel access (OBA) and non-OBA (NOBA) schemes with and without cooperation. To this aim, three main BCC topologies are presented: 1) point-to-point channel; 2) medium access channel; and 3) broadcast channel. These topologies are then used as building blocks to create IoB networks relying on OBA and NOBA schemes for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) traffic. For all schemes and traffic directions, optimal transmit power and phase time allocations are derived in closed-form, which is essential to reduce energy consumption by eliminating computational power. The closed-form expressions are further leveraged to obtain maximum network size as a function of data rate requirement, bandwidth, and hardware parameters.

For locking DCO frequency closest to the target channel, it adaptively controls capacitor banks with binary algorithm. With decrease in frequency resolution, DCO clock counts for each capacitor bank bit evaluation dynamically increases with the proposed technique for accurate frequency tracking. For compensating PVT variations and finding the BLE frequency deviation, the configurable digital DCO gain estimation is incorporated. The low power and constant current DCO operates in sub-threshold region and its power consumption is minimized by g(m)/I-D methodology optimization, constant current source for limiting current in DCO core through adaptive low-dropout regulator (LDO) and lowering the supply voltage. The proposed design is integrated in an ADPLL for BLE transceiver and it is fabricated with 1P6M TSMC 55 nm CMOS technology. The all-digital adaptive FLL is fully synthesizable and its area is 1800 mu m(2) with 1.233 K gate count. The RMS current consumption is 103.32 mu A from 1 V voltage supply with 103.32 mu W power requirement. The experimental results reveal, DCO draws 480 mu A current from 0.55 V supply voltage at center frequency. It has frequency resolution of 4.8 kHz. The oscillator PN, FOM and FOMT at 1-MHz offset frequency from 2.44 GHz carrier frequency are -122.85 dBc/Hz, 196.38 dBc/Hz and 208.19 dBc/Hz, respectively.

Since these packet protocol grammars consist of packets of limited size it is possible to parse them efficiently via Finite State Machines (FSM). However, parsing via FSMs would require developers to either express the grammars via regular expressions or constructed hand-coded parsers. Unfortunately, hand-coding parsers is error-prone; furthermore, due in part to certain constructs found in such grammars which are not commonly found in text-based regular grammars. In addition, expressing binary grammar constructs in regular expression is not only challenging and error-prone but the resulting expressions are often complex and unreadable. Thus the lack of an alternative language for describing these constructs is a hindrance to the use of finite state machines to generate parsers which are safe, secure and computationally bounded. This paper presents a novel secure parser generation framework which consists of an easy-to-use parser description language called "Microparse" and a toolkit that utilizes finite state machines to generate lightweight parsers for microcontrollers. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we have applied our framework to generate parsers for the BLE protocol running on an Ubertooth One Microcontroller. We demonstrate that the generated FSMs are lightweight enough to be run on devices with very limited resources, and are easier to use for developers; we offer this method as a potential solution for the various bugs found in the implementation of the BLE firmware in the recent years.

In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, its incidence and impact increase after acute illness, increasing the risk of functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, such therapeutic exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. The presented device, BandPass, aims to create an integrated force data detection and acquisition system for monitoring and transmitting at-home exercise force data to patients and clinicians. A potentiometer-based sensor was integrated to a resistance exercise band through the use of custom designed electronics, which incorporated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless transmission to a mobile 'app'. A protocol for calibrating the device was developed using a range of loads and validated in static benchtop and dynamic testing. Data from a pilot study with 7 older adults was also collected and analyzed to test the device. BandPass is 94% accurate with a coefficient of variation (CoV) of 4.9% and sensitivity of 150g. The pilot study recorded 147 exercises, allowing for analysis on patients' exercise performances. BandPass was successfully able to measure force continuously over time during exercises, measure longitudinal compliance with exercises, and quantify force continuously over time. A mobile health (mHealth) force-sensing system allows for the remote monitoring of prescribed in-home resistance exercise band programs for at-risk older adults, bridging the gap between clinicians and patients.

Environmental observation, home surveillance, and assistive supports are now built on wearable devices using inertia-based sensors, such as accelerometers, linear acceleration, and gyroscopes. However, previous assisted living system (ALS) still faces challenges in energy management and resource allocation when performing daily activities, particularly with ambulation. Legacy systems cannot fully improve self-esteem, hence, WearROBOT, which detects rearview obstacles and has an audio feedback system incorporated for voicing out once an obstacle is detected. Linear programing (LP) multi-commodity graph (LMCG) learning model is proposed while coupling the shortest path resource allocation for space diversity linearization. An Infrared sensor problem function that minimizes link utilization is derived. Angle-Intensity analysis (AIA) was carried out on various use case scenarios to enable the user to know the best angle to consider depending on its usage and battery conservation. This work showed how intensity differs at various angles of 5 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, 35 degrees, and 45 degrees. Also, the reflectivity of different materials and how it affects the battery life are studied. As the wearable robot moves away from the node-obstacle, the LMCG narrow-band sensor node (LMCG-NB-IoT) drops energy significantly. The Low Power WAN (LP-WAN), Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and proposed LMCG-NB-IoT offered 51.28%, 33.33%, and 15.39% respectively. In terms of energy latency, the schemes gave 65.63%, 31.25%, and 3.12% respectively. Similarly, the proposed LMCG-NB-IoT had a 50% battery life profile. Finally, WearROBOT mobility aid minimizes injuries experienced by the visually impaired.

These could be jeopardized by their wandering behavior. Mobile applications that focus on health care have received special interest from medical specialists. These applications have been widely accepted, due to the availability of smart devices that include sensors. However, sensor-based applications are highly energy demanding and as such, they can be unaffordable in mobile e-health control due to battery constraints., is paper presents the design and implementation of a platform aimed at providing support in e-health control and provision of location services for wandering patients through real-time medical and mobility information analysis. The platform includes a configurable mobile application for heart rate and stress level monitoring based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE), and a web service for monitoring and control of the wandering patients. Due to battery limitations of smart devices with sensors, the mobile application includes energy-efficient handling and transmission policies to make more efficient the transmission of medical information from the sensor-based smart device to the web service. In turn, the web service provides e-health control services for patients and caregivers. Through the platform functionality, caregivers (and patients) can receive notifications and suggestions in response to emergency, contingency situations, or deviations from health and mobility patterns of the wandering patients., is paper describes a platform that conceals continuous monitoring with energy-efficient applications in favor of e-health control of wandering patients.

This paper presents the development and realization of a novel smart insole for monitoring the plantar pressure distribution and gait parameters; indeed, it includes a piezoresistive sensing matrix based on a Velostat layer for transducing applied pressure into an electric signal. At first, an accurate and complete characterization of Velostat-based pressure sensors is reported as a function of sizes, support material, and pressure trend. The realization and testing of a low-cost and reliable piezoresistive sensing matrix based on a sandwich structure are discussed. This last is interfaced with a low power conditioning and processing section based on an Arduino Lilypad board and an analog multiplexer for acquiring the pressure data. The insole includes a 3-axis capacitive accelerometer for detecting the gait parameters (swing time and stance phase time) featuring the walking. A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0 module is included for transmitting in real-time the acquired data toward a PC, tablet or smartphone, for displaying and processing them using a custom Processing (R) application. Moreover, the smart insole is equipped with a piezoelectric harvesting section for scavenging energy from walking. The onfield tests indicate that for a walking speed higher than 1 ms(-1), the device's power requirements (i.e., (P) over bar = 5.84 mW) was fulfilled. However, more than 9 days of autonomy are guaranteed by the integrated 380-mAh Lipo battery in the total absence of energy contributions from the harvesting section.

AirChat: Ad Hoc Network Monitoring with Drones	2017 SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION ENGINEERING DESIGN SYMPOSIUM (SIEDS)			English	Proceedings Paper	Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS)	APR 28, 2017	Charlottesville, VA			FireChat; Mesh Network; WiFi Pineapple		FireChat is a mobile messaging application that uses a mesh network topology to communicate between users through a cellular, WiFi, or Bluetooth Low Energy connection. FireChat has seen global growth for use in crowded events such as protests. The team has worked in conjunction with the MITRE Corporation to develop a system that attaches to a quadrotor and monitors nearby connections to gather metadata on the FireChat. This information is analyzed to provide insight into the structure of large groups or specific devices using FireChat. The WiFi Pineapple Nano, Ubertooth One, and HackRF One were tested for monitoring FireChat. From these three, the Pineapple was selected to monitor WiFi and the Ubertooth was chosen to monitor Bluetooth. The devices were evaluated based upon their ability to provide useful data, meet size, weight, and power requirements, and function across all platforms on which FireChat can be installed. While the Ubertooth provided some relevant data about the use of FireChat, it was inconsistent so Bluetooth development was discontinued. The Pineapple, however, successfully collects the MAC address and connected routers of the FireChat devices. A Raspberry Pi runs scripts to control the Pineapple to scan WiFi networks and collect FireChat data. Further, the time and location will be saved based on timing of received data and location of the quadrotor. This data is sent to a server using the Particle Electron, a 3G cellular communication board, where further analytics are performed. The analysis provided to the sponsor is able to identify the location of certain FireChat users, their progression over time, and common communication networks in which they participate.

We analyze the design of BT and devise a robust de-anonymization technique that hinges on the apparently benign information leaking from frame encoding, to infer a piconet's clock, hopping sequence, and ultimately the Upper Address Part (UAP) of the master device's physical address, which are never exchanged in clear. Used together with the Lower Address Part (LAP), which is present in all frames transmitted, this enables tracking of the piconet master, thereby debunking the privacy guarantees of BT. We validate this attack by developing the first Software-defined Radio (SDR) based sniffer that allows full BT spectrum analysis (79 MHz) and implements the proposed de-anonymization technique. We study the feasibility of privacy attacks with multiple testbeds, considering different numbers of devices, traffic regimes, and communication ranges. We demonstrate that it is possible to track BT devices up to 85 meters from the sniffer, and achieve more than 80% device identification accuracy within less than 1 second of sniffing and 100% detection within less than 4 seconds. Lastly, we study the identified privacy attack in the wild, capturing BT traffic at a road junction over 5 days, demonstrating that our system can re-identify hundreds of users and infer their commuting patterns.

Evaluating them wirelessly at preclinical stage (e.g., in a rodent model), however, is a major challenge due to weak coupling and significant losses, resulting in limited power delivery to the IMD within a nominal experimental arena, like a homecage, without surpassing the specific absorption rate limit. To address this problem, we present a dual-band EnerCage system with two multi-coil inductive links, which first deliver power at 13.56 MHz from the EnerCage (46 x 24 x 20 cm(3)) to a head-stage (18x18x15 mm(3), 4.8 g) that is carried by the animal via a 4-coil inductive link. Then, a 60 MHz 3-coil inductive link from the headstage powers up the small IMD(2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 mm(3), 15 mg), which in this case is a free floating, wirelessly powered, implantable optical stimulator (FF-WIOS). The power transfer efficiency and power delivered to the load (PDL) from EnerCage to the headstage at 7 cm height were 14.9%-22.7% and 122 mW; and from headstage to FF-WIOS at 5 mm depth were 18% and 2.7 mW, respectively. Bidirectional data connectivity between EnerCage-headstage was established via bluetooth low energy. Between headstage and FF-WIOS, ON-OFF keying and load-shift-keying were used for downlink and uplink data, respectively. Moreover, a closed-loop power controller stabilized PDL to both the headstage and the FF-WIOS against misalignments.

We recently showed that iterating between the AoA and position estimation steps allows significant positioning gains. However, the existing algorithms only perform well under a Line-of-Sight (LOS) condition. In this letter, we propose an enhanced AoA-based iterative positioning algorithm with anchor selection in the presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation. The proposed algorithm can identify and mitigate the NLOS anchors by comparing the variances of the intermediate estimated position for all possible combinations of anchors with predefined thresholds. Finally, the estimated position based on the selected anchors is converted back to the angle information and used as prior information for the next iteration. The numerical results show that applying the anchor selection strategy significantly improves the positioning accuracy in indoor environments.

Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of applications in augmented and virtual reality, sign language recognition, rehabilitation healthcare, sports analytics, etc. However, unlike vision, there are no large-scale training datasets for developing robust machine learning (ML) models on wearable devices. ssLOTR designs ML models based on data augmentation and self-supervised learning to first extract efficient representations from raw IMU data without the need for any training labels. The extracted representations are further trained with small-scale labeled training data. In comparison to fully supervised learning, we show that only 15% of labeled training data is sufficient with self-supervised learning to achieve similar accuracy. Our sensor device is designed using a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB) to minimize the footprint and uses a combination of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as housing materials for sturdiness and flexibility. It incorporates a system-on-chip (SoC) microcontroller with integrated WiFi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules for real-time wireless communication, portability, and ubiquity. In contrast to gloves, our device is worn like rings on fingers, and therefore, does not impede dexterous finger motion. Extensive evaluation with 12 users depicts a 3D joint angle tracking accuracy of 9.07. ( joint position accuracy of 6.55mm) with robustness to natural variation in sensor positions, wrist motion, etc, with low overhead in latency and power consumption on embedded platforms.

The crucial idea is to scan and record close contacts between users using mobile device, in order to notify persons when their close contact(s) is diagnosed positive. First, the ability granted to service providers of the contact tracing systems to access user data violates user privacy, and attackers can fabricate identities and contact records in their devices, which harms the integrity of the system. Moreover, current contact tracing systems' false-positive rate is too high to be practical as they do not filter scan results outside the range of infections, since the range of transmission for droplets is far less than the scanning range for Bluetooth Low Energy used by these systems. Furthermore, current systems neglect airborne transmission, a far cry from a tool against viruses suspended in the air. In this paper, we propose a cryptographic framework for contact tracing and provide a construction based on public key rerandomizable BLS signature, being capable of providing users of contact tracing with comprehensive privacy protection. Besides, we also implement a commitment scheme to prevent fabrication of identities and contact records. To prove the concept of our framework and to solve other problems mentioned above, we proposed a new contact tracing system, using environmental factors (temperature, humidity and airflow) to filter out results outside estimated effective transmission distance, and also take airborne transmission into consideration. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our design by implementing our algorithm on mobile devices with satisfactory results.

Typically based on signal strength measurement, a power level map is created first in the learning phase to align with measured values in the inference. Second, the location is determined by taking the point for which the recorded received power level is closest to the power level actually measured. The biggest limit of this technique is the reliability of power measurements, which may lack accuracy in many wireless systems. To this end, this work extends the power level measurement by using multiple anchors and multiple radio channels and, consequently, considers different approaches to aligning the actual measurements with the recorded values. The dataset is available online. This article focuses on the very popular radio technology Bluetooth Low Energy to explore the possible improvement of the system accuracy through different machine learning approaches. It shows how the accuracy-complexity trade-off influences the possible candidate algorithms on an example of three-channel Bluetooth received signal strength based fingerprinting in a one dimensional environment with four static anchors and in a two dimensional environment with the same set of anchors. We provide a literature survey to identify the machine learning algorithms applied in the literature to show that the studies available can not be compared directly. Then, we implement and analyze the performance of four most popular supervised learning techniques, namely k Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. In our scenario, the most promising machine learning technique being the Random Forest with classification accuracy over 99%.

Low-power Bluetooth technology has the characteristics of low-cost, easy deployment and low power consumption, supporting all mainstream smartphone operating systems, and attracting extensive attention from academic and industry field. In this paper, aiming at the situation that current Bluetooth low energy positioning accuracy has large fluctuation under the circumstance of multipath propagation, external disturbance and other factors, and has poor user experience, a Bluetooth localization algorithm based on map path calibration and time series filtering is proposed (MCTF). This algorithm comprehensively utilizes a post-processing method based on the average sliding window, time-series based spatial restraint post-processing method and path information based location calibration method, effectively eliminating the large fluctuation of positioning results caused by multipath propagation and other external wireless signal interference in complex indoor environment. By using map information, based on the fact that position cannot be transient, utilizing feedback filtering, positioning results can get path correction and direction correction respectively, solving the problem that the positioning coordinates jump between adjacent narrow aisles and jump back and forth on the same path during the positioning process. Extensive experiments performed in shopping mall, building office, exhibition center and other typical indoor environments demonstrate that the average positioning error of the proposed algorithm is within 1.5 m, which has good robustness and ensures the smoothness, accuracy and stability of the positioning result.

Gesture recognition is usually done by using vision-based techniques or hand-attached sensors that track hand and finger movements. This paper presents a sensors-based Arabic Sign Language recognition system. The proposed system depends on the information fusion from a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) sensors. The architecture of the proposed system consists of two main modules: a wearable device (glove), which includes sensors, a communication unit, and micro-controller unit, and a software module running on a mobile device. The proposed glove system utilizes six IMUs sensors where five of them placed at the fingers and the sixth sensor placed at the back of the palm. The collected data from sensors are transmitted to a mobile device through a Bluetooth low-energy wireless transmission for data analysis and gesture recognition. For each gesture, the beginning and endpoints of the significative gesture part are discovered automatically using the intensity of the gyroscope signal. The system employs a features-based sensor fusion that combines accelerometer and gyroscope time-domain and frequency-domain features. In a comprehensive set of experiments with seven participants, the system was trained and tested with 28 Arabic alphabets, and the best recognition accuracy achieved was 98.6% for the user-dependent data and 96% for the user-independent data under support vector machine classifier. The achieved results are outperforming existing systems that have been presented in recent decades for alphabet-level gesture recognition.

Bluetooth is a widely spread wireless connection protocol that is called upon to meet such demands. It operates in the internationally allocated, unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, & Medical (ISM) frequency spectrum. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), as a connectivity solution with high demands for power conservation accompanied with size limitation, can meet these demands. However, the lack of proven field data for BLE can be the root of uncertainties related to perceived quality of the interface. The main function of BLE in the H.A industry is to provide an audio and/or control interface between the Hearing aid and an external device. This function is investigated in this study. The mentioned function can be divided into 3 different operational modes; (I) pairing, (II) audio streaming and (III) control application. Some of the operational modes can potentially fail, while at the same time the rest remain operational. Since BLE has the aforementioned multistate functionality, the Markov process can be used to provide a practical approach for BLE functionality modeling. The method followed here is to group failure modes according to their severity ranks in the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) table. Accordingly, the transition from initial state means transitioning to higher severity in FMEA. Thereafter, the state transition rates can be obtained from the occurrence likelihood of the failure causes and their related detection likelihood. It is henceforth straightforward to solve the Markov chain by establishing the states matrix, the time dependent equations and steady state probabilities.

This trend is not only ongoing, it is further pushed by developments in the area of software stacks like the latest Bluetooth Low Energy Stack. It is also pushed by new chip-designs and powerful and highly integrated electronic hardware. The acceptance of wireless technologies as a possible solution for industrial applications, has overcome the entry barrier [1]. The first step to see wireless as standard for many industrial applications is almost accomplished. Nevertheless there is nearly none acceptance of wireless technology for Safety applications. One highly challenging and demanding requirement is still unsolved: The aspect safety and robustness. Those topics have been addressed in many cases but always in a similar manner. WirelessHART as an example addresses this topic with redundant so called multiple propagation paths and frequency hopping to handle with interferences and loss of network participants. So far the pure peer to peer link is rarely investigated and there are less safety solutions available. One product called LoRa T can be seen as one possible solution to address this lack of safety within wireless links. This paper focuses on the safety performance evaluation of a modem-chip-design. The use of diverse and redundant wireless technologies like LoRa can lead to an increase acceptance of wireless in safety applications. Many measurements in real industrial application have been carried out to be able to benchmark the new chip in terms of the safety aspects. The content of this research results can help to raise the level of confidence in wireless. In this paper, the term "safety" is used for data transmission reliability.

One of the key challenges when designing such applications is finding the right trade-off between a system's responsiveness and energy-efficiency. Although there exists research works that improve the performance of BLE communication, all these approaches focus on connection-based BLE. Most BLEbased applications, however, spend the majority of their time in connection-less device discovery, waiting for approaching users. The energy-efficiency and timeliness in this state are defined by parameters that are often statically set at compile time. Although supported by the BLE specifications, how to dynamically adapt these parameters to user behavior is still an open question. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and design a strategy to improve the energy-efficiency and responsiveness of BLE device discovery. Towards this goal, we model the device discovery process and identify its key parameters. We further design an adaptive advertising strategy that allows smart objects to adapt their device discovery parameters to the user behavior. We implement this adaptive strategy and measure its performance in a real-world application, the Nuki Smart Door Lock. Our experiments show that a smart lock using our strategy consumes 48% less energy while reducing the device discovery time by up to 63% compared to the use of static parameters. Furthermore, we discuss how nearby BLE devices can be used to inform the lock about approaching user devices and hence to improve its responsiveness in low-power phases even further.

The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power WideArea Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-toend LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.

Scalability problems may arise when the radio map is large, e.g., providing positioning in large geographical areas or involving crowdsourced data collection. Some researchers divide the radio map into smaller independent clusters, such that the search area is reduced to less dense groups than the initial database with similar features. Thus, the computational load in the operational stage is reduced both at the user devices and on servers. Nevertheless, the clustering models are machine-learning algorithms without specific domain knowledge on indoor positioning or signal propagation. This work proposes several clustering variants to optimize the coarse and fine-grained search and evaluates them over different clustering models and data sets. Moreover, we provide guidelines to obtain efficient and accurate positioning depending on the data set features. Finally, we show that the proposed new clustering variants reduce the execution time by half and the positioning error by approximate to 7% with respect to fingerprinting with the traditional clustering models.

In this study, we aim to develop a proximity-based localization system and show how its longitudinal deployment can provide operational insights related to staff and patients' mobility and room occupancy in clinical settings. Such a streamlined data-driven approach can help in increasing the uptime of operating rooms and more broadly provide an improved understanding of facility utilization. Objective: The aim of this study is to measure the accuracy of the system and algorithmically calculate measures of mobility and occupancy. Methods: We developed a Bluetooth low energy, proximity-based localization system and deployed it in a hospital for 30 days. The system recorded the position of 75 people (17 patients and 55 staff) during this period. In addition, we collected ground-truth data and used them to validate system performance and accuracy. A number of analyses were conducted to estimate how people move in the hospital and where they spend their time. Results: Using ground-truth data, we estimated the accuracy of our system to be 96%. Using mobility trace analysis, we generated occupancy rates for different rooms in the hospital occupied by both staff and patients. We were also able to measure how much time, on average, patients spend in different rooms of the hospital. Finally, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we showed that the system could differentiate between staff and patients without training. Conclusions: Analysis of longitudinal, location-based data can offer rich operational insights into hospital efficiency. In particular, they allow quick and consistent assessment of new strategies and protocols and provide a quantitative way to measure their effectiveness.

J	Zubov, D				Zubov, Dmytro			A Smart City Assistive Infrastructure for the Blind and Visually Impaired People: A Thin Client Concept	BRAIN-BROAD RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Smart City; Assistive Device; B&Vi People; Hog; Raspberry Pi 3 B		The World Health Organization pointed out that over 285 million people worldwide suffer from loss of vision and blindness, and that the number could drop drastically in just a few years. About 90 % of the blind and visually impaired (B&VI) live at a low income that means these people cannot buy the expensive assistive devices for the spatial cognition. In this work, the new concept of the smart city assistive infrastructure with distributed server-client architecture is presented for the B&VI using the inclusive smart assistive component that interacts with other subsystems of the smart city (smart buildings, smart mobility, smart energy, etc.) via IoT protocols such as MQTT. The main constituents of thin client are as follows: Raspberry Pi 3 B board with camera for the objects detection / recognition, ultrasonic sensor(s) HC-SR04 for the obstacles identification on the short-range distance up to 5 m, GPS module for the global navigation, iBeacon Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing software, MQTT IoT protocol for the mutual communication of clients, Python multithread application, Raspbian OS. The thin client hardware is of affordable price USD 70. The objects detection and recognition are implemented on the thin clients via the Histogram of Oriented Gradients with Euclidean distance classifier (HOG+EDC). The design of the recognition models, the file hosting of the training images and the knowledge base with the recognition rules are done on server(s). The modified Viola-Jones fast face detector with the combination of features "eye" and "nose" is proposed to speed up the image processing, but its detection rate is not 100 %. Hence, it can be applied only with the subsequent recognition using HOG+EDC.

But how does this affect learning on the job scenarios. The research project HANDELkompetent aims at digitization of work process integrated informal learning in retail with a methodological approach and a supporting digital learning environment. The method consists of an accompanied learning approach, where a dedicated person schedules the development of competences of staff in dialog. Learning content consists of small web-based trainings, i.e. learning-nuggets, which can be consumed in a few minutes. The learning environment is enhanced with a tablet pc app, which presents learning content to a learner. The app is enabled to deliver appropriate content to the learner by recognizing the learning situation by making use of device sensors, the actual competences of a learner and the target competences as registered in the learning environment. That means in detail that a learning position, e.g. cash point, warehouse or sales floor is tagged with iBeacons. Those iBeacons broadcast their identification via Bluetooth Low Energy. The tablet PC of a learner can identify these iBeacons and thus, the app determines the physical location of the learner. Besides the position the app can utilize microphone, camera or a brightness sensor for gathering context information, to derive the learning situation and to deliver appropriate content. We make use of the Digital Business Engineering Framework to structure our work. Digital Business Engineering is a methodological framework to deliver sustainable solutions for Digital Transformation. This paper shows our structural approach and first results of the development phase of the HANDELkompetent project. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These applications usually require a large coverage area and minimal operation and maintenance cost. To this end, the recently emerging backscatter communication (BC) is gaining interest in both industry and academia as a new communication paradigm that provides high energy efficient communications that may even work in a battery-less mode and, thus, it is well suited for smart city applications. However, the coverage of BC in urban area deployments is not available, and the feasibility of its utilization for smart city applications is not known. In this article, we present a comprehensive coverage study of a practical cellular carrier-based BC system for indoor and outdoor scenarios in a downtown area of a Helsinki city. In particular, we evaluate the coverage outage performance of different low-power and wide area technologies, i.e., long range (LoRa) backscatter, arrow band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT), and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based BC at different frequencies of operation. To do so, we carry out a comprehensive campaign of simulations while using a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) ray tracing (RT) tool, ITU outdoor model, and 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) indoor hotspot model. This study also covers the energy harvesting aspects of backscatter device, and it highlights the importance of future backscatter devices with high energy harvesting efficiency. The simulation results and discussion provided in this article will be helpful in understanding the coverage aspects of practical backscatter communication system in a smart city environment.

J	Tian, Y; Huang, BQ; Jia, B; Zhao, L				Tian, Yu; Huang, Baoqi; Jia, Bing; Zhao, Long			Optimizing AP and Beacon Placement in WiFi and BLE hybrid localization	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						AP and Beacon; WiFi and BLE Hybrid localization; Coverage; Differential evolution algorithm; Cramer-rao lower bound; Heterogeneous wireless networks		Nowadays, wireless communication techniques, such as WiFi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), etc., have been pervasive in our daily lives, and not only provide convenient data transmission services, but also enable popular indoor positioning and navigation services. The placement of wireless infrastructures like WiFi access points (APs) and BLE beacons have significant influences on the performance of localization. More importantly, since APs and beacons are probably used for both network access and localization, it is necessary to take into account both coverage and localization when deploying APs and beacons. In addition, there still exist other critical challenges, including optimizing AP and beacon placement in WiFi and BLE hybrid localization and optimizing the placement of extra APs and/or beacons in an existing wireless network, which are essentially NP-complete. This paper tackles these problems of optimizing AP and beacon placement by proposing a heuristic differential evolution algorithm based on the widely used Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To be specific, the CRLB is leveraged as a metric for localization and meanwhile a coverage degree criterion is defined as a metric for coverage, both of which are incorporated into the evaluation function of the differential evolution algorithm. Furthermore, instead of using the ideal log distance path loss (LDPL) model, the more practical Motley-Keenan model is adopted to reflect the influences of obstacles that are widespread in indoor environments. On these grounds, a software is designed and implemented based on Geotools to optimize AP and beacon placement in an interactive GUI manner. Finally, extensive simulations and field experiments are conducted, and a thorough comparison confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The proposed system includes a front-end device and a software system. The front-end device includes a solar charging circuit, a wireless charging circuit, and an analog front-end circuit. The analog front-end block is composed of an ECG sensing circuit, a microcontroller unit (MCU), and a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) module. This paper also proposes an iOS-based app with decision-tree model. Real-time ECG data are classified by the decision-tree model into different arrhythmias, and the average delay latency is 500 ms. Meanwhile, with 4G or Wi-Fi, the collected ECG data are uploaded to the cloud server for training the decision tree, and the coefficients of the pre-trained decision tree will be sent back to update the decision-tree model in the app. An accuracy of 98.22% is achieved. Through the proposed AIoT system, doctors and users can perform long-term ECG monitoring, which is valuable for cardiovascular-disease diagnosis. Doctors can also instantly assist users with the web-user interface to meet the needs of telemedicine. The proposed AIoT system is also used in human trials in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital.

The triple-mode power amplifier (PA) utilizes the adaptive gate splitting technique and free-wheeling control to achieve high efficiency in triple modes. The programmable supply voltage from two high-efficiency dc-dc converters supplies the PA. The output power of the PA is measured by the proposed high accuracy current sensor and controlled through different communication protocols depending on their operating standards. The WPC/PMA modes are based on the amplitude-shifting-key and frequency-shifting-key modulations for the communication between the transmitter and the receiver, while in the A4WP mode, to control the output power of the PA, the bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) unit adjusts the supply voltage through the provided step-up dc-dc converter. A step-down dc-dc converter with pulse-skipping modulation reduces the power consumption of the TWPTU during charge waiting time. The demodulator for in-band communication of WPC/PMA and interintegrated circuit for BLE communication of A4WP is fully implemented. This chip is fabricated using a 180-nm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process with laterally diffused mosfet options and has a die size of 5 x 3.5 mm. The proposed architecture achieves the output power level of 25.8 W. The measurement results show the maximum system efficiencies of the TWPTU in WPC/PMA and A4WP modes are 88.5% and 84.3%, respectively.

These systems leverage several technologies, such as computer-vision, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and other techniques to estimate the position of a user in indoor areas. Computer-vision based systems use several techniques including matching pictures, classifying captured images, recognizing visual objects or visual markers. BLE based system utilizes BLE beacons attached in the indoor areas as the source of the radio frequency signal to localize the position of the user. Methods: In this paper, we examine the performance and usability of two computer-vision based systems and BLE-based system. The first system is computer-vision based system, called CamNav that uses a trained deep learning model to recognize locations, and the second system, called QRNav, that utilizes visual markers (QR codes) to determine locations. A field test with 10 blindfolded users has been conducted while using the three navigation systems. Results: The obtained results from navigation experiment and feedback from blindfolded users show that QRNav and CamNav system is more efficient than BLE based system in terms of accuracy and usability. The error occurred in BLE based application is more than 30% compared to computer vision based systems including CamNav and QRNav. Conclusions: The developed navigation systems are able to provide reliable assistance for the participants during real time experiments. Some of the participants took minimal external assistance while moving through the junctions in the corridor areas. Computer vision technology demonstrated its superiority over BLE technology in assistive systems for people with visual impairments.

A between-group experimental design with 114 participants was conducted to test three groups; (1) a group using the mobile guide application as an information aid, (2) a control group (with no information aid), and (3) a group using pamphlets to explore the KOG. The Museum Experience Scale (MES) was used to evaluate visitors' experience for all participants, whilst the Multimedia Guide Scale (MMGS) was used to evaluate the visitors' experience with the mobile guide group. The most notable result from the Museum Experience Scale (MES) showed an impact on the visitors in terms of knowledge and learning when using the mobile guide application. However, the study found that enhancing visitors experience goes beyond simply providing interactive technologies in public settings to aid with information delivery. A limitation was providing relevant information in a timely and seamless manner due to inaccuracies of mapping between physical and digital environments. Future works should consider beacons and other Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to address the issues with location based devices. It is also important to highlight that the use of one's own device had a significant impact on learnability and control of the device, thus suggesting that the BYOD concept should be widely used in informal educational settings implementing mobile guide applications. The use of MES and MMGS informs future researches with an understanding of the different dimensions of visitors' experiences with mobile guide technology in public spaces to inform mobile application development that may further boost visitors' engagement, emotional connection, and meaningful experience.

However, central and peripheral nervous system trauma often decrease plantar cutaneous feedback and/or interneuronal excitability in processing the plantar cutaneous feedback. In this study, we tested a fully implantable neural recording and stimulation system augmenting plantar cutaneous feedback. Electromyograms were recorded from the medial gastrocnemius muscle for stance phase detection, while biphasic stimulation pulses were applied to the distal-tibial nerve during the stance phase to augment plantar cutaneous feedback. A Bluetooth low energy and a Qi-standard inductive link were adopted for wireless communication and wireless charging, respectively. To test the operation of the system, one intact rat walked on a treadmill with the electrical system implanted into its back. Leg kinematics were recorded to identify the stance phase. Stimulation was applied, with a 250-ms onset delay from stance onset and 200-ms duration, resulting in the onset at 47.58 +/- 2.82% of stance phase and the offset at 83.49 +/- 4.26% of stance phase (Mean +/- SEM). The conduction velocity of the compound action potential (31.2 m/s and 41.6 m/s at 1 center dot T and 2 center dot T, respectively) suggests that the evoked action potential was characteristic of an afferent volley for cutaneous feedback. We also demonstrated successful wireless charging and system reset functions. The experimental results suggest that the presented implantable system can be a valuable neural interface tool to investigate the effect of plantar cutaneous augmentation on gait in a rat model.

Piezologist is an unobtrusive chest worn device. It comprises a patch-type sensor and a mobile application. The sensor utilizes piezoelectric material as the cardiorespiratory signal sensing component and MetaWearC board as the signal acquisition unit. The board also comes with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support which is utilized for the raw signal transmission. The novelty aspect of the system rests on the fact that not only using a single cheap piezoelectric sheet common cardiorespiratory parameters (such as heart rate, respiration rate, and cycles) were obtained similar to previous studies but ECG waveform and blood pressure data were also extracted successfully using the same sensor. In addition, sensor packaging design and prototyping and their effect on the acquired signal strength on one hand and the package size (volume and weight) on the other hand were studied and reported. For performance validation purpose, the developed cardiorespiratory monitoring sensor system results were validated against two commercial sensor devices namely 3-lead ECG sensor from eHealth sensor kit and Zephyr belt-type BioHarness sensor, and the results were reported herein. The validation process outcomes confirmed that the cardiorespiratory signals extracted using Piezologist conform with a heartbeat, respiratory cycle and ECG waveform obtained using the commercial sensors. Furthermore, a usability study was conducted to compare the user experience offered by Piezologist against commercially available sensors for measuring cardiorespiratory parameters. The study highlighted the potential that Piezologist will take over the commercial available belt-type, watch-type and 3-lead ECG sensors.

J	Rashidibajgan, S; Hupperich, T				Rashidibajgan, Samaneh; Hupperich, Thomas			Improving the Performance of Opportunistic Networks in Real-World Applications Using Machine Learning Techniques	JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS			English	Article						opportunistic networks; selfish nodes; buffer size; nodes movement; nodes density		In Opportunistic Networks, portable devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables carried by individuals, can communicate and save-carry-forward their messages. The message transmission is often in the short range supported by communication protocols, such as Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Zigbee. These devices carried by individuals along with a city's taxis and buses represent network nodes. The mobility, buffer size, message interval, number of nodes, and number of messages copied in such a network influence the network's performance. Extending these factors can improve the delivery of the messages and, consequently, network performance; however, due to the limited network resources, it increases the cost and appends the network overhead. The network delivers the maximized performance when supported by the optimal factors. In this paper, we measured, predicted, and analyzed the impact of these factors on network performance using the Opportunistic Network Environment simulator and machine learning techniques. We calculated the optimal factors depending on the network features. We have used three datasets, each with features and characteristics reflecting different network structures. We collected the real-time GPS coordinates of 500 taxis in San Francisco, 320 taxis in Rome, and 196 public transportation buses in Munster, Germany, within 48 h. We also compared the network performance without selfish nodes and with 5%, 10%, 20%, and 50% selfish nodes. We suggested the optimized configuration under real-world conditions when resources are limited. In addition, we compared the performance of Epidemic, Prophet, and PPHB++ routing algorithms fed with the optimized factors. The results show how to consider the best settings for the network according to the needs and how self-sustaining nodes will affect network performance.

J	Matos, P; Rufino, J; Lopes, R				Matos, Paulo; Rufino, Jose; Lopes, Rui			An Architecture for Reliable Transportation of Delicate Goods	SENSORS			English	Article						transportation; delicate goods; IoT; ultra-low power; BLE; blockchain	NARROW-BAND INTERNET; WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS; COVID-19 VACCINES; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; THINGS	Adequate conditions are critical to avoiding damage or degradation of products during transportation, especially in the case of delicate goods like food products, live animals, precision machinery or art items, among others. The damages are not always readily identified: sometimes they are only detected several days or weeks after the merchandise has been delivered. Moreover, it may be hard to assess if the problems resulted from the transport conditions, and it may be even harder to prove it, making it difficult to determine and assign responsibilities. Also, transport is a global business, typically involving different companies and means (truck, train, plane, ship, horizontal ellipsis ). Usually, customers hire the service to a single commercial entity, but the service is performed by several companies, like transporters, stockists and dispatchers. To know whether the transport requirements are fulfilled or not is thus essential to assessing responsibilities and encouraging compliance by all the players in the process. In this paper, the authors propose an architecture that allows certifying, in an exempt manner, the conditions under which the transport of sensitive goods are carried out. In case of compliance, it protects the entities of the transport chain and ensures the customer that the merchandise has not been subject to conditions that may have affected its integrity or quality. If problems are detected, it allows to identify the non-compliant players and to assign responsibilities. The solution is based on ultra-low-power, low-cost devices (equipped with several sensors, a real-time clock, and Bluetooth Low Energy services), a mobile application and several cloud services (including a Coordinated Universal Time service).

Since WiFi and BLE work within the overlapped ISM 2.4 GHz band, they will interfere with each other. Existing approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in mitigating the interference. However, further performance improvement has been hampered by the design goal of exclusive communication of WiFi or BLE, which only allows one WiFi or BLE device to transmit packets at any specific time slot on the overlapped channel within the communication range. In this paper, we explore a new communication method, called Parallel Inclusive Communication (PIC), which leverages the unique modulation schemes of WiFi and BLE for parallel inclusive bi-directional transmission of both WiFi and BLE data at the same time within the overlapped channel. In this communication system, the PIC gateway is designed upon the IEEE 802.11g and 802.15.1 frameworks while the WiFi and BLE clients are commercial off-the-shelf devices. PIC achieves similar data rates for these parallel WiFi and BLE communications as if WiFi and BLE are communicating separately. PIC's system architecture naturally fits at the edge of the Internet, which is an optimal site for concurrently collecting (or disseminating) data from (or to) an exponentially increasing number of IoT devices that are using WiFi or BLE. We conducted extensive evaluations under four real-world scenarios. Results show that compared with existing approaches, PIC can significantly i) increase the packet reception ratios by 183%; ii) reduce the round-trip delay time by 590 times and energy consumption by 50.5 times; and iii) improve the throughput under WiFi and BLE coexistence scenarios.

Hospitals are of specific interest in this regard as the multitude of technical equipment used is potentially interfering with navigation systems. Objective This research examines relevant studies regarding Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) in hospitals and IPS that are designed for hospitals and in preparation for implementation, by investigating the respective technologies, techniques, prediction-improving methods, evaluation results, and limitations of the IPS. Methods To gather current and future IPS in hospitals, the methodology of a Scoping Review was used. The study has been conducted by applying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Framework to the context of IPS in hospitals. The results and limitations concerning current and future IPS in hospitals were gathered and structured by using a highly cited evaluation framework for IPS. Results Thirty-eight studies were considered for this research. The IPS technologies investigated were Bluetooth Low Energy (n = 17), Wireless-Fidelity (n = 10), Hybrids (n = 4), Radio-Frequency Identification (n = 4), Ultra-Wideband (n = 1), Infrared (n = 1) and ZigBee (n = 1). Conclusions This study presents current and future IPS in hospitals. For future IPS research and IPS in hospitals, the theoretical implications contribute to our knowledge about IPS technologies, techniques, prediction-improving methods, evaluation results and limitations during testing/implementing IPS in hospitals. As practical implications, the insights of this study can be used by developers to improve IPS and by hospitals to facilitate IPS implementation.

This article presents and analyzes the tradeoffs between the energies required for communication and computation in a wireless sensor network, deployed in a mesh architecture over a 2400-acre university campus, and is targeted toward multisensor measurement of temperature, humidity and water nitrate concentration for smart agriculture. Several scenarios involving in-sensor analytics (ISA), collaborative intelligence (CI), and context-aware switching (CAS) of the cluster head during CI has been considered. A real-time co-optimization algorithm has been developed for minimizing the energy consumption in the network, hence maximizing the overall battery lifetime. Measurement results show that the proposed ISA consumes approximate to 467x lower energy as compared to traditional Bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication, and approximate to 69 500x lower energy as compared with long-range (LoRa) communication. When the ISA is implemented in conjunction with LoRa, the lifetime of the node increases from a mere 4.3 h to 66.6 days with a 230-mAh coin cell battery, while preserving >99% of the total information. The CI and CAS algorithms help in extending the worst case node lifetime by an additional 50%, thereby exhibiting an overall network lifetime of approximate to 104 days, which is >90% of the theoretical limits as posed by the leakage current present in the system, while effectively transferring information sampled every second. A Web-based monitoring system was developed to continuously archive the measured data, and for reporting real-time anomalies.

Carmen			Providing interoperability in Bluetooth mesh with an improved provisioning protocol	WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						Bluetooth mesh; Provisioning; Heterogeneous networks; Interoperability; Lightweight provisioning	INTERNET; THINGS	Different versions of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) have been standardized with point-to-point and broadcast topologies. Recently Bluetooth mesh specification provides BLE with mesh topology, highly demanded by Internet of Things (IoT) and numerous applications such as smart cities or Industry 4.0. Bluetooth mesh emerges as one of the most promising low-power IoT standards, enabling many-to-many device communications and optimising the deployment of large-scale device networks. Our research focuses on addressing the significant real-life problem of interoperability, the integration of devices with different topologies and versions of BLE to permit mesh transmissions. This integration will permit to increase the coverage area, to diminish important drawbacks in communication and power consumption and to save money by reducing the number of new devices. We have implemented and evaluated the Bluetooth mesh and the provisioning procedure, which provides network devices with all the necessary data to communicate with the rest of devices in the mesh network. Moreover, the Lightweight Provisioning, our proposal to improve the provisioning procedure, is presented. Our implementation allows Bluetooth non-mesh devices to be provisioned and to take part in a Bluetooth mesh network, making possible to continue using current devices. Performance was evaluated by a set of experiments across two steps: First, the provisioning time was measured for different configurations, including our proposal. Second, we measured the end-to-end delay and the packet reception rate in the lowest compatible BLE version. This work demonstrates real interoperability among devices with different BLE versions, a low end-to-end delay in a small and medium-scale mesh networks and a high packet reception rate for advertising intervals greater than 100 ms.

GNSS is commonly used in outdoor positioning. However, it is sometimes difficult to receive GNSS signals in the room because the satellite signals are easily blocked. It is extremely important to find the indoor location method. At the same time, the comprehensive use of intelligent mobile terminal makes people's daily life more and more convenient. Intelligent mobile terminals contain a large number of sensors. We can calculate the location of the target and complete the indoor location of intelligent mobile terminals with these sensors and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device. Due to the current indoor map data collection is not only a heavy workload but also a low efficiency, Building Information Model (BIM) is one of the key technologies to solve the indoor map data collection and visualization in the indoor location of the intelligent mobile terminal. In this paper, intelligent mobile terminal indoor positioning technology based on BIM and BLE technology is introduced innovatively to solve the GNSS cannot be applied to the positioning of the indoor environment problems and the establishment of internal architecture in mobile intelligent terminal positioning model. Relying on this technology, the intelligent mobile terminal indoor positioning platform has been developed to realize the three-dimensional positioning of the intelligent mobile terminal. Experimental results show that the BIM and intelligent mobile terminal can be combined successfully and the accuracy of indoor location is the average value of X coordinate direction error is 1.417m, the average value of Y coordinate direction error is 1.530m, and the Z coordinate direction error average value is 1.452m.

Use of Inertial Dead Reckoning and Activity Recognition to Enable Always-On, Low-Power Contextually Aware Applications in Mobile Devices	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS 2014)	Institute of Navigation Satellite Division Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	27th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS)	SEP 08-12, 2014	Tampa, FL	Inst Navigat, Satellite Div				Location technologies in smart mobile devices are being utilized not only in traditional foreground applications such as maps and navigation, but also now in a new array of background tracking applications. In foreground applications, location and navigation accuracy is key. The power consumption of the foreground application is less of a concern since the screen of the mobile device is on and dominating the battery usage. In background applications, the device screen and many other system resources are powered down, so priorities shift more toward conserving power of any remaining active applications. One important emerging background application is user context, commonly referred to as "contextual awareness". Contextually-aware mobile applications try to identify three key pieces of information: 1) Where am I? (location); 2) What am I doing? (activity); and 3) Who/What am I close to? (proximity) In order to extract the most value from this feature, app developers and service providers seek to leave the context application "always-on". Inertial sensing solutions play a key role in determining the location and activity parameters of context, not only improving accuracy and coverage, but they also help to reduce overall system power as part of a hybrid location solution with WiFi, GNSS, and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE). In contrast to traditional foreground location applications, user context tracking is on all the time and focuses more on coverage versus navigation. In many cases, coarse location (less accuracy) is acceptable in exchange for more efficient power consumption. This paper outlines the characteristics of a background context tracking implementation covering not only robust, low-power inertial dead reckoning, but also user activity classification.

Wireless, soft electronics for rapid, multisensor measurements of hydration levels in healthy and diseased skin	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						wireless electronics; flexible electronics; biomedical devices; health monitoring; diagnostics	TRANSEPIDERMAL WATER-LOSS; ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; GUIDELINES	Precise, quantitative measurements of the hydration status of skin can yield important insights into dermatological health and skin structure and function, with additional relevance to essential processes of thermoregulation and other features of basic physiology. Existing tools for determining skin water content exploit surrogate electrical assessments performed with bulky, rigid, and expensive instruments that are difficult to use in a repeatable manner. Recent alternatives exploit thermal measurements using soft wireless devices that adhere gently and noninvasively to the surface of the skin, but with limited operating range (similar to 1 cm) and high sensitivity to subtle environmental fluctuations. This paper introduces a set of ideas and technologies that overcome these drawbacks to enable high-speed, robust, long-range automated measurements of thermal transport properties via a miniaturized, multisensor module controlled by a long-range (similar to 10 m) Bluetooth Low Energy system on a chip, with a graphical user interface to standard smartphones. Soft contact to the surface of the skin, with almost zero user burden, yields recordings that can be quantitatively connected to hydration levels of both the epidermis and dermis, using computational modeling techniques, with high levels of repeatability and insensitivity to ambient fluctuations in temperature. Systematic studies of polymers in layered configurations similar to those of human skin, of porcine skin with known levels of hydration, and of human subjects with benchmarks against clinical devices validate the measurement approach and associated sensor hardware. The results support capabilities in characterizing skin barrier function, assessing severity of skin diseases, and evaluating cosmetic and medication efficacy, for use in the clinic or in the home.

Design and Practical Evaluation of a Family of Lightweight Protocols for Heterogeneous Sensing through BLE Beacons in IoT Telemetry Applications	SENSORS			English	Article						BLE; beacon; lightweight protocol; plug-and-play; smart sensors; IoT; WoT; telemetry; Eddystone	SMART CITIES; INTERNET; THINGS; ENERGY	The Internet of Things (IoT) involves a wide variety of heterogeneous technologies and resource-constrained devices that interact with each other. Due to such constraints, IoT devices usually require lightweight protocols that optimize the use of resources and energy consumption. Among the different commercial IoT devices, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based beacons, which broadcast periodically certain data packets to notify their presence, have experienced a remarkable growth, specially due to their application in indoor positioning systems. This article proposes a family of protocols named Lightweight Protocol for Sensors (LP4S) that provides fast responses and enables plug-and-play mechanisms that allow IoT telemetry systems to discover new nodes and to describe and auto-register the sensors and actuators connected to a beacon. Thus, three protocols are defined depending on the beacon hardware characteristics: LP4S-6 (for resource-constraint beacons), LP4S-X (for more powerful beacons) and LP4S-J (for beacons able to run complex firmware). In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the designed protocols, the most restrictive (LP4S-6) is tested after implementing it for a telemetry application in a beacon based on Eddystone (Google's open beacon format). Thus, the beacon specification is extended in order to increase its ability to manage unlimited sensors in a telemetry system without interfering in its normal operation with Eddystone frames. The performed experiments show the feasibility of the proposed solution and its superiority, in terms of latency and energy consumption, with respect to approaches based on Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) when multiple users connect to a mote or in scenarios where latency is not a restriction, but where low-energy consumption is essential.

Unsupervised neural network-enabled spatial-temporal analytics for data authenticity under environmental smart reporting system	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						ESG reporting; Internet of Things; Blockchain; Data authenticity; Anomaly detection; Spatial-temporal analytics	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY	Environment, social and governance (ESG) disclosures required on listed companies have aroused considerable interest in both academia and industry for sustainable development and investing. However, the authenticity and credibility of the ESG report exposed to the public remain in doubt due to black box-like reporting processes with massive human involvements. In this study, a framework of environmental smart reporting system (BI-ESRS) based on the blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is developed to automate the acquisition of environment-related data and make the reporting reliable and traceable. In addition, we evaluate the authenticity of the data collected from IoT devices, considering human-made counterfeits on measuring instruments for greenwashing. It is anticipated to stimulate companies to submit high-quality data without fake. Specifically, an unsupervised neural network-enabled spatial-temporal analytics (UN-STA) method is devised to achieve anomalies detection and index the data with an authenticity rate. An artificial neural network, self-organizing map (SOM), is applied to construct the prediction model. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth low energy (BLE), the vibration amplitude of smart instruments and data uploading interval constitute the input vector for competitive learning. Finally, an experimental simulation is carried out to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed system and method, and their effectiveness has also been testified. Moreover, the sensitivity of the SOM model over the three factors has been analyzed by applying the control variate technique. This work is expected to serve as a reference for practitioners to satisfy similar requirements in the industry and inspire new ideas for scholars.0 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While security of the messages is guaranteed thought standard encryption techniques, little has been done in terms of actively protecting the overall network in case of attacks aiming to undermine its integrity. Although many network analysis and risk mitigation techniques are currently available, they require considerable amounts of data coming from both legitimate and attack scenarios to sufficiently discriminate among them, which often turns into the requirement of a complete description of the traffic flowing through the network. Furthermore, there are no publicly available datasets to this extent for BLE mesh networks, due most to the novelty of the standard and to the absence of specific implementation tools. To create a reliable mechanism of network analysis suited for BLE in this paper we propose a machine learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on pattern classification and recognition of the most classical denial of service attacks affecting this kind of networks, working on a single internal node, thus requiring a small amount of information to operate. Moreover, in order to overcome the gap created by the absence of data, we present our data collection system based on ESP32 that allowed the collection of the packets from the Network and the Model layers of the BLE Mesh stack, together with a set of experiments conducted to get the necessary data to train the IDS. In the last part, we describe some preliminary results obtained by the experimental setups, focusing on its strengths, as well as on the aspects where further analysis is required, hence proposing some improvements of the classification model as future work.

J	Ung, SJ; Ab Rahman, A				Ung, Shen Jie; Ab Rahman, Ab Al-Hadi			A 88 mu W digital phase-domain GFSK demodulator compatible with low-IF and zero-IF receiver with preamble detection for BLE	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Bluetooth; BLE; GFSK; demodulator	ADC; OFFSET	Unlike conventional analog-to-digital converter (ADC), phase-domain ADC (Ph-ADC) is more power efficient for the implementation of fully digital Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) demodulator in bluetooth low energy (BLE). Besides, Ph-ADC based demodulator is flexible to pair with low-IF and zero-IF receiver, opposed to limiter based demodulator that work with low-IF receiver only. Yet, currently reported Ph-ADC based demodulator lack of preamble detection for BLE which will be used as symbol clock synchronization. In this work, a Ph-ADC based demodulator is proposed with the feature of preamble detection on BLE's packet. The detected preamble is used for symbol clock recovery and compensation of carrier frequency offset in a BLE packet. Besides, the proposed demodulator is flexible to demodulate IF or baseband signal by simply configuring a parameter value. Using MATLAB, minimum signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR) needed to demodulate BLE packet is estimated using Monte Carlo simulation with 99% confidence level. For hardware implementation, the proposed demodulator is implemented at RTL in Synopsys and its layout is generated using 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. To understand the trade-off between power consumption, layout size and minimum SNR needed, the proposed Ph-ADC based demodulator is scaled to a different combination of 4-bit to 6-bit resolution and 2 MHz to 16 MHz sampling rate. Configuration with the best trade-off for the proposed Ph-ADC demodulator can achieve bit error rate (BER) of 0.1% at SNR of 12.5 dB and able to tolerate carrier frequency offset of +/- 200 kHz while using only half the power needed by state of the art limiter based demodulator.

We prepared a porous poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (p-PTFE) film with a thickness of 12 mu m and an average pore size of 0.7 mu m sandwiched by two films of tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) with a thickness of 6 mu m (FEP/p-PTFE/FEP film) as an electret film used for the energy-harvesting device. A corona discharge system used to fabricate an FEP/p-PTFE/FEP film with an area of 20 x 20 cm(2) that generates piezoelectricity (electret FEP/p-PTFE/FEP film). The electret FEP/p-PTFE/FEP film had a piezoelectric constant d(33) of more than 100 pC/N. Then, we fabricated a multilayer film by stacking the metal foil and the electret FEP/p-PTFE/FEP film without forming wrinkles or streaks. The voltage, current, and power generated by the electret FEP/p-PTFE/FEP multilayer film during an exercise involving a research subject repeatedly stepping on the film placed in the floor were evaluated. The maximum instantaneous generated power was about 4500 mu W each time the subject stamped up and down. The energy consumed in transmitting an 8-byte signal using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device is known to be about 600 mu W. Considering the electricity consumption of BLE devices, the above result strongly indicates that the power generated by the electret FEP/p-PTFE/FEP multilayer film has great potential for use in BLE devices.

A single-channel phase-tracking RX based on a sliding-IF phase-to-digital conversion (SIF-PDC) loop is proposed to directly demodulate and digitize the frequency/phase-modulated information. The sliding-IF frequency plan reduces the power consumption of the multi-phase LO generation. A phase rotator is adopted in SIF-PDC to guarantee frequency stability, i.e., avoid the frequency pulling by interference or frequency drift. It equivalently transforms the RF signal processing from the I/Q amplitude domain to a digital-phase domain, which saves up to nearly 40% on power consumption and relaxes the digital baseband complexity. A phase-domain linear model of the proposed SIF-PDC is presented to analyze the frequency response. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS technology, the presented RX consumes 2.4 mW at 2Mbps data rate, i.e., 1.2 nJ/b efficiency, and achieves a sensitivity of -92 dBm.

Many countries are now generating audible signals at crossings for visually impaired people to help with this problem. However, these accessible pedestrian signals can result in confusion for visually impaired people as they do not know which signal must be interpreted for traveling multiple crosses in complex road architecture. To solve this problem, we propose an assistive system called CAS (Crossing Assistance System) which extends the principle of the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) signal for outdoor and indoor location tracking and overcomes the intrinsic limitation of outdoor noise to enable us to locate the user effectively. We installed the system on a real-world intersection and collected a set of data for demonstrating the feasibility of outdoor RSSI tracking in a series of two studies. In the first study, our goal was to show the feasibility of using outdoor RSSI on the localization of four zones. We used a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method and showed it led to 99.8% accuracy. In the second study, we extended our work to a more complex setup with nine zones, evaluated both the kNN and an additional method, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with various RSSI features for classification. We found that the SVM performed best using the RSSI average, standard deviation, median, interquartile range (IQR) of the RSSI over a 5 s window. The best method can localize people with 97.7% accuracy.

J	Leith, DJ; Farrell, S				Leith, Douglas J.; Farrell, Stephen			Coronavirus Contact Tracing: Evaluating The Potential Of Using Bluetooth Received Signal Strength For Proximity Detection	ACM SIGCOMM COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW			English	Article						Bluetooth LE; Contact Tracing; Covid-19		Many countries are deploying Covid-19 contact tracing apps that use Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) to detect proximity within 2m for 15 minutes. However, Bluetooth LE is an unproven technology for this application, raising concerns about the efficacy of these apps. Indeed, measurements indicate that the Bluetooth LE received signal strength can be strongly affected by factors including (i) the model of handset used, (ii) the relative orientation of handsets, (iii) absorption by human bodies, bags etc. and (iv) radio wave reflection from walls, floors, furniture. The impact on received signal strength is comparable with that caused by moving 2m, and so has the potential to seriously affect the reliability of proximity detection. These effects are due the physics of radio propagation and suggest that the development of accurate methods for proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal strength is likely to be challenging. We call for action in three areas. Firstly, measurements are needed that allow the added value of deployed apps within the overall contact tracing system to be evaluated, e.g. data on how many of the people notified by the app would not have been found by manual contact tracing and what fraction of people notified by an app actually test positive for Covid-19. Secondly, the 2m/15 minute proximity limit is only a rough guideline. The real requirement is to use handset sensing to evaluate infection risk and this requires a campaign to collect measurements of both handset sensor data and infection outcomes. Thirdly, a concerted effort is needed to collect controlled Bluetooth LE measurements in a wide range of real-world environments, the data reported here being only a first step in that direction.

J	Park, DH; Oh, ST; Lim, JH				Park, Dae-Hwan; Oh, Seung-Taek; Lim, Jae-Hyun			Development of a UV Index Sensor-Based Portable Measurement Device with the EUVB Ratio of Natural Light	SENSORS			English	Article						UV; portable measurement device; EUVB ratio; erythema weight; UV index sensor	SKIN-CANCER; SUNLIGHT; SOLAR	Ultraviolet (UV) rays are electromagnetic waves that account for about 5% of solar light, and when overexposed, they pose malevolent effects on human skin and health. However, with recent reports on the beneficial effects of some wavelength bands of UV rays, people's interest in UV information has increased. This has resulted in requiring not just simple information, such as the amount of UV or UV index (UVI), but detailed UV information that directly affects health, such as EUVB (erythemally weighted UVB). However, calculating EUVB, which can be done by applying the erythemal weighted function on the intensity value in wavelength, requires specialized optical measurement devices, which cannot be easily accessed by the general public; furthermore, public institutions' UV information services do not offer EUVB information for individuals. Therefore, the present study proposes a UVI sensor-based portable measurement device, with which the general public can have easy access to UV-related information. The proposed device comprises a UVI sensor that can measure the intensity of erythemal UV radiation, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module that supports communication, and a micro controller unit (MCU) for key operations. In addition, it applies the ratio of EUVB by month/time, resulting from the actual analysis of natural light to calculate the EUVB and provides the amount of UVI and EUVB to check if they meet conditions required for outdoor activities through the device and smartphone applications. The applicability of the proposed device was verified by the measurement performance comparison test with the standard device, a spectrometer (CAS 140 CT), which showed an average error of 0.045 for UVI and 0.0014 W/m(2). The proposed device's offering of UV-related information such as UVI and EUVB to the user is expected to prevent potential damage due to exposure to UV and to support healthy outdoor activities.

Internet on animals: Wi-Fi-enabled devices provide a solution for big data transmission in biologging	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						animal movement; embedded systems; Internet of Things; open source; sensing; telemetry; wireless sensor networks	GPS TRACKING; GOLDEN-AGE; FRONTIERS; MOVEMENT; SUCCESS; LIMITS; COULD	Biologging devices are deployed on animals to collect ultra-fine-scale movement data that reveal subsecond patterns in locomotion or long-term patterns in motion and space use. Often these two data types, although complementary, are rarely collected within the same study, given the limiting factors of memory space, power requirements and the need to retrieve stored data from animals. Biologging requires a revolutionary advancement in data networking to overcome these restrictions that constrain big data collection; for the continuous recording and remote download of fine-scale movement and environmental data, from long-term deployments and multiple individuals. Here, we adopt a strategy from the Internet of Things and develop the use of Wi-Fi as a solution for big data biologging. Our 'WildFi' tag uses pre-existing, or easy-to-set-up, infrastructure in smartphones and Wi-Fi gateways. We demonstrate the power of memory management and an embedded modular software architecture for functionality, including collective data retrieval at multiple gateways. We find that Wi-Fi, together with smart embedded software, increases the retrieval efficiency of biologging data by orders of magnitude compared to other available systems: with a transmission speed of 230 kByte/s and range of <= 200 m that is 11 times faster than Bluetooth low energy and >3000 times faster than LoRaWAN. Case studies on a domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), aviary-housed cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) and free-roaming pangolins (Smutsia temminckii) demonstrate the functionality of the WildFi tag for remote and robust autonomous Wi-Fi data transmission under a range of conditions. Modularity in software and hardware allows for project-specific tailoring beyond reconfiguring sampling parameters of a biologger, which we encourage with open-source sharing of our architecture design. Enhanced communication between animal-attached devices, Wi-Fi infrastructure and smartphones, alongside smart and collaborative data retrieval, eases restrictions for big data collection in animal ecology.

The agriculture field is also affected by these technological advances, resulting in better water and fertilizers' usage and so huge improvements of both quality and yield of the crops. In this manuscript, the development of an IoT-based smart traceability and farm management system is described, which calibrates the irrigations and fertigation operations as a function of crop typology, growth phase, soil and environment parameters and weather information; a suitable software architecture was developed to support the system decision-making process, also based on data collected on-field by a properly designed solar-powered wireless sensor network (WSN). The WSN nodes were realized by using the ESP8266 NodeMCU module exploiting its microcontroller functionalities and Wi-Fi connectivity. Thanks to a properly sized solar power supply system and an optimized scheduling scheme, a long node autonomy was guaranteed, as experimentally verified by its power consumption measures, thus reducing WSN maintenance. In addition, a literature analysis on the most used wireless technologies for agri-food products' traceability is reported, together with the design and testing of a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) low-cost sensor tag to be applied into the containers of agri-food products, just collected from the fields or already processed, to monitor the main parameters indicative of any failure or spoiling over time along the supply chain. A mobile application was developed for monitoring the tracking information and storing conditions of the agri-food products. Test results in real-operative scenarios demonstrate the proper operation of the BLE smart tag prototype and tracking system.

Technical Features and Functionalities of Myo Armband: An Overview on Related Literature and Advanced Applications of Myoelectric Armbands Mainly Focused on Arm Prostheses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SMART SENSING AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electronic modules; IoT applications; myoelectric signals; prosthesis; wireless connectivity		Technological advances in manufacturing smart high-performances electronic devices, increasingly available at lower costs, nowadays allow one to improve users' quality of life in many application fields. In this work, the human-machine interaction obtained by using a next generation device (Myo armband) is analyzed and discussed, with a particular focus to healthcare applications such as upper-limb prostheses. An overview on application fields of the Myo armband and on the latest research works related to its use in prosthetic applications is presented; subsequently, the technical features and functionalities of this device are examined. Myo armband is a wearable device provided with eight electromyographic electrodes, a 9-axes inertial measurement unit and a transmission module. It sends the data related to the detected signals, via Bluetooth Low Energy technology, to other electronic devices which process them and act accordingly, depending on how they are programmed (in order to drive actuators or perform other specific functions). Applied to the prosthetic field, Myo armband allows one to overcome many issues related to the existing prostheses, representing a complete electronic platform that detects in real-time the main signals related to forearm activity (muscles activation and forearm movements in the three-dimensional space) and sends these data to the connected devices. Nowadays, several typologies of prostheses are available on the market; they can be mainly distinguished into low-cost prostheses, which are light and compact but allow for a limited number of movements, and high-end prostheses, which are much more complex and featured by high dexterity, but also heavy, bulky, difficult to control and very expensive. Finally, the Myo armband is an optimum candidate for prosthetic application (and many others) and offers an excellent low-cost solution for obtaining a reliable, easy to use system.

Among many platforms that need to be localized and tracked are pedestrians. A reliable indoor pedestrians tracking has a wide range of applications such as healthcare, retail, rescue missions and context-awareness applications. This paper introduces a calibration-free hybrid indoor positioning system that utilizes inertial sensors (INS), wireless local area networks (WLAN), and low-cost Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) wireless beacons. BLE beacons are becoming very popular in retails and they can be easily installed in any indoor environment. To deal with jumpy and noisy nature of wireless positioning indoors, and to cancel out the unbounded drifts associated with INS, this work investigates the utilization of Grid-based nonlinear Bayesian filtering to fuse all the aforementioned sensors measurements. The motion-updated prior is modeled as a probability distribution (PD) that takes discrete values (cells) with a pre-defined resolution. This prior PD is shaped by the pedestrian dead-reckoning model (PDR). The measurements-updated posterior PD is calculated using a numerical approximation of Bayes' rule where measurements are signal strength observations. The measurement model is mainly a tightly-coupled model where all motion states, sensors errors, and wireless propagation models are represented. To further enhance the accuracy, all RSS measurements are filtered out by a separate Kalman filter with a Gauss-Markov process model. The performance is further enhanced by applying measurements updates from BLE beacons. The system is realized on an experimental setup that consists of off-the-shelf INS existing on smart-phone and WiFi. For flexibility and analysis purposes, the BLE beacons were simulated on top of the collected INS/WiFi measurements. The ground-truth was obtained by an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped by INS and Odometer aided by floor maps.

Such a platform can enable the expansion of IoT for environmental and lifestyle applications. Here we report a platform capable of acquiring currents ranging from 1.5 nA to 7.2 mu A full-scale with 20-bit resolution and variable sampling rates of up to 3.125 kSPS. In addition, it features a bipolar voltage programmable in the range of -10 V to +5 V with a 3.65 mV resolution. A Finite State Machine steers the system by executing a set of embedded functions. The FSM allows for dynamic, customized adjustments of the nanosensor bias, including elevated bias schemes for self-heating, measurement range, bandwidth, sampling rate, and measurement time intervals. Furthermore, it enables data logging on external memory (SD card) and data transmission over a Bluetooth low energy connection. The average power consumption of the platform is 64.5 mW for a measurement protocol of three samples per second, including a BLE advertisement of a 0 dBm transmission power. A state-of-the-art (SoA) application of the platform performance using a CNT nanosensor, exposed to NO2 gas concentrations from 200 ppb down to 1 ppb, has been demonstrated. Although sensor signals are measured for NO2 concentrations of 1 ppb, the 3 sigma limit of detection (LOD) of 23 ppb is determined (1 sigma: 7 ppb) in slope detection mode, including the sensor signal variations in repeated measurements. The platform's wide current range and high versatility make it suitable for signal acquisition from resistive nanosensors such as silicon nanowires, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other 2D materials. Along with its overall low power consumption, the proposed platform is highly suitable for various sensing applications within the context of IoT.

J	Li, N; Liu, H; Abdolmalaki, RY; Mancini, GJ; Tan, JD				Li, Ning; Liu, Hui; Abdolmalaki, Reza Yazdanpanah; Mancini, Gregory J.; Tan, Jindong			s-CAM: An Untethered Insertable Laparoscopic Surgical Camera Robot with Non-Contact Actuation	SENSORS			English	Article						insertable laparoscopic camera; robotic-assisted surgery; minimally invasive surgery; medical robotics	IN-VIVO; SURGERY; SYSTEM; CHOLECYSTECTOMY; FUTURE	Fully insertable robotic imaging devices represent a promising future of minimally invasive laparoscopic vision. Emerging research efforts in this field have resulted in several proof-of-concept prototypes. One common drawback of these designs derives from their clumsy tethering wires which not only cause operational interference but also reduce camera mobility. In this paper, a tetherless insertable surgical camera (s-CAM) robot with non-contact transabdominal actuation is presented for single-incision laparoscopic vision. Wireless video transmission and control communication using onboard power help eliminate cumbersome tethering wires. Furthermore, magnetic based camera actuation gets rid of intrinsic physical constraints of mechanical driving mechanisms, thereby improving camera mobility and reducing operational interference. In addition, a custom Bluetooth low energy (BLE) application profile and a real-time operating system (RTOS) based multitask programming framework are also proposed to facilitate embedded software design for insertable medical devices. Initial ex vivo test results of the s-CAM design have demonstrated technical feasibility of a tetherless insertable laparoscopic camera. Effective imaging is confirmed at as low as 500 lx illumination. Wireless laparoscopic vision is accessible within a distance of more than 10 m. Transabdominal BLE communication is stable at over -52 dBm and shows its potential for wireless control of insertable medical devices. RTOS based sfotware event response is bounded within 1 ms while the CPU usage is at 3 similar to 5%. The device is able to work for 50 min with its onboard power.

Smartphone App-Enabled Flex sEMG Patch using FOWLP	IEEE 72ND ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (ECTC 2022)	Electronic Components and Technology Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	72nd IEEE Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)	MAY 31-JUN 01, 2022	San Diego, CA	IEEE		wireless sEMG; electromyography		Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a technique in which electrodes placed on the surface of the skin record electric signals from muscle contraction. Data collected by the sEMG is instrumental in the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular diseases. Traditional sEMG systems require many wires and a complex setup. We have demonstrated a flexible sEMG called FlexsEMG that wirelessly transmits data through an embedded Bluetooth low energy (BLE) chip. FlexsEMG is based on the FlexTrate(tm) process. It utilizes die-first flexible fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP) and solderless integration of bare dielets at 20-40 tun pad pitches, allowing the device to bend to radii as small as 1 mm. The wireless setup enables a broader range of clinical applications at a lower cost. Previously, reported data was collected from a single subject and single device through a desktop computer and the data could not be displayed or processed in real time [D. In this paper, we demonstrate: the prototyping of several FlexsEMG devices to evaluate repeatability of the process and identify potential problems; a newly developed mobile app to receive and display signals transmitted from our FlexsEMG devices in real time. We used this setup to collect data in real time from several participants with multiple devices demonstrating repeatability of the process and robustness of our devices. Further, our app allows the user to process the data after measurement and adjust any signal processing parameters as needed. Most importantly, it allows the use of the device in an ambulatory mode. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our FlexsEMG platform to wirelessly collect sEMG data from multiple subjects performing a variety of physical activities with minimal setup time and complexity, suggesting consumer usage potential.

For understanding worker movements in dynamic construction environments which involve moving and changing objects, a system named 'WoTAS' (Worker Trajectory Analysis System) is proposed. First, a real-time Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons-based data collection and trajectory pre-processing subsystem is built for extracting multifaceted trajectory characteristics and stay regions of the workers that will help in recognizing the important regions in the building for categorizing the worker movements. Second, to enable the desired semantic insights for better understanding the underlying meaningful worker movements using the contextual data repositories related to the building environment, an ontology-based 'STriDE' (Semantic Trajectories for Dynamic Environments) model is applied which tracks the evolution of moving and changing building objects and outputs semantic trajectories. For extracting insights from the semantic trajectories, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used which is one of the probabilistic approaches present in the literature for describing the object behavior in time. Using the HMMs, a set of trajectories belonging to a stay region is analyzed by categorizing the worker movements into four different states. In the end, the output of the Viterbi algorithm is visualized using a BIM model for identifying the most probable high-risk locations involving sharp worker movements and rotations. The developed 'WoTAS' system will help safety managers in monitoring and controlling building activities remotely in dynamic environments by understanding the worker movements for improved safety management in day-to-day building operations. Eventually, understanding the worker movements will contribute towards reducing the chances of near-miss incidents on sites which have the potential to cause serious accidents.

We develop a two-fold solution, based on micro-services for the IoT (users' smart devices) and the cloud side (back-end services). iTaaS includes configurations for (a) the IoT side to support data collection from IoT devices to a gateway on a real time basis and, (b) the cloud back-end side to support data sharing, storage and processing. iTaaS provides the technology foreground to enable immediate application deployments in the domain of interest. An obvious and promising implementation of this technology is e-Health and remote health monitoring. As a proof of concept we implement a real time remote patient monitoring system that integrates the proposed framework and uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pulse oximeter and heart rate monitoring sensing devices. The experimental analysis shows fast data collection, as (for our experimental setup) data is transmitted from the IoT side (i.e. the gateway) to the cloud in less than 130 ms. We also stress the back-end system with high user concurrency (e.g. with 40 users per second) and high data streams (e.g. 240 data records per second) and we show that the requests are executed at around 1 s, a number that signifies a satisfactory performance by considering the number of requests, the network latency and the relatively small size of the Virtual Machines implementing services on the cloud (2 GB RAM, 1 CPU and 20 GB hard disk size).

In this paper, we present the Acoustic Location Processing System (ALPS), a platform that augments BLE transmitters with ultrasound in a manner that improves ranging accuracy and can help users configure indoor localization systems with minimal effort. A user places three or more beacons in an environment and then walks through a calibration sequence with their mobile device where they touch key points in the environment like the floor and the corners of the room. This process automatically computes the room geometry as well as the precise beacon locations without needing auxiliary measurements. Once configured, the system can track a user's location referenced to a map. The platform consists of time-synchronized ultrasonic transmitters that utilize the bandwidth just above the human hearing limit, where mobile devices are still sensitive and can detect ranging signals. To aid in the mapping process, the beacons perform inter-beacon ranging during setup. Each beacon includes a BLE radio that can identify and trigger the ultrasonic signals. By using differences in propagation characteristics between ultrasound and radio, the system can classify if beacons are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) to the mobile phone. In cases where beacons are blocked, we show how the phone's inertial measurement sensors can be used to supplement localization data. We experimentally evaluate that our system can estimate three-dimensional beacon location with a Euclidean distance error of 16.1cm, and can generate maps with room measurements with a two-dimensional Euclidean distance error of 19.8cm. When tested in six different environments, we saw that the system can identify Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signals with over 80% accuracy and track a user's location to within less than 100cm.

In addition, low power consumption is very important for Internet-of-Things (IoT) receivers. We propose a 2.4-GHz zero-intermediate frequency (IF) receiver front-end architecture that reduces power consumption by 2 x compared with state-of-the-art and improves selectivity by >20-dB without compromising on other receiver metrics. To achieve this, the entire receive chain is optimized. The low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) is optimized to combine low noise with low power consumption. State-of-the-art sub-30-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes have almost equal strength complementary field-effect transistors (FETs) that result in altered design tradeoffs. A Windmill 25%-duty cycle frequency divider architecture is proposed, which uses only a single NOR-gate buffer per phase to minimize power consumption and phase noise. The proposed divider requires half the power consumption and has 2 dB or more reduced phase noise when benchmarked against state-of-the-art designs. An analog finite impulse response (FIR) filter is implemented to provide very high receiver selectivity with ultralow power consumption. The receiver front end is fabricated in a 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology and has an active area of 0.5 mm(2). It consumes 370 mu W from a 700-mV supply voltage. This low power consumption is combined with a 5.5-dB noise figure. The receiver front end has -7.5-dBm input-referred third-order-intercept point (IIP3) and 1-dB gain compression for a -22-dBm blocker, both at maximum gain of 61 dB. From three channels offset onward, the adjacent channel rejection (ACR) is >= 63 dB for Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE), BT5.0, and IEEE802.15.4.	[Thijssen, Bart J.; Klumperink, Eric A.

A wearable and smart actuator for haptic stimulation	MICRO AND NANO ENGINEERING			English	Article						Haptic stimulation; Flexible electronics; Wearable; Portable; Wireless; Android	AUGMENTED REALITY; PDMS SUBSTRATE; FILMS	Wearable tactile technology in the configuration of actuated thimbles is used to provide the sense of touch in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and teleoperation contexts. The design of these types of devices includes specific purposes: limiting the overall dimensions of the system to enhance the wearability and increasing the effectiveness and naturalness of the stimulation. This new generation of wearable touch systems can transmit tactile signals more naturally, whilst also being comfortably worn by the user, portable and integrated in daily life. In this direction, we propose a haptic device based on electro-cutaneous feedback to selectively stimulate each mechanoreceptor to discriminate specific tactile sensations. Two important features characterize and make our device innovative: wearability and ease of use. The first feature is enhanced by a flexible holder made of a combination of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Kapton layers, that allows the device to be wrapped around the fingertip to provide stimulation in the area with higher density of mechanoreceptors and make possible to place the system ground close to the stimulus application point. A more complex stimulation enhances increasingly accurate tactile sensations, so the guidelines of our research were focused on the enrichment of parameters variety that define each stimulation (frequency, waveform, duty cycle, current intensity, anodic/ cathodic configuration, and dynamic stimulation) by the development of a functional electronics board (4 h of autonomy per battery discharge cycle). The second feature uses the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to connect the electronic board of the device to a common smartphone, which allows user to manage the stimu-lation through a specific Android application allowing intelligent and integrated control of the haptic micro -system. Our haptic device is lightweight, does not affect normal hand movement, portable and easy to manage via your smartphone; this makes it available to a large scale of people.

J	Lin, HC; Chen, MJ; Huang, JT				Lin, Hsin-Chang; Chen, Ming-Jen; Huang, Jung-Tang			An IoT-based smart healthcare system using location-based mesh network and big data analytics	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND SMART ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Internet of things; big data; smart healthcare; elderly; location-based mesh network (LBMN)	PREVALENCE; DEMENTIA	Elderly people requiring care the entire day usually depend on the availability of their family members to give assistance. However, the family members might not provide appropriate help especially in an emergent situation. The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology with a variety of interconnected devices provides the solution. We propose an IoT-based smart healthcare system comprising wearable devices, which integrates a variety of contact sensors with location-based mesh networks (LBMN) such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections to continuously sense various parameters of aging people. The BLE-connected devices such as wearable sensors, fixed sensors, seat cushions, pedal mats, magnetic reed switches, and mobile devices are all involved in collecting, processing, and transmitting physiological data and their locations to the cloud. Through the utilization of convenient interfaces such as software applications on smartphones and web pages on computers, it provides real time monitoring of the elderly in terms of localization, activity pattern, and health status. Thus the system enables early detection of health risks to the elderly. We used Platform as a service (PaaS) to receive and store the health data generated from the interconnected devices and to perform analysis. The essential feature of this LBMN is to generate a complete 6W(Who, What,When,Where,Why and How)big data for policy, feed it to the PaaS analysis to easily and quickly obtain more accurate data, and then develop possible health strategy or preventive measures. The proposed healthcare system detected that, out of the 20 participants recruited, 2 persons (10%) were often restless. It was also able to detect abnormal daily activity patterns with more tag positioning and the historical data from the devices. More importantly, it can help to prevent potential physical and neuropsychiatric disorders based on the real-time monitoring information and analyzed historical data for the aging people.

Finding objects using UWB or BLE localization technology: A museum-like use case	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDOOR POSITIONING AND INDOOR NAVIGATION (IPIN)	International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	SEP 18-21, 2017	Sapporo, JAPAN	IEEE, Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, SECOM		UWB; BLE; Distance Measurement; localization; Finding objects; Estimote; Bespoon	NLOS IDENTIFICATION; POSITIONING SYSTEMS; MITIGATION; NETWORKS	Some location-aware use cases imply that a person desires to find an object relative to his position. This is the case of museum visits or any indoors/outdoors activity where the objects of interest are not geo-referenced or even can move with time. For these use cases, a user does not need an absolute localization, but a relative information consisting of the range to the object and the heading angle between that object and the user's moving direction. In this paper we study two different radio technologies for finding an object of interest: Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Range and orientation estimation performance is studied when using just the distance or the Received-Signal-Strength (RSS) provided by UWB and BLE systems, respectively. Both approaches are combined with Pedestrian Dead-reckoning (PDR) estimation in order to analyze the benefits that PDR information provides. For completeness we compare the cases where only one tag is fixed to the object to locate (the simpler and more flexible case) with the more ideal case where several geo-referenced objects of interest, each one with a tag, jointly cooperate to improve the relative location to one of the objects of interest (in both cases the user carries a mobile phone with BLE 4.0 or UWB radio). The UWB ranging radio, not common in most smartphones, but very accurate, is used as our reference to define the best achievable performance goal, in order to compare with BLE RSS-based performance. We demonstrate that the common BLE low ranging-accuracy technology combined with smartphone-based PDR estimation is capable, after some initial user's walking, of finding with decent range and heading accuracy the objects of interest in a museumlike set-up.

J	Fekr, AR; Janidarmian, M; Radecka, K; Zilic, Z				Fekr, Atena Roshan; Janidarmian, Majid; Radecka, Katarzyna; Zilic, Zeljko			A Medical Cloud-Based Platform for Respiration Rate Measurement and Hierarchical Classification of Breath Disorders	SENSORS			English	Article						respiration rate; breath analysis; accelerometer sensor; Support Vector Machine; breath disorder	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; ACCELEROMETER	The measurement of human respiratory signals is crucial in cyberbiological systems. A disordered breathing pattern can be the first symptom of different physiological, mechanical, or psychological dysfunctions. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of the respiration patterns, as well as respiration rate is a critical need in medical applications. There are several methods for respiration rate measurement. However, despite their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based platform for both monitoring the respiration rate and breath pattern classification, remotely. The proposed system is designed particularly for patients with breathing problems (e. g., respiratory complications after surgery) or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud-computing model. We also suggest a procedure to improve the accuracy of respiration rate for patients at rest positions. The overall error in the respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.53% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. Five types of respiration disorders, Bradapnea, Tachypnea, Cheyn-stokes, Kaussmal, and Biot's breathing are classified based on hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) with seven different features. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed classification while it is individualized to every subject (case 1) as well as considering all subjects (case 2). Since the selection of kernel function is a key factor to decide SVM's performance, in this paper three different kernel functions are evaluated. The experiments are conducted with 11 subjects and the average accuracy of 94.52% for case 1 and the accuracy of 81.29% for case 2 are achieved based on Radial Basis Function (RBF). Finally, a performance evaluation has been done for normal and impaired subjects considering sensitivity, specificity and G-mean parameters of different kernel functions.

Almost the whole world, at some point of time, was placed in lock-down in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, with resulting psychological and economic sequela. As countries start to ease lock-down measures and reopen industries, ensuring a healthy workplace for employees has become imperative. Thus, this paper presents a mobile app-based intelligent portable healthcare (pHealth) tool, called i WorkSafe, to assist industries in detecting possible suspects for COVID-19 infection among their employees who may need primary care. Developed mainly for low-end Android devices, the i WorkSafe app hosts a fuzzy neural network model that integrates data of employees' health status from the industry's database, proximity and contact tracing data from the mobile devices, and user-reported COVID-19 self-test data. Using the built-in Bluetooth low energy sensing technology and K Nearest Neighbor and K-means techniques, the app is capable of tracking users' proximity and trace contact with other employees. Additionally, it uses a logistic regression model to calculate the COVID-19 self-test score and a Bayesian Decision Tree model for checking real-time health condition from an intelligent e-health platform for further clinical attention of the employees. Rolled out in an apparel factory on 12 employees as a test case, the pHealth tool generates an alert to maintain social distancing among employees inside the industry. In addition, the app helps employees to estimate risk with possible COVID-19 infection based on the collected data and found that the score is effective in estimating personal health condition of the app user.

Wireless Coexistence of Cellular LBT Systems and BLE 5	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Wireless fidelity; Wireless communication; Bluetooth; Throughput; Interference; Wireless sensor networks; 5G mobile communication; 5G NR-U; BLE 5; coexistence; empirical evaluation; LBT; wireless medical devices	WI-FI; LTE; THROUGHPUT	The 2.4 GHz spectrum is home to several Radio Access Technologies (RATs), including ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Wi-Fi. Accordingly, the technologies' spectrum-sharing qualities have been extensively studied in literature. License-Assisted Access (LAA) Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) has been identified in technical reports as the foundation for the channel access mechanism for 5G New Radio-Unlicensed (NR-U) operating in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. The introduction of NR-U into this band raises new concerns regarding coexistence of the newcomer with traditional incumbents. This article reports an investigation of BLE 5 and cellular LBT coexisting systems by means of empirical evaluation. The importance of this study stems from that the studied LBT mechanism is indicative of how 5G NR-U would perform in the 2.4 GHz band. Tests were performed in conformity with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C63.27 standard for evaluation of wireless coexistence, and results were reported in terms of throughput and interframe delays. In accordance with the standard and under different BLE physical layers (PHYs) and LBT priority classes, three setups were investigated. These pertain to the three tiers of evaluation, which correspond to the criticality of the device under test. Results demonstrated how BLE throughput dropped as the intended-to-unintended signal ratio decreased, and LBT classes exhibited a diminishing effect as the class priority descended. Long Range BLE PHY was found to sustain longer gap times (i.e., delay) than the other two PHYs; however, it showed less susceptibility to interference. Results also demonstrated that low data rate BLE PHYs hindered the LBT throughput performance since they correspond to longer airtime durations.

Infectious disease experts working on the COVID-19 pandemic call this high-risk situation being Too Close for Too Long (TCTL). Consequently, the problem of detecting the TCTL situation in order to maintain appropriate social distance has attracted considerable attention recently. One of the most prominent TCTL detection ideas being explored involves utilizing the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to determine whether the owners of two smartphones are observing the acceptable social distance of 6 ft. However, using RSSI measurements to detect the TCTL situation is extremely challenging due to the significant signal variance caused by multipath fading in indoor radio channel, carrying the smartphone in different pockets or positions, and differences in smartphone manufacturer and type of the device. In this study we utilize the Mitre Range Angle Structured (MRAS) Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT) dataset to extensively evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in comparison to classical estimation theory techniques to solve the TCTL problem. We provide a comparative performance evaluation of proximity classification accuracy and the corresponding confidence levels using classical estimation theory and a variety of ML algorithms. As the classical estimation method utilizes RSSI characteristics models, it is faster to compute, is more explainable, and drives an analytical solution for the precision bounds proximity estimation. The ML algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) utilized thirteen spatial, time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical features extracted from the BLE RSSI data to generate the same results as classical estimation algorithms. We show that ML algorithms can achieve 3.60%similar to 19.98% better precision, getting closer to achievable bounds for estimation.

Such a model calculates the energy at each node by estimating the energy of the main functions developed at sensing and transmitting data when running the routing protocol. These functions are related to wireless communications and measured and compared to the most relevant impact on an energy standpoint and performance metrics. The energy model is validated using a Texas Instruments CC2530 system-on-chip (SoC), as a proof-of-concept. The proposed energy model is then used to calculate the energy consumption of a Multi-Parent Hierarchical (MPH) routing protocol and five widely known network sensors routing protocols: Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), ZigBee Tree Routing (ZTR), Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), and Power Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS). Experimental test-bed simulations were performed on a random layout topology with two collector nodes. Each node was running under different wireless technologies: Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy, and LoRa by WiFi. The objective of this work is to analyze the performance of the proposed energy model in routing protocols of diverse nature: reactive, proactive, hybrid and energy-aware. Experimental results show that the MPH routing protocol consumes 16%, 13%, and 5% less energy when compared to AODV, DSR, and ZTR, respectively; and it presents only 2% and 3% of greater energy consumption with respect to the energy-aware PEGASIS and LEACH protocols, respectively. The proposed model achieves a 97% accuracy compared to the actual performance of a network. Tests are performed to analyze the consumption of the main tasks of a node in a network.

The aquaponics is a system that combines aquaculture and hydroponic cultivation equipment where the excrement of fishes is broken down by bacteria into nutrients utilized by plants. In the system, optimization of activity of the bacteria is an important problem to maximize the harvest amount from both aquaculture and cultivation, but an automatic control system that can keep the activity in an optimal state has not been achieved. Therefore, in this study, a new sensor network system that remotely monitors various environmental information of water (e.g., water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen) affecting the growing conditions of aquaculture and cultivation, and that quantitatively estimates the degree of plant/fish growth is proposed. In the proposed system, a depth camera module is utilized to grasp a detailed shape of each plant, and an area of each part (i.e., leaf, stem) of the plant is estimated by analyzing both RGB and depth images to quantify a growth condition of the plant automatically. Also, measurement results of the environmental information are automatically collected from each sensor through a low-power short-range wireless communication (i.e., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)). Furthermore, the obtained information is analyzed to specify the correlation between the growth condition and the environmental information. Based on the correlation, the proposed system controls the water quality so that the activity of the bacteria becomes optimal for each kind of plant/fish. Through the performance evaluation, it is clarified that the use of BLE is suitable for constructing a sensor network for collecting the environmental information, and the growth condition of the plant can be estimated at a high accuracy.

Although the global positioning system is widely used for outdoor positioning, it cannot provide the same accuracy for the indoor. As a result, many alternative indoor positioning technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and geomagnetic field localization have been investigated during the last few years. Today smartphones possess a rich variety of embedded sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer that can facilitate estimating the current location of the user. Traditional geomagnetic field-based fingerprint localization, although it shows promising results, it is limited by the fact that various smartphones have embedded magnetic sensors from different manufacturers and the magnetic field strength that is measured from these smartphones vary significantly. Consequently, the localization performance from various smartphones is different even when the same localization approach is used. So devising an approach that can provide similar performance with various smartphones is a big challenge. Contrary to previous works that build the fingerprint database from the geomagnetic field data of a single smartphone, this study proposes using the geomagnetic field data collected from multiple smartphones to make the geomagnetic field pattern (MP) database. Many experiments are carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed approach with various smartphones. Additionally, a lightweight threshold technique is proposed that can detect user motion using the acceleration data. Results demonstrate that the localization performance for four different smartphones is almost identical when tested with the database made using the magnetic field data from multiple smartphones than that of which considers the magnetic field data from only one smartphone. Moreover, the performance comparison with previous research indicates that the overall performance of smartphones is improved.

J	Bae, Y				Bae, Youngchul			Robust Localization for Robot and IoT Using RSSI	ENERGIES			English	Article						node localization; RSSI; IoT; robot; received signal strength intensity	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	Node-localization technology has been supported in the wireless sensor network (WSN) environment. Node localization is based on a few access-point (AP) nodes that comprises positioning information because they are fixed, and a beacon node that comprises unknown positioning information because it is moving. To determine the position of the unknown node, it must use two or three APs that comprise certain positioning information. There are a number of representative range-based methods, including time of arrival (TOA), weighted centroid locating algorithm, received signal strength intensity (RSSI), and time difference of arrival (TDOA) signal, that are received by the receiver. The RSSI method has its advantages. A simple device structure means that the RSSI method is easy to use. Because the structures of previous wireless local area network (LAN) technologies make them compatible with RSSI information, the RSSI method is widely used in the related area of position tracking. In addition, this algorithm has a hardware system that cannot be increased, has the advantage of the miniaturization of the node, and can wear through obstacles. This paper proposes the application of a robust ranging method that can be applied in robots and Internet of Things (IoT) using RSSI, especially in the tracing location of each nursing home patient, where the RSSI method with trilateral technique is used. This paper shows the results of the measured point from the application of the trilateral technique, and it also represents the results of the error distance between the ideal point and the measured point using computer simulation. Finally, this paper presents an estimation of localization using a real experimental device with a BLE (Bluetooth low-energy) transmitter and receiver, and beacon gateway, by applying an RSSI algorithm with the trilateral technique.

NFC offers great and varied promise in providing secure and implicit paired communication capability in smartphones. As a short-range wireless communication technology, the level of "secure" is contributed by the short-range nature. Compared with other competitive technologies, NFC achieves physical-level security but sacrifices convenience. For example, NFC cannot achieve device-free or hands-free payment transactions like the service provided by PayPal called PayPal beacon which utilizes Bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) technology. In this paper, we propose a low-cost wearable device that can achieve better physical-level security than NFC provides. This system is compatible with existing NFC-based POS systems and can help users realize a convenient hands-free payment transaction. Specifically, a custom NFC wristband was designed to channel its magnetic field through the human arm. By confining the magnetic field in NFC to the area around the body, we could minimize energy radiation, reduce the possibility of communication sniffing and hijackings, and improve security. To evaluate this approach, we conducted various experiments via different configurations. The results showed that the communication range for the human body channel was greater than that of the air and water channels. In addition, through this study we demonstrated that the human body is a naturally secure channel, and hacking and nearby interference are minimized during such communication. Our system also defines a new way of communication, for example, people can share confidential information with a simple handshake without pulling out and touching, or tapping smartphones.

Relations between animals are important because of animals welfare and can influence on animal health and productivity. In the early stage of the research, relations between animals were determined on the base of the distance between animals and described as like/not like" (they like each other or not). It's difficult to precisely determine when animals like each other. Not only distance is the criterium but also time and direct behavior. The experiment was carried out in the cowshed with 70 dairy cows. BLE Beacons (Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons) were attached to the cows and they regularly transmitted data about the cows' localisation in the cowshed to the smartphones which were distributed in the cowshed. From smartphones with Android system data were sent to the relational database. Because of the large amount of data, in the database data were processed, i.e. aggregated. Some of the data were transformed to the geometric form and then, thanks to the specially developed application, these geometric data were mapped to relations and written in the graph database. Graph databases are very useful tool to analyse and show relations between animals. The Neo4j technology was used to prepare the graph database. Other ICT technologies used in this work were: SQL Server 2014, Visual Studio 2015 and Entity Framework 6. Relational databases are still very usefull to analyse data and the graph databases are especially useful to visualize the spatial relations between objects. New technologies allows to widen our perceptions and create new possibilities of getting knowledge. There are a lot of tools to connect these technoogies, but it requires multidisciplinary approach.

J	Jiang, JR; Subakti, H				Jiang, Jehn-Ruey; Subakti, Hanas			An Indoor Location-Based Augmented Reality Framework	SENSORS			English	Article						augmented reality; indoor localization; context-awareness		This paper proposes an indoor location-based augmented reality framework (ILARF) for the development of indoor augmented-reality (AR) systems. ILARF integrates an indoor localization unit (ILU), a secure context-aware message exchange unit (SCAMEU), and an AR visualization and interaction unit (ARVIU). The ILU runs on a mobile device such as a smartphone and utilizes visible markers (e.g., images and text), invisible markers (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and NFC signals), and device sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers) to determine the device location and direction. The SCAMEU utilizes a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) server to exchange ambient sensor data (e.g., temperature, light, and humidity readings) and user data (e.g., user location and user speed) for context-awareness. The unit also employs a web server to manage user profiles and settings. The ARVIU uses AR creation tools to handle user interaction and display context-aware information in appropriate areas of the device's screen. One prototype AR app for use in gyms, Gym Augmented Reality (GAR), was developed based on ILARF. Users can register their profiles and configure settings when using GAR to visit a gym. Then, GAR can help users locate appropriate gym equipment based on their workout programs or favorite exercise specified in their profiles. GAR provides instructions on how to properly use the gym equipment and also makes it possible for gym users to socialize with each other, which may motivate them to go to the gym regularly. GAR is compared with other related AR systems. The comparison shows that GAR is superior to others by virtue of its use of ILARF; specifically, it provides more information, such as user location and direction, and has more desirable properties, such as secure communication and a 3D graphical user interface.

A low-power local processor is proposed, which can perform signal processing to convert raw magnetic sensor signals to user-defined commands, on the sTDS wearable headset, rather than sending all raw data out to a PC or smartphone. The proposed sTDS significantly reduces the transmitter power consumption and subsequently increases the battery life. Assuming the sTDS user issues one command every 20 ms, the proposed local processor reduces the data volume that needs to be wirelessly transmitted by a factor of 64, from 9.6 to 0.15 kb/s. The proposed processor consists of three main blocks: serial peripheral interface bus for receiving raw data from magnetic sensors, external magnetic interference attenuation to attenuate external magnetic field from the raw magnetic signal, and a machine learning classifier for command detection. A proof-of-concept prototype sTDS has been implemented with a low-power IGLOO-nano field programmable gate array (FPGA), bluetooth low energy, battery and magnetic sensors on a headset, and tested. At clock frequency of 20 MHz, the processor takes 6.6 mu s and consumes 27 nJ for detecting a command with a detection accuracy of 96.9%. To further reduce power consumption, an application-specified integrated circuit processor for the sTDS is implemented at the postlayout level in 65-nm CMOS technology with 1-V power supply, and it consumes 0.43 mW, which is 10x lower than FPGA power consumption and occupies an area of only 0.016 mm(2)	[Jafari, Ali; Buswell, Nathanael; Mohsenin, Tinoosh] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Comp Sci & Elect Engn Dept, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Ghovanloo, Maysam] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA	University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology	Jafari, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Comp Sci & Elect Engn Dept, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.	a137@umbc.edu; nat6@umbc.edu; mgh@gatech.edu; tinoosh@umbc.edu	Ghovanloo, Maysam/O-3468-2019	Ghovanloo, Maysam/0000-0001-9502-3704	National Science Foundation [00010145]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [0953107] Funding Source: National Science Foundation	National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))	This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant 00010145.

The aim is to complement currently dominant Bluetooth Low Energy Received Signal Strength Indicator (BLE RSSI) approaches. These often struggle with the complexity of Radio Frequency (RF) signal attenuation, which is strongly influenced by specific surrounding characteristics. This in turn renders the relationship between signal strength and the distance between transmitter and receiver highly non-deterministic. We analyze spatio-temporal variations in what we call "ambient sound fingerprints". We leverage the fact that ambient sound received by a mobile device is a superposition of sounds from sources at many different locations in the environment. Such a superposition is determined by the relative position of those sources with respect to the receiver. We present a method for using the above general idea to classify proximity between pairs of users based on Kullback-Leibler distance between sound intensity histograms. The method is based on intensity analysis only, and does not require the collection of any privacy sensitive signals. Further, we show how this information can be fused with BLE RSSI features using adaptive weighted voting. We also take into account that sound is not available in all windows. Our approach is evaluated in elaborate experiments in real-world settings. The results show that both Bluetooth and sound can be used to differentiate users within and out of critical distance (1.5 m) with high accuracies of 77% and 80% respectively. Their fusion, however, improves this to 86%, making evident the merit of augmenting BLE RSSI with sound. We conclude by discussing strengths and limitations of our approach and highlighting directions for future work.

As a result of that, average person's lifetime duration has been increased. That triggers the problem of independent living of senior citizens. One of the main concerns of the world today is how to enable senior citizens to live independently. As a response to that, systems like eWALL are being developed. eWALL for Active Long Living is a FP7 funded project and it aims to develop system which will enable elderly people to live independently. These systems consist of a large number of sensors which make wireless sensor network. In this paper, different wireless technologies that can be used for communication in systems that are designed to support independent living of elderly people, have been described. The most important focus is at wireless personal area network technologies, like ZigBee, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless local area network technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi). There are many obstacles in designing wireless sensor network and most of them concern energy efficiency and interoperability of different technologies that are being used for communication. The main challenge in the current technology world is tremendous increase of use of various wireless devices and technologies, which can cause relatively high interference, so that the wireless devices can stop working. Using cognitive radio in solving the interoperability problem of different wireless technologies in wireless sensor networks has become interesting research topic. In this paper, research on interoperability of different wireless technologies is presented. Using Spectrum Engineering Advanced Monte Carlo Analysis Tool wireless sensors network in home environment was modelled. Interference based on devices layout and activity was investigated. Also, possible improvements that can be made with cognitive radio are investigated and obtained results are given in this paper.

It studies the received signal strength across different usage scenarios and obstructions such as body shadow, wall and ceiling through measurement campaigns carried out in a 2-storey house. It is observed that RSSIs show little variation from the mean value at any position in a given room of the house. In the living room, the average RSSI for patch, printed and external monopole is close to -61,-73 and -61 dBm respectively. The study describes the effect of usual obstructions such as wall and ceiling to off-body links and shows that the range of RSSI for any antenna (30 dBm at P=0.5 for Patch Antenna) is bounded at one end by the CDF of wall plus body shadow and at the other end by CDF of Line of Sight (LOS). The effect of body shadowing is studied in greater detail. It is observed that the microstrip patch antenna in LOS, under a ceiling and behind a wall, drops by approximately 15dB, 5dB and 10dB at P=0.4 when it goes into body shadow. The study also suggests that the Access Point (AP) on the ceiling provides better off-body links as compared to it in the adjacent room. The study compares the overall performance of the three antennas across all possible usage scenarios, obstructions & polarizations and concludes that the external monopole and patch antenna performs better than printed monopole by approximately 10-13 dBm. Finally, the study shows the variation of Packet Error Rate (PER) with RSSI and determines threshold values of RSSI for acceptable PERs, for reliable and robust applications.

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth positioning systems using fingerprinting have gained popularity, due to the wide availability of existing infrastructure. Unfortunately, the implementation of fingerprinting-based methods requires time-consuming radio surveys to prepare databases (RSSI maps) that serve as a reference for the radio signal. These surveys must be conducted for each individual building. Here, we investigate the possibility of using simulated RSSI maps with fingerprinting-based indoor localization systems. We discuss the suitability of the two popular radio wave propagation models for the preparation of RSSI reference data: ray tracing and multiwall. Based on an analysis of several representative indoor scenarios, we evaluated the performance of RSSI distribution maps obtained from simulations versus maps obtained from measurement campaigns. An experimental positioning system developed by the authors was used in the study. Based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and mobile devices (smartphones), the system uses fingerprinting followed by a particle filter algorithm to estimate the user's current position from RSSI measurements and a reference spatial RSSI distribution database for each Bluetooth beacon in the building. The novelty of our contribution is that we evaluate the performance of the positioning system with RSSI maps prepared both from measurements and using the two most representative indoor propagation methods, in three different environments in terms of structure and size. We compared not only the three RSSI maps, but also how they influence the performance of the fingerprint-based positioning algorithm. Our original findings have important implications for the development of indoor localization systems and may reduce deployment times by replacing reference measurements with computer simulations. Replacing the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of building reference maps with computer modeling may significantly increase their usefulness and ease of adaptation in real indoor environments.

J	Ma, W; Zhang, S; Huang, JC				Ma, Wei; Zhang, Shuai; Huang, Jincai			Mobile augmented reality based indoor map for improving geo-visualization	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Mobile augmented reality; BLE and PDR fusion; Indoor map; Indoor localization; Geo-visualization	LOCATION	Unlike traditional visualization methods, augmented reality (AR) inserts virtual objects and information directly into digital representations of the real world, which makes these objects and data more easily understood and interactive. The integration of AR and GIS is a promising way to display spatial information in context. However, most existing AR-GIS applications only provide local spatial information in a fixed location, which is exposed to a set of problems, limited legibility, information clutter and the incomplete spatial relationships. In addition, the indoor space structure is complex and GPS is unavailable, so that indoor AR systems are further impeded by the limited capacity of these systems to detect and display location and semantic information. To address this problem, the localization technique for tracking the camera positions was fused by Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). The multi-sensor fusion-based algorithm employs a particle filter. Based on the direction and position of the phone, the spatial information is automatically registered onto a live camera view. The proposed algorithm extracts and matches a bounding box of the indoor map to a real world scene. Finally, the indoor map and semantic information were rendered into the real world, based on the real-time computed spatial relationship between the indoor map and live camera view. Experimental results demonstrate that the average positioning error of our approach is 1.47 m, and 80% of proposed method error is within approximately 1.8 m. The positioning result can effectively support that AR and indoor map fusion technique links rich indoor spatial information to real world scenes. The method is not only suitable for traditional tasks related to indoor navigation, but it is also promising method for crowdsourcing data collection and indoor map reconstruction.

The growth of technology can be incorporated with the rising events triggering a need for a better lifestyle. Recent technological advancement which has influenced a change in lifestyle, is the field of IoT (Internet of Things). The applications of IoT are vast and innumerable. One such application can be implied for the Automobile industry to improve the quality and safety of the vehicles. With the increase in number of accidents and the deteriorating performance of the cars, there is a need for a pragmatic real time monitoring system and a self-learning algorithm for smart predictions. We use the Raspberry Pi as our GPU running Machine Learning algorithm [K-Nearest neighbor (KNN) and [Valve Bayesian algorithm] predicting the vehicle condition and life prediction of Engine, Coolant, etc. We are planning to implement such a system which will be user friendly and user interactive. We propose two methods for data handling, 1] Develop Bluetooth low energy technology as the communication module for data transmission to the cloud database. 2] Alternatively, 4G Dongle can be used for transmitting data directly to the cloud and the mobile application from the Raspberry pi. The cutting edge feature of BLE is its low power consumption and can also be integrated to many sensors at any point in time (scalable technology). Our prototype is using the BLE Communication for OBD-II (On board Diagnostics) - Raspberry pi communication and Wi-Fi for cloud interfacing. We have integrated OBD-II in a FORD Manufactured car to extract the following data: Speed, air pressure, temperature, CO2 emission, GPS Coordinates, Fuel Level indicator sensor. The Raspberry Pi will run the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm and output the results and live prediction of vehicle condition to the mobile application.

The sensor is worn on the wrist, and the raw data are transmitted to the computer via Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to verify the captured data, a recognition system with machine learning classification process is built. The gestures to be recognized can be divided into two categories, with the first being single gestures, which includes ten basic movements, and the second the continuous combinational gestures, which is composed of the previous ten basic movements through different combinations. In order to achieve higher recognition accuracy, we used machine learning process in the system and two analyses, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), to extract well distinguished features. The main advantage of PCA and LDA is reducing dimensions of data while preserving as much of the class discriminatory information as possible. In addition, later processing time can be decreased due to reduced dimensions of data. The experiment is then proceeded with support vector machine (SVM) and dynamic time warping (DTW). With SVM technique, we can recognize movement with higher accuracy and less computation time. High dimension data are also supported. Even non-linear relations can be modeled with more precise classification due to SVM kernels. Dynamic time warping increases recognition accuracy by categorizing movements through the measurement of the resemblance among several temporal sequences which may alter in speed. In the experiment, we can get the accuracy of recognition at 100% for 10 classes with 40 subjects in single gesture under the case of user-dependent. And in continuous combinational gesture for the user-independent case, we can get the accuracy of recognition at 86.99% in fixed combinational gesture, and 60% in arbitrary combinational gesture.

Novel seamless navigation system design was implemented and tested to achieve this aim. The design consists of general navigation system framework blocks and of the necessary interface agreements between the blocks. This approach enables plug-and-play style design of modules. The implementation used four preselected key technologies. Microstrain 3DM-GX4-45 foot-mounted inertial measurement unit sensor data was fused together with the u-blox GNSS receiver positions outdoors. Context sensitive inference engine enabled the fusion of position updates indoors from the Decawave TREK1000 Ultra WideBand ranging kit and from the 6 Kontakt.io/Raspberry Pi anchor-based Bluetooth low energy fingeprinting system. Novel dual-mode filter design uses a particle filter and the pentagon buffer enhanced Kalman filter in the position solution derivation. Depending on the map and the walls in the environment and on the quality of position updates, the implemented control logic employs the most fit filter for the current context. Computational power is now focussed, when particle filter is needed. The novel pentagon buffer enhanced Kalman filter is 10 times faster, allowing power saving when situation is not too critical. Moreover, the buffer provides position updates by interacting with the map and helps to correct the position solution. The navigation system is seamless according to the tests conducted around and within the Nottingham Geospatial building. No user input is needed for smooth transition from outdoors to indoors and vice versa. The system achieves an accuracy of 2.35 m outdoors and 1.4 m indoors (95% of error). Inertial system availability was continuous, while GNSS was available outdoors and BLE and UWB indoors.

Printed electronics (PE) is a good platform for such sensors because it enables the realization of flexible devices through simple and rapid methods at a relatively low cost. However, previously reported printed temperature sensors suffer frompoor sensitivity and/or environmental instability. In this article, we report a custom tungsten (W)-doped vanadium dioxide (VO2) ink-based screen-printed temperature sensor having the highest temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of 2.78%.center dot C-1 with a resolution of 0.1 degrees C between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. To protect it from environmental effects, a fluoropolymer-basedpassivation layer is added for accurate temperature readings even in 90% relative humidity. The sensor is printed on a flexible substrate and shows minimal deterioration in performance over 1000 bending cycles. For wearability and remote monitoring, the sensor is integrated with a custom Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless readout in the form of wristband. The BLE readout comprises an ultrathin and flexible patch antenna optimized for both BLE bandwidth (BW) and human wearability. It demonstrates a minimal specific absorption rate (SAR) value of only 0.068 W/kg, making it safe to wear. Despite the antenna's thin structure (0.004 lambda),it has a gain of 1.65 dBi, enabling an excellent communication range. The proposed wristband is tested on ten volunteers and under daily activities, which shows promising results with a maximum error of 0.16 degrees C with reference to those of a commercial thermometer.

We analyzed the fundamental algorithms in communications systems on IoT devices to enable a microarchitecture design that supports many IoT standards and custom nonstandard communications. Based on this analysis, we propose a custom SIMD execution model coupled with a scalar unit. We introduce several architectural optimizations to this design: streaming registers, variable bit width data-path, dedicated ALUs for critical kernels, and an optimized flexible reduction network. We employ voltage scaling and clock gating to further reduce the power, while more than a 100% time margin has been reserved for reliable operation in the near-threshold region. Together our architectural enhancements lead to a 71x power reduction compared to a classic general purpose SDR SIMD architecture. Our IoT SDR datapath has sub-mW power consumption based on SPICE simulation, and is placed and routed to fit within an area of 0.074mm(2) in a 28nm process. We implemented several essential elementary signal processing kernels and combined them to demonstrate two end-to-end upper bound systems, 802.15.4-OQPSK and Bluetooth Low Energy. Our full SDR baseband system consists of a configurable SIMD with a control plane MCU and memory. For comparison, the best commercial wireless transceiver consumes 23.8mW for the entire wireless system (digital/RF/analog). We show that our digital system power is below 2mW, in other words only 8% of the total system power. The wireless system is dominated by RF/analog power comsumption, thus the price of flexibility that SDR affords is small. We believe this work is unique in demonstrating the value of baseband SDR in the low power IoT domain.

Among these, electronic tags help identify individual growing-finishing pigs. Nevertheless, the tags are insufficient to achieve accurate and reliable monitoring in pigsties. Instead, advanced processing data for individual behaviors, such as visit times in the feeding and resting areas and the number of movements between these areas, are required. Numerically measuring the movements of individual pigs in the pigsty is a precondition for obtaining these data. This paper proposes a monitoring scheme of a large herd of pigs for individual identification and counting. As a technical solution, a monitoring system is developed using Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) tags and wireless broadband leaky coaxial cable (WBLCX) antennas. The monitoring system collects access data transmitted from the BLE tags attached to individual pigs. Then the monitoring scheme estimates the location and movement of each pig by computing the collected data. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the detection characteristics between the BLE tags and the WBLCX antennas and to show their performances. In addition, the effectiveness for the proposed area-determination algorithm and the monitoring system was verified by field experiments on a pig farm in Japan. Our experimental results are summarized as follows. First, data comparisons between the area-determination algorithm and visual inspections confirmed the validity of the proposed monitoring scheme. Secondly, by the monitoring scheme, the area movements and the dwell times of pigs in a pigsty could be investigated. From the experimental results, the use of the proposed monitoring is expected to be able to observe the locations and movements for large herds of pigs in the pigsty. This paper proposes a monitoring scheme based on identifying and counting of individual pigs, explains the details of the monitoring scheme on the basis of hardware configurations, and verifies its effectiveness and feasibility via experiments.

Building Decentralized Fog Computing-Based Smart Parking Systems: From Deterministic Propagation Modeling to Practical Deployment	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Smart parking; fog computing; ZigBee; BLE; IoT; wireless channel; 3D-Ray Launching; IPFS	CITIES; DESIGN	The traditional process of finding a vacant parking slot is often inefficient: it increases driving time, traffic congestion, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. To address such problems, smart parking systems have been proposed to help drivers to find available parking slots faster using latest sensing and communications technologies. However, the deployment of the communications infrastructure of a smart parking is not straightforward due to multiple factors that may affect wireless propagation. Moreover, a smart parking system needs to provide not only accurate information on available spots, but also fast responses while guaranteeing the system availability even in the case of lacking connectivity. This article describes the development of a decentralized low-latency smart parking system: from its conception, design and theoretical simulation, to its empirical validation. Thus, this work first characterizes a real-world scenario and proposes a fog computing and Internet of Things (IoT) based communications architecture to provide smart parking services. Next, a thorough analysis on the wireless channel properties is carried out by means of an in-house developed deterministic 3D-Ray Launching (3D-RL) tool. The obtained results are validated through a real-world measurement campaign and then the communications architecture is implemented by using ZigBee sensor nodes. The implemented architecture also makes use of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons, an Android app, a decentralized database and fog computing gateways, whose performance is evaluated in terms of response latency and processing rate. Results show that the proposed system is able to deliver information to the drivers fast, with no need for relying on remote servers. As a consequence, the presented development methodology and communications evaluation tool can be useful for future smart parking developers, which can determine the optimal locations of the wireless transceivers during the simulation stage and then deploy a system that can provide fast responses and decentralized services.

J	Alrowaily, MA				Alrowaily, Majed Abdullah			Utilizing beacon technology for the development of a smart attendance system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Internet of things; Beacon; Technology; Attendance system; Heuristic evaluation		Tracking students' attendance is part of academic cycles, however, academic staff members become overwhelmed by applying traditional methods for recording this. The dominant method of recording attendance is traditional methods such as calling students' names and passing attendance sheets. These methods raise some concerns such as being time-consuming, spreading Coronavirus by sharing the attendance sheet, and other issues. The introduced and implemented solutions in the literature are rather expensive, time-consuming, lack accuracy, or require a long process to record the attendance. In this project, we aim to investigate the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons at the main campus of Tabuk University to build a smart attendance system called the UTSA system. This system will help to overcome the raised concerns of applying the traditional methods for recording student attendance. Three interactive HTML prototypes were developed and examined using a heuristic evaluation methodology. The third proposed prototype, the instructor web-based system, was the most pleasing prototype by most evaluators compared to the two prototypes of the mobile app. All of the evaluators agreed that the current attendance system at Tabuk University is time-consuming and vulnerable to human errors during the transference of attendees from the attendance sheets to the online attendance system. The proposed system of this work provides an accurate and affordable method for signing in the students' attendance as it is going to be done using two steps for recording the attendance: Students mobile attendance broadcasting and academic staff verification process using the proposed app. Moreover, no additional equipment needs to be installed to apply the proposed solution as it used the students and the academic staff members mobile phones.

A physical activity can either create or prevent health issues during a given stage of pregnancy depending on its intensity. Thus, it becomes very important to provide continuous feedback by recognizing a physical activity and its intensity. However, such continuous monitoring is very challenging during the whole period of maternity. In addition, maintaining a record of each physical activity, and the time for which it was performed, is also a non-trivial task. We aim at such problems by first recognizing a physical activity via the data of wearable sensors that are put on various parts of body. We avoid the use of smartphones for such task due to the inconvenience caused by wearing it for activities such as "eating". In our proposed framework, a module worn on body consists of three sensors: a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and temperature sensor. The time-series data from these sensors are sent to a Raspberry-PI via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Various statistical measures (features) of this data are then calculated and represented in features vectors. These feature vectors are then used to train a supervised machine learning algorithm called classifier for the recognition of physical activity from the sensors data. Based on such recognition, the proposed framework sends a message to the care-taker in case of unfavorable situation. We evaluated a number of well-known classifiers on various features developed from overlapped and non-overlapped window size of time-series data. Our novel dataset consists of 10 physical activities performed by 61 subjects at various stages of maternity. On the current dataset, we achieve the highest recognition rate of 89% which is encouraging for a monitoring and feedback system.

However, these localization methods have practical limits and challenges due to unstable signal strength, the cost of offline workload, computational complexity, terminal device heterogeneity, and accumulated sensor error. We propose a smartphone-based indoor localization system using weighted Spearman's foot-rule (WSF)-based probabilistic fingerprinting for reliable smartphone localization service. This localization system adopts a real-time fingerprinting position error estimation approach realizing an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) to integrate the proposed fingerprinting localization with inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based localization. This proposed WSF-based smartphone localization uses a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based signal prediction module to deal with fingerprinting localization's offline workload. Furthermore, the smartphone localization system's expected high computational complexity is controlled by employing a data-clustering module. The proposed WSF also employs a rank vector that helps mitigate the effect of terminal device heterogeneity. The proposed localization system is experimentally evaluated at two different representative indoor environments. Experimental results obtained by real field deployment show that the mean error is 2.06 m in an elongated hallway corridor and 3.47 m in the crowded and well-furnished wide area.

Nonintrusive Spatiotemporal Smart Debris Tracking in Turbulent Flows with Application to Debris-Laden Tsunami Inundation	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Smart debris; Orientation tracking; Position tracking; Debris transport; Off-the-shelf instrumentation; Laboratory instrumentation	TRANSPONDER PIT TAGS; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; IMPACT; RIVER; DYNAMICS; PEBBLES; SYSTEMS; BEACH	Flood disasters such as dam breaks and surges from extreme hurricanes or tsunamis entrain and transport substantial amounts of submerged or floating debris. Understanding of motion and spatiotemporal distribution of debris entrained by a flood is thus of great importance to hydraulic, coastal, and structural engineers; the displacement of debris to a location where it may eventually impact critical infrastructure requires scientific attention at the laboratory scale first. In this context, the design and application of a novel smart debris system utilizing off-the-shelf components is presented and discussed. The system tracks the spatial location and orientation of a multitude of debris specimens and it proposes an accurate tool to assess their individual trajectory, velocity, and momentum in a laboratory environment. Contrary to the traditional camera-based approach of video tracking, which often fails once objects are submerged, the proposed smart debris system delivers six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) data in a reliable, timely manner. Miniaturized inertial measurement units (IMU), commonly called motion sensors, which are used for attitude heading reference systems are deployed to output time series of spatial orientation along with filtered 3D acceleration readings. A Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) tracking system is applied along with the motion sensor to track the 3D debris positions. A detailed investigation in controlled laboratory conditions reveals the detailed individual performance of the tested spatial orientations and positions. As an application, debris transport tests were conducted in a newly built tsunami wave basin at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. For this test series, a typical harbor layout with a vertical quay wall adjacent to a horizontal container-stacking platform was constructed. The advection by a broken tsunamilike bore of multiple down-scaled shipping containers in basic arrangements was then tracked from their initial position. The performance of the innovative smart debris system is qualitatively tested in order to provide guidance for their future application in hydraulic and coastal engineering as well as to provide a solid basis for its application in field studies.

The existing studies have proposed an agricultural remote monitoring systems using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In the existing system, the environmental information is collected from a large number of sensor nodes installed in the farm using a low-power wireless communications (e.g., ZigBee, LPWA). However, in these systems, even when the low-power wireless technology is utilized, it is difficult to run permanently on batteries because the battery capacity is not infinity. In addition, in the case of a large-scale field, a large number of intermediate nodes should be installed in the field, hence the installation and operation costs are high. On the other hand, a wireless power transfer technology is evolving and equipment which is capable of supplying power to places dozens of centimeters away has been available. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) that can fly stably for a long time and has a large loading capacity has appeared. Therefore, in this study, we propose and develop a wide-area sensing system for large-scale farms using a UAV, a wireless power transfer technology, and an energy-saving short-range wireless communication system (i.e., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)). The UAV flies autonomously to the location of sensor nodes that are widely installed in the large farm for collecting the sensor data. Here, the UAV is designed to supply the power to the sensor node to measure and send the environmental information using the wireless power transfer technology. It eliminates the need for periodic battery replacement of the sensor node, which reduces the cost of operating the system. Through the experimental evaluation using the developed system, it has been confirmed that the UAV can accurately be controlled by the proposed feedback control to land near the sensor nodes, and that the sensor nodes can be operated by the wireless power transfer from the embedded system of the UAV.

This system allows OSA patients to get timely rescue when they become sleepy outside. Because the Beidou position marker has an interactive function, it can reduce the anxiety of the patient while waiting for the rescue. At the same time, if a friend helps the OSA patients to call the doctor, the friend can also report the patient's condition in time. This system uses the popular IoT framework. At the bottom is the data acquisition layer, which uses wearable sensors to collect vital signs from patients, with a focus on ECG and SpO2 signals. The middle layer is the network layer that transmits the collected physiological signals to the Beidou indicator using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The top layer is the application layer, and the application layer uses the mature rescue interactive platform of Beidou. The Beidou system was developed by China itself, the main coverage of the satellite is in Asia, and is equipped with a high-density ground-based augmentation system. Therefore, the Beidou model improves the positioning accuracy and is equipped with a special communication satellite, which increases the short message interaction function. Therefore, patients can report disease progression in time while waiting for a rescue. After our simulation test, the effectiveness of the OSA patient rescue monitoring system based on the Beidou system and the positioning accuracy of OSA patients have been greatly improved. Especially when OSA patients work outdoors, the cell phone base station signal coverage is relatively weak. The satellite signal is well-covered, plus the SMS function of the Beidou indicator. Therefore, the system can be used to provide timely patient progress and provide data support for the medical rescue team to provide a more accurate rescue plan. After a comparative trial, the rescue rate of OSA patients using the detection device of this system was increased by 15 percentage points compared with the rescue rate using only GPS satellite phones.

C	Depatla, S; Mostofi, Y			IEEE	Depatla, Saandeep; Mostofi, Yasamin			Occupancy Analytics in Retail Stores Using Wireless Signals	2019 16TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SENSING, COMMUNICATION, AND NETWORKING (SECON)	Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking Workshops.		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (IEEE SECON)	JUN 10-13, 2019	NE Univ, Inst Wireless Internet Things, Boston, MA	IEEE, Natl Sci Fdn, NE Univ Coll Engn, IEEE Commun Soc	NE Univ, Inst Wireless Internet Things			In this paper, we propose a new framework to estimate the occupancy dynamics of the shoppers over a whole retail store, based on the received power measurements of wireless links that are installed in only a small number of aisles, and without relying on people to carry any device. More specifically, we utilize the received power measurements collected by a small number of wireless links installed in only a few aisles of a retail store and show that we can estimate the rate of arrival of people in all the aisles of the retail store. We first show how a pair of wireless links in an aisle can estimate the rate of arrival of people into that aisle for the general case where people can have a bi-directional flow. We then propose a new framework to estimate the rate of arrival of people into all the aisles of the retail store, using the received power measurements of a number of wireless links that are installed in only a few aisles. Our proposed approach utilizes the sparsity in the spatial and temporal gradient of the occupancy dynamics and poses an optimization problem to estimate the arrival rates over the whole store based only on a very small number of wireless measurements. We thoroughly validate our framework with several experiments in three different retail stores - Kmart and two anonymous retail stores (Store-2 and Store-3), using the RSSI measurements of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Chips. Our results confirm that our framework can accurately estimate the rate of arrival of people into different aisles of a retail store with minimal wireless sensing. More specifically, we show that our approach can estimate the rate of arrival of people in different aisles of a store, with an average root mean square of 0.03 people/minute, when averaged over all the aisles and all the time, and while reducing the number of required wireless links by 57%.

J	D'Ortona, C; Tarchi, D; Raffaelli, C				D'Ortona, Cristian; Tarchi, Daniele; Raffaelli, Carla			Open-Source MQTT-Based End-to-End IoT System for Smart City Scenarios	FUTURE INTERNET			English	Article						Internet of Things; Smart Cities; MQTT; BLE; Android; Raspberry PI; open-source		Many innovative services are emerging based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, aiming at fostering better sustainability of our cities. New solutions integrating Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) with sustainable transport media are encouraged by several public administrations in the so-called Smart City scenario, where heterogeneous users in city roads call for safer mobility. Among several possible applications, recently, there has been a lot of attention on the so-called Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians or bikers. They can be equipped with wearable sensors that are able to communicate their data through a chain of devices towards the cloud for agile and effective control of their mobility. This work describes a complete end-to-end IoT system implemented through the integration of different complementary technologies, whose main purpose is to monitor the information related to road users generated by wearable sensors. The system has been implemented using an ESP32 micro-controller connected to the sensors and communicating through a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface with an Android device, which is assumed to always be carried by any road user. Based on this, we use it as a gateway node, acting as a real-time asynchronous publisher of a Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol chain. The MQTT broker is configured on a Raspberry PI device and collects sensor data to be sent to a web-based control panel that performs data monitoring and processing. All the architecture modules have been implemented through open-source technologies. The analysis of the BLE packet exchange has been carried out by resorting to the Wireshark packet analyzer. In addition, a feasibility analysis has been carried out by showing the capability of the proposed solution to show the values gathered through the sensors on a remote dashboard. The developed system is publicly available to allow the possible integration of other modules for additional Smart City services or extension to further ICT applications.

The next fast growing opportunity market will be the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wearable Deivces in the near future. This advanced technology/package need to provide the ideal solution for small form factor, thin profile, high electrical performance, multi-function integration and low cost are the most critical requirements. To approach these requirements, the System in Package (SiP) is a combination of one or more semiconductor devices plus optionally passive components that define a certain functional block within a small package, mounted onto the system's main board assembly. SiP can be integrated multi-function chips into a single package and offer a small form factor and a low cost system solution for many wireless connectivity applications. In this paper, an alternative 3D small form factor SiP methodology will use surface mount technology (SMT) and 3D structure of stacking die on passives to shrink the package size. The calculation of package size can be shrunk around 25% area and package size reduced from 11.5 x 11.5mm to 10x10mm. For the experiment including the DOE (Design of Experiment) study for the passive quantities optimization and also die tilt performance between different passive quantities. By utilizing exiting package solutions (such as wire bond, flip chip, hybrid or stacked die process), a SiP module provide a unique opportunity to address cost, performance, and time-to-market. Considering the limitations of power consumption and form factor, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and wireless connectivity module will become the major requirements for SiP platforms in near marketing. The characterization analysis will utilize simulation methodology & typical reliability testing (Temperature Cycle Test, High Temperature Storage Test, unbias HAST) results as a verification for 3D stacking die on passives of SiP feasibility structure. Finally, this paper will find out the suitable 3D stacking die on passives of SiP structure and feasibility data for future IoT and wearable devices application.

J	Arslan, M; Cruz, C; Ginhac, D				Arslan, Muhammad; Cruz, Christophe; Ginhac, Dominique			Visualizing intrusions in dynamic building environments for worker safety	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						Construction safety; BLE beacons; Intrusions; BIM; Workers; Near-miss	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; STRUCK-BY; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; SEMANTIC TRAJECTORIES; LOCATION TRACKING; MISS INTERACTIONS; SMART BUILDINGS; WARNING SYSTEM; SITE SAFETY	A review of the existing literature suggests that intrusions on sites are often overlooked as current construction safety assessment methods are primarily focused on visible consequences such as injuries and deaths. Moreover, traditional Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) methods for improving worker attitude towards adopting safety practices on work sites are not adequate as these methods do not provide quick feedback for changing unsafe worker behaviors in real-time to avoid fatalities. Consequently, geo-localization systems are used for acquiring spatio-temporal trajectories to identify unsafe worker behaviors on construction sites. However, spatio-temporal trajectories lack contextual building or site information. For incorporating the geographical and application-specific context in trajectories, semantic enrichment processes are executed. The semantic enrichment process should include changing contextual information related to the evolving building objects over time. The changing contextual information of building objects is required to be tracked by a system to study the worker behaviors in a dynamic building environment context. After reviewing the existing literature, it is concluded that none of the present systems offer a mechanism to identify unsafe worker behaviors such as intrusions in dynamic environments where the contextual information of building spaces evolves over time in terms of location, size, properties and relationships with the environment. To fill this research gap, a system is proposed; First, to acquire the worker movements using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Second, to perform the pre-processing as well as semantically enriching the spatio-temporal worker trajectories using relevant updated contextual information of a building. Lastly, to visualize the building locations where intrusions have occurred using Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach. The developed system presents an integration of systems from the data acquisition stage to visualizing the unsafe work behaviors that could serve as a foundation for future research in studying advanced movement-related worker behaviors in dynamic environments by overcoming the spatio-temporal data management challenges.

A mobile system for sedentary behaviors classification based on accelerometer and location data	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						Sedentary behaviors classification; Data mining; Sensor mining; Accelerometer; BLE beacons	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY	Background: Sedentary behaviors are associated to the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Accelerometers and inclinometers have been used to estimate sedentary behaviors, however a major limitation is that these devices do not provide enough contextual information in order to recognize the specific sedentary behavior performed, e.g., sitting or lying watching TV, using the PC, sitting at work, driving, etc. Objective: Propose and evaluate the precision of a mobile system for objectively measuring six sedentary behaviors using accelerometer and location data. Results: The system is implemented as an Android Mobile App, which identifies individual's sedentary behaviors based on accelerometer data taken from the smartphone or a smartwatch, and symbolic location data obtained from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The system infers sedentary behaviors by means of a supervised Machine Learning Classifier. The precision of the classification of five of the six studied sedentary behaviors exceeded 95% using accelerometer data from a smartwatch attached to the wrist and 98% using accelerometer data from a smartphone put into the pocket. Statistically significant improvement in the average precision of the classification due to the use of BLE beacons was found by comparing the precision of the classification using accelerometer data only, and BLE beacons localization technology. Conclusions: The proposed system provides contextual information of specific sedentary behaviors by inferring with very high precision the physical location where the sedentary event occurs. Moreover, it was found that, when accelerometers are put in the user's pocket, instead of the wrist and, when symbolic location is inferred using BLE beacons; the precision in the classification is improved. In practice, the proposed system has the potential to contribute to the understanding of the context and determinants of sedentary behaviors, necessary for the implementation and monitoring of personalized noncommunicable diseases prevention programs, for instance, sending sedentary behavior alerts, or providing personalized recommendations on physical activity. The system could be used at work to promote active breaks and healthy habits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Emphasis is placed on the accuracy and range of different localization and location-sharing methods, particularly in forested environments and in the absence of conventional cellular or internet connectivity. We then conduct a second review of literature and concepts related to several emerging, broad themes in data science, including the terms location-based services (LBS), geofences, wearable technology, activity recognition, mesh networking, the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Our objective in this second review is to inform how these broader concepts, with implications for networking and analytics, may help to advance natural resource management and science in the future. Based on methods, themes, and concepts that arose in our systematic reviews, we then augmented the paper with additional literature from wildlife and fisheries management, as well as concepts from video object detection, relative positioning, and inventory-tracking that are also used as forms of localization. Based on our reviews of positioning technologies and emerging data science themes, we present a hierarchical model for collecting and sharing data in forest and fire management, and more broadly in the field of natural resources. The model reflects tradeoffs in range and bandwidth when recording, processing, and communicating large quantities of data in time and space to support resource management, science, and public safety in remote areas. In the hierarchical approach, wearable devices and other sensors typically transmit data at short distances using Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or ANT wireless, and smartphones and tablets serve as intermediate data collection and processing hubs for information that can be subsequently transmitted using radio networking systems or satellite communication. Data with greater spatial and temporal complexity is typically processed incrementally at lower tiers, then fused and summarized at higher levels of incident command or resource management. Lastly, we outline several priority areas for future research to advance big data analytics in natural resources.

Hardware Prototype for Wrist-Worn Simultaneous Monitoring of Environmental, Behavioral, and Physiological Parameters	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						safety monitoring; chronic diseases; smart wearables; ambient physiological monitoring; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); unobtrusive health monitoring	INTEGRATED CARE; AIR-POLLUTION; COPD PATIENTS; HEALTH; TECHNOLOGY; MORTALITY; PLATFORM; DEVICES; SYSTEM	We designed a low-cost wrist-worn prototype for simultaneously measuring environmental, behavioral, and physiological domains of influencing factors in healthcare. Our prototype continuously monitors ambient elements (sound level, toxic gases, ultraviolet radiation, air pressure, temperature, and humidity), personal activity (motion tracking and body positioning using gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer), and vital signs (skin temperature and heart rate). An innovative three-dimensional hardware, based on the multi-physical-layer approach is introduced. Using board-to-board connectors, several physical hardware layers are stacked on top of each other. All of these layers consist of integrated and/or add-on sensors to measure certain domain (environmental, behavioral, or physiological). The prototype includes centralized data processing, transmission, and visualization. Bi-directional communication is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and can connect to smartphones as well as smart cars and smart homes for data analytic and adverse-event alerts. This study aims to develop a prototype for simultaneous monitoring of the all three areas for monitoring of workplaces and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with a concentration on technical development and validation rather than clinical investigation. We have implemented 6 prototypes which have been tested by 5 volunteers. We have asked the subjects to test the prototype in a daily routine in both indoor (workplaces and laboratories) and outdoor. We have not imposed any specific conditions for the tests. All presented data in this work are from the same prototype. Eleven sensors measure fifteen parameters from three domains. The prototype delivers the resolutions of 0.1 part per million (PPM) for air quality parameters, 1 dB, 1 index, and 1 degrees C for sound pressure level, UV, and skin temperature, respectively. The battery operates for 12.5 h under the maximum sampling rates of sensors without recharging. The final expense does not exceed 133euro.

This can be attributed to unstable received signal strengths (RSS) of the underlying RF signal, which is enlarged with the increased physical scale and the complexity of the indoor space. In this paper, instead of RF signal we use the geomagnetic sensor signal for indoor localization, whose signal strength is more stable than RF RSS. Our approach using the geomagnetic field is as follows. Although similar geomagnetic field values exist in indoor space, an object movement would experience a unique sequence of the geomagnetic field signals as the movement continues. We can locate the position of the object by tracking the geomagnetic field signal sequence sensed with the object movement by using a deep neural network model called recurrent neural network (RNN), which is good at recognizing time varying sequence of sensor data. We use two different versions of RNN model: basic RNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We have trained RNNs to learn the magnetic field maps of both medium scale (about 94m x 26m) and large scale (about 608m x 50m area) indoor testbeds and analyze both training and test set results by tuning several training hyperparameters. For comparison, we have also implemented both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi based fingerprinting localization techniques and measured their localization accuracies for the testbeds. By using Google TensorFlow 1.6 and Nvdia CUDA Toolkit v9.0 with cuDNN v7.1 library as a deep learning framework, we could achieve the average localization accuracy of 0.51 and 1.04 meters for the medium and the large-scale testbeds respectively with LSTM model, substantially improving the localization performance compared to the existing RF based fingerprinting techniques.

They are essential for qualifications the arterial stiffness and change blood pressure. Can be useful to detect sleep respiratory events or microarousals. The article proposes two concepts aimed at solving the issue of measuring pulse wave velocity PWV and pulse transit time PTT. The first concept focuses on the measurement of the pulse wave and the ECG signal, necessary to determine PWV, with one of the measurement modules. The second concept consists in the use of two separate modules, integrated in the wireless WBAN network system. The secondary module is responsible for the acquisition of the pulse signal in this method. The primary module (integrator) synchronizes the operation of both modules in the WBAN network, acquires the ECG signal, as well as calculates PWV and PTT, and other significant parameters. The integrator also permits wireless communication with external systems. The paper presents the way in which the measurements were made, research into the use of the first method, and the current works to adjust the modules to the implementation of the second concept.

Most existing unattended parking lots suffer from a lack of seamless automation, instead deploying ticketing and payment at ingress and egress points or other systems with heavy user involvement that often form bottlenecks. Similarly, many lots use per-space sensing with expensive networking and power requirements simply to determine space occupancy. Parking solutions that are free from the delay caused by this user burden and infrastructure could experience faster occupancy turnover with lower cost. An ongoing challenge in developing seamless parking experiences is the detection and identification of vehicles in parking spaces without the need for complex and expensive per-space occupancy detection technology. We develop a smart parking solution that uses a single lowpower wireless radio technology to seamlessly perform parked vehicle localization and transport of sensor data for use by a central management system. Our solution uses a sparse, self-forming network of dual-mode Bluetooth sensors within a parking area to observe the presence of customized authenticated Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons placed in vehicles parked in the lot. Our localization technique is based on radio fingerprinting using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values from the beacon, and a random forest machine learning classifier that predicts where the vehicle is parked based on its fingerprint. We implemented our solution in Python on commodity Internet of Things (IoT) hardware and deployed it to a 105 space outdoor parking lot. There, we conducted fingerprinting and prediction experiments. Our results show that our exact-space prediction model evaluates with a high accuracy using radio training data (90.7% correctly identified), and our in-vehicle tests show a promising result (69.17% accurate up to and including 3 spaces away), even without employing tuning and data filtering techniques. This encouraging result shows that localization using Bluetooth is a viable means of managing parked vehicles, with great promise for a variety of future parking management applications.

The antenna size should respect the planar dimensions of 60 mm x 30 mm to be integrated with small IoT devices such as a Bluetooth Lower Energy Sensing Node. The provided design is based on a folded short-circuited dipole antenna, also named a T-match antenna. Faced with the difficulty of reducing the physical dimensions of the antenna, we propose a 3D configuration by adding vertical metallic arms on the edges of the antenna. The adopted 3D design has an overall size of 56 mm x 32 mm x 10 mm at 868 MHz. Three antenna-feeding techniques were evaluated to characterize this antenna. They consist of soldering a U.FL connector on the input port; vertically connecting a tapered balun to the antenna; and integrating a microstrip transition to the layer of the antenna. The experimental results of the selected feeding techniques show good agreements and the antenna has a maximum gain of +1.54 dBi in the elevation plane (E-plane). In addition, a final modification was operated to the designed antenna to have a more compact structure with a size of 40 mm x 30 mm x 10 mm at 868 MHz. Such modification reduces the radiation surface of the antenna and so the antenna gain and bandwidth. This antenna can achieve a maximum gain of +1.1 dBi in the E-plane. The two antennas proposed in this paper were then associated with a rectifier to perform energy harvesting for powering Bluetooth Low Energy wireless sensors. The measured RF-DC (radiofrequency to direct current) conversion efficiency is 73.88% (first design) and 60.21% (second design) with an illuminating power density of 3.1 mu W/cm(2) at 868 MHz with a 10 k omega load resistor.

In general, IoT opens the door to a myriad of applications but also to many challenges. One of the major challenges is how to efficiently retrieve the sensory data from "resources-limited" IoT devices. Such devices typically have a restricted energy budget, which broadly hinders their direct connection to the Internet. In this realm, modern mobile devices, e.g. smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, have been harnessed to bridge between the low-power IoT devices and the Internet. However, the current vision which mainly relies on designing siloed gateways, i.e. a separate gateway/App for each IoT device, is certainly impractical, especially with the rapid growth in the number of IoT devices. Furthermore, energy efficiency of the smart mobile devices hosting the IoT gateways has to be thoroughly considered. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GaaS (Gateway as a Service), a cross-platform gateway architecture for opportunistically retrieving sensory data from the low-power IoT sensors. Through Bluetooth low energy radios, GaaS is capable of simultaneously connecting to several nearby IoT sensors. To this end, we devise two distinct priority-based scheduling algorithms, namely the EP-WSM and FEP-AHP schedulers, which rank the detected IoT sensors, before estimating the connection time for each IoT sensor. The intuition behind ranking the IoT sensors is to improve the data retrieval rate from these sensors together with reducing the energy overhead on the mobile devices. Additionally, GaaS encompasses a self-adaptive engine to automatically balance the trade-off between energy efficiency and data retrieval rate through switching between schedulers according to the runtime dynamics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GaaS, we implemented an IoT testbed to evaluate the energy consumption, the latency, and the data retrieval rate. The results show that using GaaS, compared to siloed gateways, we can identify up to 18% savings in the consumed energy while requiring much less data retrieval time.

Value co-creation (VCC) is not limited to outcomes, especially in interpersonal services based on interactions between actors. In this paper, a sensing framework for a VCC process in retail stores is proposed by improving an environment recognition based indoor positioning system with high positioning performance in a metal shelf environment. The conventional indoor positioning systems use radio waves; therefore, errors are caused by reflection, absorption, and interference from metal shelves. An improvement in positioning performance was achieved in the proposed method by using an IR (infrared) slit and IR light, which avoids such errors. The system was designed to recognize many and unspecified people based on the environment recognition method that the receivers had installed, in the service environment. In addition, sensor networking was also conducted by adding a function to transmit payload and identification simultaneously to the beacons that were attached to positioning objects. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by installing it not only in an experimental environment with ideal conditions, but posteriorly, the system was tested in real conditions, in a retail store. In our experimental setup, in a comparison with equal element numbers, positioning identification was possible within an error of 96.2 mm in a static environment in contrast to the radio wave based method where an average positioning error of approximately 648 mm was measured using the radio wave based method (Bluetooth low-energy fingerprinting technique). Moreover, when multiple beacons were used simultaneously in our system within the measurement range of one receiver, the appropriate setting of the pulse interval and jitter rate was implemented by simulation. Additionally, it was confirmed that, in a real scenario, it is possible to measure the changes in movement and positional relationships between people. This result shows the feasibility of measuring and evaluating the VCC process in retail stores, although it was difficult to measure the interaction between actors.

In particular, location awareness using wireless communication is gaining attention in indoor environments composed of many obstacles, where GPS signals cannot reach. Previously, studies have focused mostly on location precision, which resulted in using many beacon nodes, not considering the initial installation and maintenance costs, communication robustness, or power consumption. This makes it difficult to apply existing methods to various fields, especially in mobile nodes (i.e., wearable devices, mobile tags, etc.) with limited battery capacity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid situation-aware indoor localization (SAIL) system for real-time indoor localization using a combination of low frequency (LF) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0. This approach allows us to work with limited battery capacity mobile devices, and identify tagged mobile nodes and their current location in relevance to the anchor node. In our experiment, we attached one anchor node at the entrance to indoor areas such as office or factory settings. Using our hybrid SAIL system, we were able to detect the passing of a mobile node through the entrance and recognize whether the node is entering or exiting the room by calculating the direction of movement as well as the distance from the entrance. This allowed us to distinguish the precise position in an indoor environment with the margin of error being 0.5 m. The signal attenuation due to obstacles is overcome by using LF communication in the 125-kHz band. This approach enables us to reduce the number of initially installed anchor nodes as well as the power consumption of the mobile node. We propose an indoor position recognition system, namely, the hybrid SAIL system, that can be applied to mobile nodes with limited battery capacity by reducing the system complexity and power consumption.

Localization within Hostile Indoor Environments for Emergency Responders	SENSORS			English	Article						IoT; localization; indoor navigation; sensors	POSITIONING SYSTEMS; NAVIGATION; SUPPORT	Recent advances in techniques to improve indoor localization accuracy for personnel and asset tracking challenges has enabled wide-spread adoption within the retail, manufacturing, and health care industries. Most currently deployed systems use distance estimates from known reference locations to localize a person or asset using geometric lateration techniques. The distances are determined using one of many radio frequency (RF) based ranging techniques. Unfortunately, such techniques are susceptible to interference and multipath propagation caused by obstructions within buildings. Because range inaccuracies from known locations can directly lead to incorrect position estimates, these systems often require careful upfront deployment design to account for site-specific interference sources. However, the upfront system deployment requirements necessary to achieve high positioning accuracy with RF-based ranging systems makes the use of such systems impractical, particularly for structures constructed of challenging materials or dense configurations. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the accuracy and precision of alternative RF-based devices within a range of indoor spaces composed of different materials and sizes. These spaces range from large open areas such as gymnasiums to confined engineering labs of traditional buildings as well as training buildings at the local Fire Department Training Facility. Our goal is to identify the impact of alternative RF-based systems on localization accuracy and precision specifically for first responders that are called upon to traverse structures composed of different materials and configurations. Consequently, in this study we have specifically chosen spaces that are likely to be encountered by firefighters during building fires or emergency medical responses. Moreover, many of these indoor spaces can be considered hostile using RF-based ranging techniques. We built prototype wearable localization edge devices designed for first responders and characterize both ranging and localization accuracy and precision using alternative transceivers including Bluetooth Low Energy, 433 MHz, 915 MHz, and ultra-wide band. Our results show that in hostile environments, using ultra-wide band transceivers for localization consistently outperforms the alternatives in terms of precision and accuracy.

The designed device is based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and NFC connectivity. BLE is used to exchange data with a gateway, whereas NFC has been chosen as an energy-efficient wake-up mechanism. A temperature and humidity sensor is embedded to monitor storage conditions and an accelerometer for tool usage monitoring. The ARM Cortex-M4 core embedded in the BLE module is exploited to process the information at the edge. A Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithm is proposed to process the data directly on board and achieve low latency and high energy efficiency. The TinyML algorithm has been developed embedded in the proposed device to detect four different usage classes (tool transportation, no-load, metal, and wood drilling). A dataset containing more than 280 min of three-axis accelerations during different activities has been acquired with the device attached to a construction rotary hammer drill and used to train and validate the algorithm. A neural architecture search has been performed to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and complexity, achieving an accuracy of 90.6% with a model size of roughly 30 kB. The experimental results showed an ultralow power consumption in sleep mode of 550 nA and a peak power consumption of 8 mA while running TinyML on the edge. This results in a balanced combination of edge processing capabilities and low power consumption, enabling to obtain a smart Internet of Things (IoT) device in the field with a long lifetime of up to four years in operation and 17 years in shelf mode with a standard 250-mAh coin battery. This work enables a long battery lifetime operation of device degradation and utility analysis, further closing the gap between edge processing and fine granularity data evaluation.

Finding the correct floor, in a fast and efficient manner, in a shopping mall or an unknown university building can save the users' search time and can enable a myriad of Location Based Services in the future. One of the most widely spread techniques for floor estimation in multi-floor buildings is the fingerprinting-based localization using Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements coming from indoor networks, such as WLAN and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The clear advantage of RSS-based floor estimation is its ease of implementation on a multitude of mobile devices at the Application Programming Interface (API) level, because RSS values are directly accessible through API interface. However, the downside of a fingerprinting approach, especially for largescale floor estimation and positioning solutions, is their need to store and transmit a huge amount of fingerprinting data. The problem becomes more severe when the localization is intended to be done on mobile devices (smart phones, tablets, etc.) which have limited memory, power, and computational resources. An alternative floor estimation method, which has lower complexity and is faster than the fingerprinting is the Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) method. The trade-off is however paid in terms of a lower accuracy than the one obtained with traditional fingerprinting with Nearest Neighbour (NN) estimates. In this paper a novel K-means -based method for floor estimation via fingerprint clustering of WiFi and various other positioning sensor outputs is introduced. Our method achieves a floor estimation accuracy close to the one with NN fingerprinting, while significantly improves the complexity and the speed of the floor detection algorithm. The decrease in the database size is achieved through storing and transmitting only the cluster heads (CH's) and their corresponding floor labels. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using reallife indoor measurements taken from four multi-floor buildings. The numerical results show that the proposed K-means -based method offers an excellent trade-off between the complexity and performance.

C	Kuo, YT			Inst Navigat	Kuo, Yun-Tzu			An Experimental Study of an Improved BLE Indoor Positioning Scheme Based on Differential Distance Correction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 31ST INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS+ 2018)	Institute of Navigation Satellite Division Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	31st International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division-of-The-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS)	SEP 24-28, 2018	Miami, FL	Inst Navigat, Satellite Div				Indoor positioning has attracted much attention in recent years due to the trend of Internet of Things (IoT), which is capable of providing numerous applications such as personal tracking, vehicle locator, and Location-Based Service (LBS). Since Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is no longer useful in the indoor environment because of the sheltered satellite signals, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a good alternative for realizing indoor positioning. BLE, the latest version of Bluetooth in 2010, has the advantages of low cost, low power consumption, and pervasive availability in smartphones. However, BLE still faces some challenges in terms of the fluctuating Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) caused by the environment such as reflection, fading and multipath effect. Those variable RSSI values make it difficult to derive positioning result accurately. To reduce the environmental effect, the concepts of Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) and Network Real Time Kinematic ( NRTK) motivate a novel method named Differential Distance Correction proposed in this study. This method utilizes the differential information from the reference station at the known coordinate to correct the distance measurement of the rover station and further enhance the positioning accuracy of it. In this study, power regression model is used to convert RSSI to distance; then Differential Distance Correction is applied to obtain better distance measurements of the rover. In addition, trilateration is selected as the primary positioning technique, which exploits estimated distances to determine the target's position. This technique can be solved by two main approaches: linear and nonlinear least squares. With corrected distance measurements, it can gain more accurate result through trilateration compared with simply using the original distances. The experimental results presented in this study illustrate that the overall positioning error using the proposed method can be reduced to less than 2.5 m in 90% positioning error, and 2 m in RMSE with both improvement ratios over 30%.

The development of localization tools, methods and frameworks enables current communication services and applications to be optimized by incorporating location data. For clinical applications such as workflow analysis, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been employed to map the positions of individuals in indoor environments. To map locations, certain existing methods use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Devices need to be configured to allow for dynamic interference patterns when using the RSSI sensors to monitor indoor positions. In this paper, our objective is to explore an alternative method for monitoring a moving user's indoor position using BLE sensors in complex indoor building environments. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based positioning model based on the 2D image composed of the received number of signals indicator from both x and y-axes. In this way, like a pixel, we interact with each 10 x 10 matrix holding the spatial information of coordinates and suggest the possible shift of a sensor, adding a sensor and removing a sensor. To develop CNN we adopted a neuro-evolution approach to optimize and create several layers in the network dynamically, through enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). For the optimization of CNN, the global best solution obtained by PSO is directly given to the weights of each layer of CNN. In addition, we employed dynamic inertia weights in the PSO, instead of a constant inertia weight, to maintain the CNN layers' length corresponding to the RSSI signals from BLE sensors. Experiments were conducted in a building environment where thirteen beacon devices had been installed in different locations to record coordinates. For evaluation comparison, we further adopted machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting a user's location in an indoor environment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed optimized CNN-based method shows high accuracy (97.92% with 2.8% error) for tracking a moving user's locations in a complex building without complex calibration as compared to other recent methods.

To achieve these goals, it is necessary to enable a homogenous and seamless machine-to-machine (M2M) communication mechanism allowing global access to devices, sensors and smart objects. In this respect, the proposed answer to these technological requirements is called Glowbal IF, which is based on a homogeneous access to the devices/sensors offered by the IPv6 addressing and core network. Glowbal IP's main advantages with regard to 6LoWPAN/IPv6 are not only that it presents a low overhead to reach a higher performance on a regular basis, but also that it determines the session and identifies global access by means of a session layer defined over the application layer. Technologies without any native support for IP are thereby adaptable to JP e.g. IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy. This extension towards the IPv6 network opens access to the features and methods of the devices through a homogenous access based on WebServices (e.g. RESTFul/CoAP). In addition to this, Glowbal IP offers global interoperability among the different devices, and interoperability with external servers and users applications. All in all, it allows the storage of information related to the devices in the network through the extension of the Domain Name System (DNS) from the IPv6 core network, by adding the Service Directory extension (DNS-SD) to store information about the sensors, their properties and functionality. A step forward in network-based information systems is thereby reached, allowing a homogenous discovery, and access to the devices from the IoT. Thus, the IoT capabilities are exploited by allowing an easier and more transparent integration of the end users applications with sensors for the future evaluations and use cases.

The car's Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can unlock the door or trunk, and it can also start the engine depending on the key fob's positions and the command received from the key. In this paper, we use smartphone with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to implement the next-generation PEPS system, replacing the LF/UHF technology and the physical key fob used in the existing PEPS system. With BLE fingerprinting, we can estimate the position of a smartphone by comparing BLE signal strengths of the current location with pre-recorded signal strengths of reference points. However, unlike the existing indoor localization, BLE-based PEPS systems need to consider the impact of changing environment due to the mobility of a vehicle since BLE signal strength is highly affected by surrounding environment such as neighboring cars and walls. If pre-recorded environment and the actual environment are different, localization accuracy can be greatly reduced. To address this issue we propose a new BLE-based localization scheme that can estimate the surrounding environment of the vehicle through beacons and scanners attached to the vehicle. We have evaluated our proposed BLE-based PEPS system by using Hyundai LF Sonata as a test vehicle. For comparative evaluation, we also test BLE ranging model, which determines the smartphone position depending on the strength and the type of detected beacons. In an open space testbed with no neighboring vehicles, the ranging model produces 90.1% positioning accuracy on average. In contrast, the proposed BLE-fingerprinting model achieves 94.6% accuracy on average without dark areas. In addition, in the same testbed with neighboring vehicles, the proposed BLE-fingerprinting PEPS system achieves 90.5% accuracy on average with environment adaptation while only 62% accuracy without environmental knowledge.

Thus far, researchers have tried to adapt various short range technologies such as IEEE802.15.4, classical Bluetooth etc., to achieve this goal. The IEEE802.15.4 was, by excellence, widely deployed because of its low power and its security features compared to technologies such as the classical Bluetooth. However, the Bluetooth Special Interest group has recently announced Bluetooth 4.0 with low energy technology (BLE) for low power personal area networked devices, which offers more compelling features in various aspects when compared to IEEE802.15.4. This makes its evaluation for healthcare applications an urgently needed endeavour. In this paper, we present a BLE-based remote health monitoring system in which we have interfaced an ECG simulator directly to a BLE enabled CC2540 wireless sensor node (a system-on-chip (SoC) for Bluetooth low energy applications, from Texas Instruments). The node acts as a slave to the Master BLE device. In our system, we have used a BLE112 module (from Bluegiga) as a slave node while for the master we have used a BLE USB dongle connected to a PC in order to manage data received from the sensor node. A server application running on the PC uses a TCP-based connection over the network interface in order to enable remote monitoring. Any remote client can connect to the server and receives live updates from the sensor node. We have developed a LabVIEW based TCP client application to provide this functionality. An ECG simulator was used to generate ECG signals for different heartbeat rates that were sent through the BLE enabled network. The waveforms received at remote station using the developed system were found to conform exactly to those captured using a high resolution oscilloscope. (C) 2013 The Authors.

A wireless charging system that utilizes the piezoelectricity generated as a power source and integrated with Qi-standard wireless transmission would substantially affect the environment and the users. The approach consists of a full-wave-rectified piezoelectric generation, battery storage, Qi-standard wireless transmission, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as the controller and application monitor. Three main functions are involved in the design of the proposed system: power generation, power storage, and power transmission. A client application is conceived to monitor the transmission and receipt of data. The piezoelectric elements generate the AC electricity from the mechanical movements, which converts the electricity to DC using the full-wave bridge rectifiers. The sensor transmits the data to the application via BLE protocols. The user receives continuous updates regarding the storage level, paired devices, and remaining time for a complete charge. A Qi-standard wireless transmitter transfers the stored electricity to charge the respective devices. The output generates pulses to 60 voltage on each compression of a transducer. The design is based on multiple parallel configurations to solve the issue of charging up to the triggering value VH = 5.2 V when tested with a single piezoelectric transducer. AA-type battery cells are charged in parallel in a series configuration. The system is tested for a number of scenarios. In addition, we simulate the design for 11.11 h for approximately 70,000 joules of input. The system can charge from 5% to 100% and draw from 98%. Using four piezos in the designed module results in an average output voltage of 1.16 V. Increasing the number of piezos results in 17.2 W of power. The system is able to wirelessly transmit and store power with a stable power status after less than 0.01 s.

We envision a scenario, in which batteryless sensors placed on small body parts (e.g., on-finger, in-ear, and in-mouth) can obtain operating power from another body-worn energy sources (e.g., already existing battery-powered wearable devices such as a smartwatch or a BandAid-like battery patch attached to the neck). The key technical challenges in realizing this vision include 1) providing a robust return path in the body channel - where the forward (power signal) and return (ground) paths are not explicitly defined - using implicit capacitances formed between the devices and earth ground, and 2) achieving reliable operation despite variations in capacitive coupling between the skin and devices, devices and earth ground, and conductance of the subdermal layer. We identify and optimize critical system design parameters to maximize the power transfer between a transmitter and a receiver with the capacitively coupled return path. To demonstrate and validate the concept of IBPT, we implemented a prototype consisting of 1) a wrist-worn, batteryequipped power transmitter that sends alternating current through the human body and 2) a finger-worn, batteryless sensor device that operates solely on body-transferred power. Evaluations on five subjects show that we can reliably support the power of approximately 1 mW, which can be used to operate an embedded system, continuously collect sensor (e.g. accelerometer) data, and wirelessly transfer the collected data in real-time using Bluetooth Low Energy. Moreover, we achieve a power transfer rate of 14.5% between the transmitter and receiver, which is significantly higher than other wireless power transfer techniques such as RFID. We believe that the proposed system has great potential to transform current architectures and designs for body-area networks, promoting the development of innovative on-body sensors that would otherwise not be possible with on-device batteries.

Fall leads to major injuries, physical disability and sometimes death. Therefore, there is a need to design a dependable embedded system device which will help in detecting the fall and further sends an emergency notification and thus helps in preventing the fall. Many researchers have considered human fall as an unpredictable danger to the life of older generation. Hence lot of research has been done in this area to develop a fall detection system. The existing fall detection systems are efficient but they lack in sensor optimization, early fall detection and efficient wireless communication. In this study, we have demonstrated a pre-fall detection system which detects human falls approximately 250 ms before it occurs. Early fall detection helps in preventing the subject from serious injuries. The designed system monitors user balanced and unbalanced state. Once the unbalance state is detected the system signifies it as a fall, thus gives milliseconds of time to trigger the safety devices like wearable airbag worn by a subject. On fall the system sends emergency notification to the care taker using either Internet of things (IoT) or Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The Hardware system is designed such that it consumes low power and it is a dependable embedded system with easy to wear capabilities for the subject. The designed system uses Arm Processor associated with motion sensors, communication sensors, Signal sensor and MicroSD Card. The software and hardware combination was developed to get optimal low power consumption by switching the CPU between active and sleep mode. The practical experiments performed on the designed system results in giving the 100% sensitivity and 98.07% specificity for fall detection. The wireless communication is efficiently designed such that the power is consumed only when the fall is triggered. The designed system acknowledges the difference between activity of daily living (ADL) like walking, sitting running, and climbing stairs with actual fall.

The economic toll due to higher-temperature, heat stress is a $1 billion annual problemi. Not only in the United States, but also around the globe heat stress causes an adverse impact on dairy productivity. The opportunities, however, for the dairy industry is to electronically monitor cattle temperature and implement appropriate measures so that the impact of HS can be minimized. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates nearly $2.4 billion a year in losses from animal illnesses that lead to death can be prevented by electronically checking on cattle's' vital signs(ii). This research paper recommends the most innovative electronic monitor framework, the 'Smart Connected Objects", aka, 'the Internet of Things (IoT)', that enables dairies to minimize the economic impact of HS and, at the same, capture the higher Return on Assets (ROA) & Return on Investment (ROI) by improving operational efficiencies. Happy Cow, more importantly, means happier, more profitable, dairy industry and richer and creamer dairy products. The proposed framework supports both offline and online dairy IoT.

J	Jiang, XL; Chen, YQ; Liu, JF; Gu, Y; Hu, LS				Jiang, Xinlong; Chen, Yiqiang; Liu, Junfa; Gu, Yang; Hu, Lisha			FSELM: fusion semi-supervised extreme learning machine for indoor localization with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth fingerprints	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fusion semi-supervised learning; Extreme Learning Machine; Indoor localization; Wi-Fi and Bluetooth fingerprints	LOCATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; ELM	Recently, the problem of indoor localization based on WLAN signals is attracting increasing attention due to the development of mobile devices and the widespread construction of networks. However, no definitive solution for achieving a low-cost and accurate positioning system has been found. In most traditional approaches, solving the indoor localization problem requires the availability of a large number of labeled training samples, the collection of which requires considerable manual effort. Previous research has not provided a means of simultaneously reducing human calibration effort and improving location accuracy. This paper introduces fusion semi-supervised extreme learning machine (FSELM), a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the fusion of information from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. Unlike previous semi-supervised methods, which consider multiple signals individually, FSELM fuses multiple signals into a unified model. When applied to sparsely calibrated localization problems, our proposed method is advantageous in three respects. First, it can dramatically reduce the human calibration effort required when using a semi-supervised learning framework. Second, it utilizes fused Wi-Fi and BLE fingerprints to markedly improve the location accuracy. Third, it inherits the beneficial properties of ELMs with regard to training and testing speeds because the input weights and biases of hidden nodes can be generated randomly. As demonstrated by experimental results obtained on practical indoor localization datasets, FSELM possesses a better semi-supervised manifold learning ability and achieves higher location accuracy than several previous batch supervised learning approaches (ELM, BP and SVM) and semi-supervised learning approaches (SELM, S-RVFL and FS-RVFL). Moreover, FSELM needs less training and testing time, making it easier to apply in practice. We conclude through experiments that FSELM yields good results when applied to a multi-signal-based semi-supervised learning problem. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: First, the findings indicate that effective multi-data fusion can be achieved not only through data-layer fusion, feature-layer fusion and decision-layer fusion but also through the fusion of constraints within a model. Second, for semi-supervised learning problems, it is necessary to combine the advantages of different types of data by optimizing the model's parameters.

Traumatic brain injury neuroelectrochemical monitoring: behind-the-ear micro-instrument and cloud application	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury (TBI); Flexible PCB; Wireless brain monitoring; Cloud processing; Microdialysis	SPREADING DEPOLARIZATION; METABOLIC CRISIS; WIRELESS; GLUCOSE; MICRODIALYSIS; LACTATE	Background Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of fatality and disability worldwide, partly due to the occurrence of secondary injury and late interventions. Correct diagnosis and timely monitoring ensure effective medical intervention aimed at improving clinical outcome. However, due to the limitations in size and cost of current ambulatory bioinstruments, they cannot be used to monitor patients who may still be at risk of secondary injury outside the ICU. Methods We propose a complete system consisting of a wearable wireless bioinstrument and a cloud-based application for real-time TBI monitoring. The bioinstrument can simultaneously record up to ten channels including both ECoG biopotential and neurochemicals (e.g. potassium, glucose and lactate), and supports various electrochemical methods including potentiometry, amperometry and cyclic voltammetry. All channels support variable gain programming to automatically tune the input dynamic range and address biosensors' falling sensitivity. The instrument is flexible and can be folded to occupy a small space behind the ear. A Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) receiver is used to wirelessly connect the instrument to a cloud application where the recorded data is stored, processed and visualised in real-time. Bench testing has been used to validate device performance. Results The instrument successfully monitored spreading depolarisations (SDs) - reproduced using a signal generator - with an SNR of 29.07 dB and NF of 0.26 dB. The potentiostat generates a wide voltage range from -1.65V to +1.65V with a resolution of 0.8mV and the sensitivity of the amperometric AFE was verified by recording 5 pA currents. Different potassium, glucose and lactate concentrations prepared in lab were accurately measured and their respective working curves were constructed. Finally,the instrument achieved a maximum sampling rate of 1.25 ksps/channel with a throughput of 105 kbps. All measurements were successfully received at the cloud. Conclusion The proposed instrument uniquely positions itself by presenting an aggressive optimisation of size and cost while maintaining high measurement accuracy. The system can effectively extend neuroelectrochemical monitoring to all TBI patients including those who are mobile and those who are outside the ICU. Finally, data recorded in the cloud application could be used to help diagnosis and guide rehabilitation.

The SHiB is a low cost and easily deployable kit designed to collect data from a wrist-worn wearable in a home environment. The data presented is intended to evaluate room level indoor localization methods. The wearable device registers tri-axial accelerometer measurements which are sampled and transmitted as the payload of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet. Four receiving gateways, each placed in a different room throughout a typical residential house, extract the accelerometer data and determine a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for each received BLE packet. RSSI values can represent propagation losses due to distance or shadowing between the wearable transmitter and the gateway receiver. The dataset is presented in two parts. The first is composed of four calibration or training sequences, carried out by ten participants to offer ground truth calibrations for four rooms in the house. We refer to the calibration phase as the steps taken to gather training data. The calibration procedure was designed to be as straight-forward as possible, to allow a participant to adequately train the SHiB system without supervision. Ten participants each carried out a straight forward calibration procedure once, with four participants carrying out the calibration twice, on different occasions. One participant carried out the calibration on a third occasion. The second part of the data consists of a free-living experiment that was carried out over a period of five and a half hours starting at 7.37 a.m. Of this, one and a half hours of measurements are recorded within a room containing a gateway, where one participant carried out activities of daily living while their ground-truth location was accurately annotated within each room with a gateway present. The calibration data can be used as a training scheme and the living data as a test scenario.

The current approach to diagnosing pneumonia involves the use of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), which contains guidelines for observing high risk signs for early detection. However, due to lack of point of care monitoring devices, these observations are either inaccurate, invalid or costly. Furthermore, several mHealth solutions do not detect this disease and only provide guidelines. In this work, we propose a new low-cost system that captures biomedical data as recommended by doctors to identify Pneumonia. Among the system components, the hub unit is the critical element that collects biometric data from sensors, and samples it. Afterwords, the data is transmitted in real time via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio to a mobile Android-based device. The hub design is based on nRF52832 - Nordic Semiconductors microcontroller due to its low cost and highspeed ADC (i.e., SAADC). The time complexity of all software digital processing and band-pass filtering techniques for the hub is equal to O(1). The design is validated by examining the linear relationship between the applied and calculated frequencies (R-2 = 1). Our real-world analysis reveals that there are more than 70% correlations for the SPO2 data, and more than 90 % correlations for the RR data. This is captured between the gold standard measurements and our device. To further justify the accuracy, the two methods used to demonstrate that they are within the Line of Agreements (LoA) in terms of SpO2, based on Bland Altman analysis (i.e., lower and upper Line of Agreements (LoAs) are equal to and 2:0; respectively). Furthermore, the accuracy in terms of RR is mostly within and 3:6 LoAs. In comparison to the BioSignalPlux hub - PLUX Wireless Biosignals S.A., the battery life of this new design lasts for seven days compared to twenty-four hours for BioSignalPlux. The new hub is compact and can be packaged in a small case.

The system is evaluated in a soybean processing manufacturing facility to identify abnormalities and possible breakdown situations, prevent damage, reduce maintenance costs, and increase production productivity. The system can be used in any other manufacturing or chemical processing facility that make use of motors rotating equipment in different process phases. The system combines condition monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. These algorithms are used with data resulting from the continuous monitoring of relevant production equipment and motor parameters, such as temperature, vibration, sound/noise, and current/voltage. The condition monitoring integrates intelligent Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices with multiple sensors combined with AI-based techniques and edge processing. This is done to identify the parameter modifications and distinctive patterns that occur before a failure and predict forthcoming failure modes before they arise. The data from production equipment/motors is collected wirelessly using different communication protocols - such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE), Long range wide area network (LoRaWAN), and Wi-Fi - and aggregated into an edge computing processing unit via several gateways. The AI-based algorithms are embedded in the processing unit at the edge, allowing the prediction and intelligent control of the production equipment/motor parameters. IIoT devices for environmental sensing, vibration, temperature monitoring, and sound/ultrasound detection are used with embedded signal processing that runs on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. These devices are connected through either wired or wireless protocols. The system described addresses the components necessary for implementing the predictive maintenance (PdM) strategy in soybean industrial processing manufacturing environments. Additionally, it includes new elements that broaden the possibilities for prescriptive maintenance (PsM) developments to be made. The type of ML or DL techniques and algorithms used in maintenance modeling is dictated by the application and available data. The approach presented combines multiple data sources that improve the accuracy of condition monitoring and prediction. DL methods further increase the accuracy and require interpretable and efficient methods as well as the availability of significant amounts of (labeled) data.

For the phase-tracking RX, a hybrid loop filter with a loop-delay compensation is proposed to suppress digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) sidelobe energy, enhancing interference resilience. To facilitate the DCO-based phase-tracking RX for the reception of BT5 signals, a corresponding digital baseband is implemented with a carrier frequency offset (CFO) calibration to remove the initial static CFO error during the preamble, while an automatic frequency calibration tackles the frequency drift during the payload. An all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL)-based digital frequency-modulation (FM) interface shared between TX and RX provides a precise deviation frequency control, ensuring the quality of signal transmission and reception. In the RX mode, the chip consumes 2.3 mW from a 0.8-V supply, achieving a figure of merit (FoM) of 180 dB with -91-/-94-dBm sensitivity at 2/1 Mb/s. In the TX mode, it consumes 6.1 mW when delivering a maximum 1.8-dBm output power, resulting in 25% TX system efficiency.

J	Murillo, Y; Chiumento, A; Reynders, B; Pollin, S				Murillo, Yuri; Chiumento, Alessandro; Reynders, Brecht; Pollin, Sofie			An All-wireless SDN Framework for BLE Mesh	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET OF THINGS			English	Article						SDN; IoT; WSN; BLE; BLE mesh; testbed design; trickle; FruityMesh		The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm combines the interconnection of massive amounts of batteryconstrained and low-computational-power devices with low-latency and high-reliability network requirements. Additionally, diverse end-to-end services and applications with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are expected to coexist in the same network infrastructure. Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a paradigm designed to solve these problems, but its implementation in wireless networks and especially in the resource-constrained IoT systems is extremely challenging and has seen very limited adoption, since it requires isolation of data and control plane information flows and a reliable and scalable control plane. In this work, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh is introduced as an adequate technology for an all-wireless SDNBLE implementation, which is a technology that has become the de-facto standard for IoT. The proposed SDN-BLE framework uses a routing network slice for the data plane information flow and a flooding network slice for the control plane information flow, ensuring their isolation while still being transmitted over the wireless medium. The design and implementation of all the classical SDN layers on a hybrid BLE mesh testbed is given, where the data plane is formed by the BLE nodes and the control plane can be centralized on a server or distributed over severalWiFi gateways. Several controllers are described and implemented, allowing the framework to obtain end-to-end network knowledge to manage individual nodes over the air and configure their behavior to meet application requirements. An experimental characterization of the SDN-BLE framework is given, where the impact of the different parameters of the system on the network reliability, overhead, and energy consumption is studied. Additionally, the distributed versus centralized control plane operation modes are experimentally characterized, and it is shown that the distributed approach can provide the same performance as the centralized one when careful system design is performed. Finally, a proof of concept for the SDN-BLE framework is presented, where a network congestion is automatically detected and the nodes responsible of such congestion are identified and reconfigured over the air, bypassing the congested links, to resume regular network performance.

Thus, data collection and annotation is an important step towards the successful development and realization of such systems. Nevertheless, in order to create reliable datasets, current data collection and annotation methodologies often require a controlled environment while also the presence of the volunteer contributing to the process, or any subject for that matter, and an expert, monitoring the procedure, is mandatory. These processes are heavily restrained by the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. To address such issues, in this paper we propose a human-centered Web-based dataset creation and annotation tool that utilizes the Web Bluetooth API. The user can effectively collect gestures from a nearby device that supports the BLE protocol, assign tags to the collected data, and store them remotely, in real-time. The data storage, as well as its annotation, can also be performed remotely by an expert stakeholder. An off-the-shelf wearable sensorial device has been used indicatively for our tool demonstration purposes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that exploits the Web Bluetooth API capabilities for the development of a Browser-based real-time data collection, storage, and annotation tool. Our tool can be also expanded to other applications that use the sensing device with only minor configuration changes and is also operable through any smart-device that supports a Web-Browser. Furthermore, our tool's performance matches that of native applications'. Finally, the tool is successfully deployed and validated by integrating it into our ongoing ML platform that is related to allergic rhinitis gesture recognition.

Sometimes it happens that there are people who find it difficult to reach a destination in indoors spaces. The attention or personalized guides that help guide in these situations are almost nil in some cases, which causes the user to give up in his search, it consumes a lot of time and generate disinterest in returning to that establishment. This paper presents a solution to the aforementioned problem and is the design and implementation of a system for indoor positioning using Beacon technology. The system consists of two parts, a web application for information management and a mobile application for interaction with beacons in order to guide users to their destinations or display notifications regarding the current location.

However, the installable location of the modules is limited by the presence of surrounding metal objects, since the antenna performance is degraded on metal surfaces. This research focuses on the use of artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) as a small antenna that maintains its performance on metal. The characteristics of AMC consisting of few cells were determined, and the size was able to be reduced by introducing a pair of electric walls. It was also shown that with this design, the AMC itself may function as an antenna by feeding power to its patch directly. As a result, a small antenna whose performance is not degraded on metal was obtained.

Wearable Detector Device with Wireless Modular Neutron Detectors and Modular Gamma-Ray Detectors	2018 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS (NSS/MIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC) / 25th International Symposium on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	NOV 10-17, 2018	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE			SEMICONDUCTOR	Sixteen Modular Neutron Detectors (MNDs) and two Modular Gamma-Ray Detectors (MGDs) were integrated into a Wearable Detector Device (WDD) for covert or overt operations regarding nuclear non-proliferation search and localization of Special Nuclear Material (SNM). Each MND contains an array of 24, 1-cm(2) active-area Microstructured Semiconductor Neutron Detectors (MSNDs) with intrinsic thermal-neutron detection efficiencies of approximately 30%. All necessary signal processing, communications, and power conditioning electronics are also housed within the MND, which measures 1.2 cm x 6.1 cm x 1.7 cm (4.4 in. x 2.4 in. x 0.65 in.). The battery within the MND allows for approximately three weeks of continuous operation on a single charge. The MGD comprises seven LND model 713 Geiger-Muller detectors, an on-board battery, and all necessary signal processing, communications, and power conditioning electronics. Each detector module interfaces with a handheld Android device through Bluetooth Low Energy communications. When the number of counts reported by the MNDs is greater than the background neutron environment, the Android device will alarm to alert the operator to the possible presence of neutron-emitting SNM. The reported count rate from the MGDs can then be used as secondary confirmation of SNM, because SNMs that emit neutrons also emit gamma rays. The neutron response of the WDD for bare Cf-252 with fluxes of 0.1, 1, and 10 n cm(-2) s(-1) measured at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was 1.34 +/- 0.02, 9.93 +/- 0.01, and 99.65 +/- 0.01 cps, respectively. The corresponding neutron background count rate was 0.36 +/- 0.02 cps, significantly lower than any of the foreground count rates. When the Cf-252 source was placed in 4-cm thick, spherical HDPE moderator cask, the recorded count rate increased to 200.2 +/- 0.5 cps for 10 n cm(-2) s(-1) flux. The Gamma Absolute Rejection Ratio for neutrons (GARRn) for the WDD was measured at PNNL and was determined to be 1.02 for a neutron flux of 10 n cm(-2) s(-1) and 60(Co) gamma-ray exposure field of 10 mR/h indicating excellent gammaray rejection for the neutron detector modules. The PNNL measurement results compared well to measurements repeated at Kansas State University.	[Ochs, T. R.; Fronk, R. G.; Hutchins, R. M.; McGregor, D.

The typical elements within the house that can be controlled are: lighting, windows and shutters, doors, speakers, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, appliances (refrigerator, washing machine, ovens, etc.), audio-video systems, burglar alarms and fire alarms, telecommunications. Many operational control sequences can be automated to prevent the user from making the effort to adapt to systems. Some of these services will be provided by devices inside the home and others by external providers. So a great improvement to this control can happen by adding a certain degree of "intelligence" to the system allowing it to recognize recurring activities, dangerous or unusual situations in order to anticipate health problems or special needs of users within of the House. These problems can be addressed by monitoring the activities of regular users, which allows the creation of rules-based profiles, in order to grasp and formalize their normal behavior. In order to realize Smart Home systems through IoT, the problem of localization within closed spaces remains constant: in fact, efficiency is put to the test by all those that are the vertical closures (opinions and fixtures) with which optimal transmission with the outside is possible. The Beacon technology was used to solve the indoor transmission. The Beacon is a device that through Bluetooth Low Energy technology, is able to transmit information to mobile devices with a certain range of action. In this paper, for the Beacons, different methods of localization in a closed environment are tested and demonstrated through a mapping of the signal in a room, has led to satisfactory results. The relationship between the used beacon and area covered by their own signal is also identified in a beacon every 5 square meters; this result allows us to have an idea of the costs of mapping a given environment and the invasion of the technology inside it. A further raised question of the relationship between used beacon and covered area was how and where to place the beacons inside the room; The less satisfactory result concerns the error, albeit low, detected in the pure localization (ie without the help of external information such as the initial position) in a closed environment.

A 2D array is also a versatile tool for various applications such as 3D imaging, high-intensity focused ultrasound, particle manipulation, and pattern generation. However, building a 2D system involves complicated technologies: fabricating a 2D transducer array, developing a pitch-matched ASIC, and interconnecting the transducer and the ASIC. Previously, we successfully demonstrated 2D capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays using various fabrication technologies. In this paper, we present a 2D ultrasonic transmit phased array based on a 32 x 32 CMUT array flip-chip bonded to a pitch-matched pulser ASIC for ultrasonic neuromodulation. The ASIC consists of 32x32 unipolar high-voltage (HV) pulsers, each of which occupies an area of 250 mu m x 250 mu m. The phase of each pulser output is individually programmable with a resolution of 1/f(C)/16, where f(C) is less than 10 MHz. This enables the fine granular control of a focus. The ASIC was fabricated in the TSMC 0.18-mu m HV BCD process within an area of 9.8 mm x 9.8 mm, followed by a wafer-level solder bumping process. After flip-chip bonding an ASIC and a CMUT array, we identified shorted elements in the CMUT array using the built-in test function in the ASIC, which took approximately 9 minutes to scan the entire 32 x 32 array. A compact-form-factor wireless neural stimulator system-only requiring a connected 15-VDCpower supply-was also developed, integrating a power management unit, a clock generator, and a Bluetooth Low-Energy enabled microcontroller. The focusing and steering capability of the system in a 3D space is demonstrated, while achieving a spatial-peak pulse-average intensity (ISPPA) of 12.4 and 33.1 W/cm(2); and a 3-dB focal volume of 0.2 and 0.05 mm(3)-at a depth of 5 mm-at 2 and 3.4 MHz, respectively. We also characterized transmission of ultrasound through a mouse skull and compensated the phase distortion due to the skull by using the programmable phase-delay function in the ASIC, achieving 10% improvement in pressure and a tighter focus. Finally, we demonstrated a ultrasonic arbitrary pattern generation on a 5 mm x 5 mm plane at a depth of 5 mm.

Development of a Wearable Cardiac Monitoring System for Behavioral Neurocardiac Training: A Usability Study	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						mobile health; smartphones; sensor devices and platforms; wireless technology; mobile applications; electrocardiography; biofeedback, psychology; blood pressure; stress, physiological; relaxation	NETWORKS	Background: Elevated blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for death globally. Behavioral neurocardiac training (BNT) is a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management that is intended to exercise the autonomic reflexes, improve stress recovery, and lower blood pressure. BNT involves cognitive-behavioral therapy with a paced breathing technique and heart rate variability biofeedback. BNT is limited to in-clinic delivery and faces an accessibility barrier because of the need for clinical oversight and the use of complex monitoring tools. Objective: The objective of this project was to design, develop, and evaluate a wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensor system for the delivery of BNT in a home setting. Methods: The wearable sensor system, Beat, consists of an ECG sensor and a mobile app. It was developed iteratively using the principles of test-driven Agile development and user-centered design. A usability study was conducted at Toronto General Hospital to evaluate feasibility and user experience and identify areas of improvement. Results: The Beat sensor was designed as a modular patch to be worn on the user's chest and uses standard ECG electrodes. It streams a single-lead ECG wirelessly to a mobile phone using Bluetooth Low Energy. The use of small, low-power electronics, a low device profile, and a tapered enclosure allowed for a device that can be unobtrusively worn under clothing. The sensor was designed to operate with a mobile app that guides users through the BNT exercises to train them to a slow-paced breathing technique for stress recovery. The BNT app uses the ECG captured by the sensor to provide heart rate variability biofeedback in the form of a real-time heart rate waveform to complement and reinforce the impact of the training. Usability testing (n=6) indicated that the overall response to the design and user experience of the system was perceived positively. All participants indicated that the system had a positive effect on stress management and that they would use it at home. Areas of improvement were identified, which focused primarily on the delivery of training and education on BNT through the app. Conclusions: The outcome of this project was a wearable sensor system to deliver BNT at home. The system has the potential to offer a complementary approach to blood pressure and stress management at home and reduce current accessibility barriers.

Methods The Circadiem cross-sectional study aimed at determining early warning signals of risk of health alteration in hospital nightshifters (NS) versus dayshifters (DS, alternating morning and afternoon shifts). Circadian rhythmicity in activity, sleep, and temperature was telemonitored on work and free days for one week. Participants wore a bluetooth low energy thoracic accelerometry and temperature sensor that was wirelessly connected to a GPRS gateway and a health data hub server. Hidden Markov modelling of activity quantified Rhythm Index, rest quality (probability, p1-1, of remaining at rest), and rest duration. Spectral analyses determined periods in body surface temperature and accelerometry. Parameters were compared and predictors of circadian and sleep disruption were identified by multivariate analyses using information criteria-based model selection. Clusters of individual shift work response profiles were recognized. Findings Of 140 per-protocol participants (133 females), there were 63 NS and 77 DS. Both groups had similar median rest amount, yet NS had significantly worse median rest-activity Rhythm Index (0.38 [IQR, 0.29-0.47] vs. 0.69 [0.60-0.77], p<0.0001) and rest quality p1-1 (0.94 [0.94-0.95] vs 0.96 [0.94-0.97], p<0.0001) over the whole study week. Only 48% of the NS displayed a circadian period in temperature, as compared to 70% of the DS (p=0.026). Poor p1-1 was associated with nightshift work on both work (p<0.0001) and free days (p=0.0098). The number of years of past night work exposure predicted poor rest-activity Rhythm Index jointly with shift type, age and chronotype on workdays (p= 0.0074), and singly on free days (p=0.0005). Interpretation A dedicated analysis toolbox of streamed data from a wearable device identified circadian and sleep rhythm markers, that constitute surrogate candidate endpoints of poor health risk in shift-workers.

J	Sciullo, L; Trotta, A; Di Felice, M				Sciullo, Luca; Trotta, Angelo; Di Felice, Marco			Design and performance evaluation of a LoRa-based mobile emergency management system (LOCATE)	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); Lora technology; Emergency communication system (ECS); Data dissemination protocols; Performance evaluation	AD-HOC; SENSOR NETWORK; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTIVITY; TAXONOMY	Smartphone devices can play a key role on emergency scenarios thanks to their pervasiveness, and the possibility to convey emergency requests from the involved people to the rescue teams. At the same time, the effective utilization of such devices on critical scenarios with limited mobile Internet access is challenging. As an alternative, several recent research studies have proposed Emergency Communication System (ECS) based on short-range Device-to-Device (D2D) solutions available on Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) devices (e.g. Wi-Fi Direct); however, the target of these solutions is constituted by small indoor areas, since the scalability on large-scale environments is often a problem. In this paper, we overcome such issue by proposing LOCATE, a novel phone-based ECS enabling long-range communication among survivors and rescue teams over critical environments where 3/4G cellular connectivity is not available and the traditional geo-localization technologies (e.g. the GPS) provide only partial coverage of the environment. The proposed system consists of a mobile application connected to a LoRa transceiver via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); through the app, users can send emergency requests that are re-broadcasted by other peers until reaching a rescue personnel who is able to handle the emergency. Three novel contributions are provided in this paper. First, we provide extensive measurements of the LoRa technology, and investigate its suitability for ECS-related applications. Second, we describe the LOCATE prototype and the enabling algorithms; specifically, we propose a novel multi-hop dissemination algorithm which maximizes the probability to deliver an emergency request to the destination (e.g. rescue personnel) within a user-defined temporal threshold, while minimizing the number of message re-transmissions. Third, we extensively evaluate the LOCATE performance through OMNeT++ simulations, assessing the capability of the dissemination protocol to spread out the emergency requests over large-scale scenarios, and through experiments, assessing the capability of LoRa-based trilateration technique to provide accurate GPS-free localization. The results demonstrate that the LOCATE protocol is able to minimize the time required to handle the emergency when compared to other dissemination strategies (e.g. flooding, continuous, onceper-contact), and they highlight the considerable improvement provided by the LoRa technology over other D2D solutions available on COTS smartphones (e.g. Wi-Fi Direct).

We set-up an appropriate IT-architecture for easier transportation of obtained measurement data and prepared a web-based GUI along with appropriate robust and precise miniature electronic PCB boards that can be easily adopted and used for monitoring and/or control applications in plastics processing industry. As polymer materials are not good thermal conductors, the elimination of large quantities of heat needed to solidify a part also creates major problems if rapid production needs to be maintained. Therefore, a proper IoT measurement system needs to be established that is capable to precisely measure the temperature and cavity pressure behavior during different processing stages. Furthermore, a specially constructed prototype mold was selected for testing purposes which has two cavities that are used for testing shrinkage behavior of various thermoplastic materials. The measurement results practically confirmed that the developed measurement device system fulfils the requirements for precise and robust wireless IoT based measurements of temperatures on cylinders, molds and tempering units, and cavity pressures inside the prototype mold according to Industry 4.0 requirements.
