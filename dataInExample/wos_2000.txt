This article proposes a novel 3-D indoor localization algorithm which uses the combination of BLE and multiple sensors (3D-LBMS). The inertial navigation system (INS) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) mechanizations are combined for accurate heading and speed estimation, which contains a multilevel constraints-based quasistatic magnetic field (QSMF) detection algorithm. In addition, dynamic-time-warping (DTW)-based BLE landmark detection algorithm is proposed to provide absolute 3-D location reference to multiple sensors-based positioning method, and the detected BLE landmark points are also used to calibrate the parameter of step-length calculation. Finally, the adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) is applied to fuse the results of INS/PDR mechanizations, QSMF and locations of detected BLE landmarks to achieve accurate and concrete multisource-based 3-D indoor localization performance. The experimental results show that the proposed 3-D-LBMS is proved to achieve meterlevel 2-D positioning accuracy and submeter level 3-D altitude estimation accuracy in typical indoor environments.

The real time simulator is a simulation using the data collected in real time, which is effective in reduce prediction error and support quick decision making. However, due to a high analytical cost in the conventional work measurement, it is difficult to continuously collect the worker's behavior data of the cellular manufacturing system in real time. For this purpose, first we built an experimental cellular manufacturing line that is able to collect the workers' behavior data in real time using the Bluetooth low energy beacons and acceleration sensors. Thereby, we constructed a real time simulation to combine the analyzed behavior data and a discrete event simulation. The result revealed that, the relative error between our method and the video observation method is small, and the prediction error of our simulation is smaller than using the standard work time.

Usually an assigned employee records manually the temperatures of the hospital cold storages such as refrigerators and freezers that keep them at regular intervals. In this research, a low power wireless Bluetooth Low Energy network is applied where the central monitoring personal computer, receives the temperature data and stores in a database. The system consists of many beacons which are wirelessly sending the measured temperature data, and the central monitoring computer which allows the user to monitor that data. In the case of wireless signals getting blocked due to obstacles, repeaters called bridges send the data to the central computer forming a so-called scatter net. Once the data is received by the Bluetooth module connected to the monitoring computer, an application saves the data into a database. This web application forms a website where the users holding the authentication information can log in and monitor the temperature data in the form of tables and graphs. The same information can be viewed by a smartphone and a person in charge receives a warning SMS message. This system also provides a scheduled backup system where the database is automatically backed up periodically. The suggested system has the advantage of managing reagent records with reduced manpower whilst coping for emergency situations automatically.

The solution to this problem is to carry a shopping list. In this project, a novel Internet of Things (IoT)-connected smart canister system is developed, which automatically senses the item quantity in the canisters using proximity sensor, sends the data to a hub using Bluetooth Low Energy, and then the hub sends a cloud message to the consumer's smartphone app using the Internet. The hub and the smartphone app display the item quantities and automatically add the items that are about to finish to a digital shopping list. The automatic generation of the shopping list removes the burden of manually checking each item before going to the shops and gives peace of mind to the consumers. A prototype of the proposed system with three canister devices, one hub, and the smartphone app is developed and tested successfully. The canister device consumes ultra-low power and has a battery life of more than a year.

Currently, low power technologies based on radio frequency (RF) spectrum (e.g., Bluetooth low energy) are significantly used in healthcare. However, its spectrum is strictly regulated and its effect on human health is also a matter of concern. Optical camera communication (OCC) is emerged as a promising technology which can be utilized in eHealth as a complementary to RF. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid OCC/RF architecture for remote health monitoring of patients. The health information will be transmitted in real-time from the body sensors to the eHealth gateway using the hybrid infrastructure. An access point selection algorithm is proposed which will be exploited on the basis of position of camera and LED patch mounted with the body sensors. Furthermore, at the end of this paper, simulation results are presented which demonstrate the performance and feasibility of the proposed scheme.	[Hasan, Moh.

And basic things like a walk to the museum will change daily life through new technological progress. An indoor tracking device for increasing user engagement in a museum is discussed in this article. IoT can be used to collect and analyze data provided by visitors, which leads to data-driven insights that power museum experience that is fresh, adaptive, and engaging. It uses an IoT implementation, a sensor network located in a museum's physical space, to see how people access the various rooms of a curated exposition and spend their time in them. Many cultural organizations serve both entertainment and educational purposes, including major museums. A museum's traditional function is to collect culturally important objects and materials of cultural and historical significance to preserve and educate the public about these different objects. This article proposes an IoT-constructed architecture for interactive experience design (IoT-IED), with the most recent developments in ICT, to enhance the user's cultural experience. The critical components of the proposed architecture are a Bluetooth Low Energy indoor localization service capable of capturing and processing username files. Helpful in showing personalized cultural content and sharing multimedia data in the cloud with an intelligent computer and processing center that manages the center of the whole business logic. Furthermore, the applications incorporate a primary Kalman filter in a smartphone without needing the cloud to enhance location, accuracy, and reliability. It works mainly with wearable and mobile devices and connects with the outside world to collect cloud information and deliver services to external users. The experimental results shows the IoT-IED has been evaluated using simulation analysis, which improves the prediction accuracy 96.7% and precision 98.3% compared to an existing model.

As a result, a multitude of techniques has been proposed to localize objects and devices in indoor environments. Wireless fingerprinting, which leverages machine learning, has emerged as one of the most popular positioning approaches due to its low implementation cost. The prevailing fingerprinting-based positioning mainly utilizes wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signals. However, the RSS of Wi-Fi and BLE signals are very sensitive to the layout of the indoor environment. Thus, any change in the indoor layout could potentially lead to severe degradation in terms of localization performance. To foster the development of new positioning methods, several open-source location fingerprinting datasets have been made available to the research community. Unfortunately, none of these public datasets provides the received signal strength (RSS) measurements for indoor environments with different layouts. To fill this gap, this paper presents a new hybrid Wi-Fi and BLE fingerprinting dataset for multi-floor indoor environments with different layouts to facilitate the future development of new fingerprinting-based positioning systems that can provide adaptive positioning performance in dynamic indoor environments. Additionally, the effects of indoor layout change on the location fingerprint and localization performance are also investigated.

Addition of cloud connectivity to patient monitoring systems has enabled logging and remote monitoring of patient status in a continuous manner. Automation of measurement and supervision of tasks not only reduces workload on the nursing staff but also helps in reducing human errors in measurement. Urine output, one of the critical parameters of the human body, continues to be measured by a process that is labour intensive. In this paper, we present a device for measurement of urine output in the critical care unit of a hospital. The device is powered by an ARM Cortex MO processor and communicates wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy. The device automates the process of continuous measurement of urine output by using a load cell that measures the weight of the urine bag to calculate the urine output. The measured values are sent to an Android application which pushes the received data onto a web-based cloud storage application for remote monitoring.	[Raam, Ganesh K.; Jeelani, Ahamed; Preejith, S.

In this paper, we propose a low-cost system for low-accuracy cow localization based on the reception of signals sent by an acceleration measurement system using the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The system consists of low-cost tags and receiving stations. The tag specifications and the localization accuracy of the system were studied experimentally. The received signal strength propagation model and dependence on the tag orientation was studied in an open-space and a barn environment. Two experiments for the evaluation of localization accuracy were conducted with 35 and 19 cows for two days. The localization reference was achieved from feeding stations, a milking robot and videos of cows decoded manually. The localization accuracy (mean +/- standard deviation) was 3.27 +/- 2.11 m for the entire barn (10 x 40 m(2)) and 1.9 +/- 0.67 m for a smaller area (4 x 5 m(2)). The system can be used for recognizing long-distance walking, crowded areas in the barn, e.g., queues to milking robots, and cow's preferable locations. The estimated system cost was 500 + 20 x (cow number) euro for one barn. The system has open-access software and detailed instructions for its installation and usage.

Research on fusion-based indoor localization using WiFi and Bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) beacons has mostly been limited to training-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a training-free indoor localization technique using received signals from WiFi and BLE device. The proposed technique estimates the position of the user device by fusing the information that it gains regarding the position of the target from the WiFi channel state information (CSI) and the RSSI measurements of BLE beacons. We use the WiFi CSI to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA), which we then use in conjunction with the RSSI measurements from the BLE beacons to develop a multi-radio fusion framework for indoor localization. We use a weighted centroid localization method to obtain an initial position estimate from the RSSI measurements. The initial position estimation helps to resolve the ambiguities in the AoA. The proposed technique is based on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) exploiting the probability density functions of the estimated AoA and the RSSI-induced distances. Simulation results show that the proposed technique improves the localization accuracy by 30% in a typical indoor environment compared with previous approaches.

While years of low-power wireless research now allows developers to fully optimize the performance of applications built on top of IEEE 802.15.4, this has not yet happened with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), whose networking performance is still largely unexplored and whose potential is not yet fully exploited. Indeed, BLE radios are often treated as a black box, because they are meant to only execute data transfer commands and manufacturers build BLE soft devices with closed source network stacks. As a result, developers working with BLE cannot modify the radio driver or the link-layer, and hence have no direct control over radio duty cycling and packet re-transmissions. To tackle these challenges, we analyze and model how specific BLE features can be used to fine-tune communication performance at run-time. We further present the design and implementation of BLEach, an IPv6-over-BLE stack that exposes tuning knobs for controlling the energy usage and timeliness of BLE transmissions and that allows to enforce a variety of quality-of-service (QoS) metrics. We design three exemplary modules for BLEach providing novel BLE functionality: adaptive radio duty cycling, IPv6-over-BLE traffic prioritization and multiplexing, as well as indirect link-quality monitoring. We integrate BLEach into Contiki and release its code, thus addressing the lack of a full-fledged open-source IPv6-over-BLE stack. Experiments demonstrate that BLEach is lightweight, interoperable with other standard-compliant devices, and reduces energy costs by up to 50 % while giving QoS guarantees by quickly adapting to changes in interference, traffic priority, and traffic load.

This device is digitally controlled with a BLE-incorporated micro-controller characterized by its small size and low power consumption, providing long-life battery. The proposed system consists of two main parts: first, the BLE moisture device including the moisture content measurement and wireless capability (BLE); second, the cloud-based monitoring platform, providing remote visualization and control for all the sensor nodes of the network. The complete infrastructure shows how multiple nodes can read and transmit moisture content of timber in buildings using small and unattended devices, with data saved in a central database and monitored by multiple commercial devices such as PC, smartphone, tablet, etc. The proposed system is innovative, scalable and low cost, and it can be deployed in wooden buildings and the wood industry, providing a practical solution that will help to avoid rot and other damaging effects caused by the moisture content.

ADPLL is one of the attractive solutions due to its low design complexity and low power consumption which makes it suitable candidate for low power IoT devices. The RI based design eliminates the strict requirements of time to digital converter (TDC) in traditional ADPLL structure which significantly reduces the design complexity and consumes low power. By utilizing the efficient system design capabilities offered by the LabVIEW environment, a RI based ADPLL is modeled in LabVIEW to evaluate the design and analyze its performance. The system level simulation of the ADPLL is significantly meaningful for the research and design process in a comprehensive way. The simulation results are also presented for the 2.4 GHz reference injection based ADPLL from a reference frequency of 32MHz.

Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, data communications between the drones and the ground devices are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This article develops BloothAir, which is a secure multi-hop aerial relay system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connected autonomous drones. For encrypting the BLE communications in BloothAir, a channel-based secret key generation is proposed, where received signal strength at the drones and the ground devices is quantized to generate the secret keys. Moreover, a dynamic programming-based channel quantization scheme is studied to minimize the secret key bit mismatch rate of the drones and the ground devices by recursively adjusting the quantization intervals. To validate the design of BloothAir, we build a multi-hop aerial relay testbed by using the MX400 drone platform and the Gust radio transceiver, which is a new lightweight onboard BLE communicator specially developed for the drone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that the BloothAir system achieves a significantly lower secret key bit mismatch rate than the key generation benchmarks, which use the static quantization intervals. In addition, the high randomness of the generated secret keys is verified by the standard NIST test, thereby effectively protecting the BLE communications in BloothAir from the eavesdropping attacks.

To efficiently monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and the levels of pollutants, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air, and to collect data covering vast geographical areas, the development of cheap energy-autonomous sensors for large scale deployment and fine-grained data acquisition is required. Rapid advances in electronics and communication technologies along with the emergence of paradigms such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have led to the development of low-cost sensor devices that can operate unattended for long periods of time and communicate using wired or wireless connections through the Internet. We investigate the energy efficiency of an environmental monitoring system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons that operate in the IoT environment. The beacons developed measure the temperature, the relative humidity, the light intensity, and the CO2 and VOC levels in the air. Based on our analysis we have developed efficient sleep scheduling algorithms that allow the sensor nodes developed to operate autonomously without requiring the replacement of the power supply. The experimental results show that low-power sensors communicating using BLE technology can operate autonomously (from the energy perspective) in applications that monitor the environment or the air quality in indoor or outdoor settings.

The typical SDMA scheme requires estimations of channel state information (CSI) using orthogonal pilot sequences. However, the orthogonal pilot is not embedded in the BLE packet. This fact motivates us to add ICA detector into BLE systems. In this paper, focusing on the covariance matrix of ICA outputs, SIC can be applied with Cholesky decomposition. Then, in order to address the phase ambiguity problems created by the ICA process, we propose a differential detection scheme based on the MAP algorithm. In practical scenarios, it is subject to carrier frequency offset (CFO) as well as symbol timing offset (STO) induced by the hardware impairments present in the BLE peripherals. The packet error rate (PER) performance is evaluated by computer simulations when BLE peripherals simultaneously communicate in the presence of CFO and STO.

In [12], it has been shown that by detecting and analyzing the current pattern, a class of time synchronization schemes can be devised. In this paper, we study the accuracy of one of the methods of this class in several conditions which can affect the accuracy of the current consumption pattern such as device dependency, transmit power, and temperature. Extensive analysis with several BLE devices and various parameter combinations has been done by experimental measurements.

Compressing data can thus be seen as a nice feature that could allow both longer battery life and more simultaneous channels at the same time. A lot of research has been done in lossy compression algorithms for EMG data, but being lossy, artifacts are inevitably introduced in the signal. Some artifacts can usually be tolerable for current applications. Nevertheless, for some research purposes and to enable future research on the collected data, that might need to exploit various and currently unforseen features that had been discarded by lossy algorithms, lossless compression of data may be very important, as it guarantees no extra artifacts are introduced on the digitized signal. The present paper aims at demonstrating the effectiveness of such approaches, investigating the performance of several algorithms and their implementation on a real EMG BLE wireless sensor node. It is demonstrated that the required bandwidth can be more than halved, even reduced to 1/4 on an average case, and if the complexity of the compressor is kept low, it also ensures significant power savings.

The coordinates in indoor positioning are calculated from the radio signal strength, although distance errors occur between the measured and calculated positions. This paper proposes the method for selecting BLE beacons in multi-point positioning for distance error reduction. The proposed method consists of Learning and Calculation Phase. The correct values used in the proposed method are the values measured with the tape measure. The Learning Phase obtains features from the RSSI distribution of each beacon and uses them to compute the coordinates in the Calculation Phase. The Calculation Phase is used for navigation with an allowable distance error of 0.5 [m] based on a person's shoulder width. The proposed method calculates the typical value from the Learning Phase based on the probability that it fits within the distance error range of 0.5 [m]. The calculated position uses the logarithmic approximation to convert the beacon's radio signal strength to the distance. The experiment for measuring the distance error compares the proposed method calculated, the existing method calculated by two-dimensional three-point positioning, and the tape measure-based method. The number of combinations in three-point positioning was also changed to compare the accuracy. The mean distance error compared to the value measured with a tape measure was 1.337 [m] for the existing method and 0.449 [m] for the proposed method. The proposed method is 66.3% less distance error than the existing methods.

Application-Layer Time Synchronization and Data Alignment Method for Multichannel Biosignal Sensors Using BLE Protocol	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE); biosensor; time synchronization; wireless sensor network; Internet of things (IoT)	NETWORKS; ECG	Wearable wireless biomedical sensors have emerged as a rapidly growing research field. For many biomedical signals, multiple sensors distributed about the body without local wired connections are required. However, designing multisite systems at low cost with low latency and high precision time synchronization of acquired data is an unsolved problem. Current solutions use custom wireless protocols or extra hardware for synchronization, forming custom systems with high power consumption that prohibit migration between commercial microcontrollers. We aimed to develop a better solution. We successfully developed a low-latency, Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based data alignment method, implemented in the BLE application layer, making it transferable between manufacturer devices. The time synchronization method was tested on two commercial BLE platforms by inputting common sinusoidal input signals (over a range of frequencies) to evaluate time alignment performance between two independent peripheral nodes. Our best time synchronization and data alignment method achieved absolute time differences of 69 +/- 71 mu s for a Texas Instruments (TI) platform and 477 +/- 490 mu s for a Nordic platform. Their 95th percentile absolute errors were more comparable-under 1.8 ms for each. Our method is transferable between commercial microcontrollers and is sufficient for many biomedical applications.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) extends the capabilities of smartphones even further and thus provides the potential for retailers to offer services to customers based on their location that is challenging with conventional techniques. Before embarking on developing solutions, it is vital to understand the factors that influence consumers to embrace this technology and ensure retailers can offer appropriate services to their customers. While a number of studies have discussed BLE, very little have examined it from the consumers' perspective. This study extends the UTAUT2 model with 'privacy concern' and explores the factors influencing consumers' behaviour towards proximity sensors within a retail store. The results confirm that all the factors except for 'price value' are statistically significant.

By embracing the IoT evolution, there has been a surge of recent interest in localization/tracking within indoor environments based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The basic motive behind BLE-enabled IoT applications is to provide advanced residential and enterprise solutions in an energy efficient and reliable fashion. Although recently different state estimation (SE) methodologies, ranging from Kalman filters, Particle filters, to multiple-modal solutions, have been utilized for BLEbased indoor localization, there is a need for ever more accurate and real-time algorithms. The main challenge here is that multipath fading and drastic fluctuations in the indoor environment result in complex non-linear, non-Gaussian estimation problems. The paper focuses on an alternative solution to the existing filtering techniques and introduces/discusses incorporation of the Belief Condensation Filter (BCF) for localization via BLE-enabled beacons. The BCF is a member of the universal approximation family of densities with performance bound achieving accuracy and efficiency in sequential SE and Bayesian tracking. It is a resilient filter in harsh environments where nonlinearities and non-Gaussian noise profiles persist, as seen in such applications as Indoor Localization.

This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model to classify 4G LTE downlink, 4G LTE uplink, 5G NR downlink, 5G NR uplink, IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0 signals. The classifier operates on In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples and does not require synchronization with the unknown signals. To improve the generalizability of the classifier, comprehensive signal datasets are generated to include a wide range of signal configurations found in the standards. These signals are impaired with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh or Ricean multipath fading channels, frequency offsets, and I/Q imbalances to make the signals more realistic. The exploration of time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain features reveals high frequency resolution time-frequency domain features perform best. The proposed CNN model achieves a high classification accuracy in the presence of all of the aforementioned impairments, achieving over 94% accuracy for signal to noise ratios (SNR) greater than 0 dB.

Some zero-effort authentication techniques (e.g., Sound-Proof) have been proposed to relieve such burdens without degrading security, but are vulnerable to prediction attacks and co-existence attacks. This paper proposes ABLE, a zero-effort 2FA approach based on co-location detection leveraging environmental Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal characteristics. In this approach, a laptop on which the user tries to authenticate to a web server, and the user's smartphone placed nearby which is trusted by the server, both collect and send a record of environmental BLE signal characteristics to the server. The server decides whether the two devices are co-located by evaluating the similarity of the two records, and makes the authentication decision. ABLE is constructed based on the fact that only two devices in close proximity share similar environmental signal characteristics, which distinguishes a legitimate user device from potential adversaries. Due to its location-sensitive nature, combining favorable features brought with the BLE protocol, ABLE is gifted with good resistance to attacks that threaten existing zero-effort authentication schemes. ABLE is not only immune to remote attackers, but also achieves an accuracy over 90% even against co-present attackers.

However, especially critical is the energy efficiency in the context of wearable and body-area network devices. At the very same time, due to their nature, these use cases often impose stringent latency and reliability requirements. In this study, we provide an insight into the feasibility and the performance of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0 compatible sensor devices enriched with a wake-up radio (WUR). Introduction of a low-consuming WUR radio equips a sensing device with a mechanism to know when its data are desired, and helps to avoid the unnecessary data transmissions thus saving energy. To investigate the utility of this approach and the associated with it trade-offs, we start by instrumenting and measuring a real-life prototype of a WUR-equipped BLE device. Based on the results of the real-life measurements, we first develop the analytical models, and then analyze how the latency requirements imposed by the application and the number of the wake-up signals affect the energy consumption of the WUR-equipped BLE device and a standalone BLE sensor. Our results show under which conditions each of these architectures outperforms another one and demonstrate that the WUR approach can be more energy efficient in the case if the desired latency for data delivery is below 2.11 s.

The proposed quadrature RF-to-baseband-current-reuse RF front-end consists of a low-noise transconductance amplifier, an active-type polyphase filter-based quadrature generator, transimpedance amplifiers, and double-balanced current-mode passive mixers on a single dc current path. An input matching network is used to perform power-constrained simultaneous noise and input power matching and 1/f noise reduction in the RF and baseband domains, respectively. The quadrature RF signals are provided to the single-quadrature mixers through an embedded active-type polyphase filter-based quadrature generator. The implemented Bluetooth low energy receiver is composed of the RF-to-baseband-current-reuse RF front-end, IF amplifiers, two-stage passive-RC polyphase filter, and fifth-order Chebyshev-II G(m)-C filters. The proposed design was fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS process and characterized primarily in the Bluetooth low energy operating frequency bands.

J	Darroudi, SM; Gomez, C				Mahdi Darroudi, Seyed; Gomez, Carles			Experimental Evaluation of 6BLEMesh: IPv6-Based BLE Mesh Networks	SENSORS			English	Article						bluetooth low energy; BLE; mesh; 6LoWPAN; 6Lo; experimental evaluation; energy modeling; internet of things; IoT		Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become a major wireless technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). Recent efforts of academia, industry and standards development organizations have focused on creating BLE mesh network solutions. 6BLEMesh is a specification being developed by the IETF that defines an IPv6-oriented approach for BLE mesh networking. In this paper, we perform an experimental evaluation of 6BLEMesh, based on a real implementation. We evaluate latency, round trip time (RTT) and energy consumption. For the latter, we model the device current consumption, we determine the energy efficiency of communication, and we obtain the theoretical device lifetime (for battery-operated devices), for three different hardware platforms. Under the assumptions in our study (including a simple 235 mAh battery, and periodic data transmission), the maximum, asymptotic, device lifetime is 573 days, whereas battery-operated router devices can also achieve 3-digit lifetimes (in days) in many scenarios. Our results also illustrate the impact on performance of BLE-level and application-level parameter settings, adaptation layer mechanisms such as IPv6 header compression, and device hardware characteristics.

In a typical IoT scenario, an IoT device first needs to be connected with its companion mobile app which serves as a gateway for its Internet access. To establish a connection, a device first broadcasts advertisement packets with UUIDs to nearby smartphone apps. Leveraging these UUIDs, a companion app is able to identify the device, pairs and bonds with it, and allows further data communication. However, we show that there is a fundamental flaw in the current design and implementation of the communication protocols between a BLE device and its companion mobile app, which allows an attacker to precisely fingerprint a BLE device with static UUIDs from the apps. Meanwhile, we also discover that many BLE IoT devices adopt "Just Works" pairing, allowing attackers to actively connect with these devices if there is no app-level authentication. Even worse, this vulnerability can also be directly uncovered from mobile apps. Furthermore, we also identify that there is an alarming number of vulnerable app-level authentication apps, which means the devices connected by these apps can be directly controlled by attackers. To raise the public awareness of BLE IoT device fingerprinting and also uncover these vulnerable BLE IoT devices before attackers, we develop an automated mobile app analysis tool BLESCOPE and evaluate it with all of the free BLE IoT apps in Google Play store. Our tool has identified 1,757 vulnerable mobile apps in total. We also performed a field test in a 1.28 square miles region, and identified 5, 822 real BLE devices, among them 5, 509 (94.6%) are fingerprintable by attackers, and 431 (7.4%) are vulnerable to unauthorized access. We have made responsible disclosures to the corresponding app developers, and also reported the fingerprinting issues to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.

Providing a space maintained QoL, i. e., maintaining the indoor comfort in a house is one of the main components of smart space. This study provides indoor comfort with a networked lighting system. The proposed system has two main functions: (1) controlling full color OLED lights via Wi-Fi, and (2) collecting data related to the environment as well as people's entries and exits for evaluation of the system to determine whether the system helps in providing comfort and is used by people who do not use the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Function (1) provides for automatic operation and control of full color changing OLED lights via WiFi. Function (2) measures, collects, and stores the data almost at real-time and utilizes them for the evaluation of the system itself in order to maintain indoor comfort by the networked lights. To test the effectiveness of the system, it was installed at a day-care center in northern Japan for six months. According to the results, the proposed system showed 100% operation checking rate 210 times, and the evaluation functions showed the rate of indoor comfort, indicated as Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values. Human detection around the system, detected by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), could also be seen.

This paper presents a multifunctional, battery-free tag combining Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology powered by the far-field wireless power transmission technique. The proposed tag, with a size of 9 x 8 cm(2), can be used for asset tracking via UWB at a center frequency of 4 GHz or for wireless temperature and humidity monitoring via BLE at 2.45 GHz. The tag is powered by a highly efficient radiofrequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) solution at 868 MHz. The proposed solution has been optimised for low power consumption of 5-15 mu J (for a single UWB transmission) and can provide reliable performance in terms of data sensing and geolocation at a low ambient power density. The electronic module that includes the features of the energy harvester (rectifier) and the UWB transceiver was previously developed by Uwinloc. Simulation results for both antennas (UWB and RF EH) were presented. The transmission rate in BLE and UWB configuration was also evaluated as a function of the EIRP power level.

The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have long been employed for LBS to navigate and determine accurate and reliable location information in outdoor environments. However, the GNSS signals are too weak to penetrate buildings and unable to provide reliable indoor LBS. Hence, GNSS's incompetence in the indoor environment invites extensive research and development of an indoor positioning system (IPS). Various technologies and techniques have been studied for IPS development. This paper provides an overview of the available smartphone-based indoor localization solutions that rely on radio frequency technologies. As fingerprinting localization is mostly accepted for IPS development owing to its good localization accuracy, we discuss fingerprinting localization in detail. In particular, our analysis is more focused on practical IPS that are realized using a smartphone and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a signal source. Furthermore, we elaborate on the challenges of practical IPS, the available solutions and comprehensive performance comparison, and present some future trends in IPS development.

The proposed system is assumed to be used in disaster situation where the Internet connection is not available. It means that a smartphone cannot obtain any information as well as any new application because all the applications are distributed in the cloud such as App Store. However, our proposed system is equipped with the mechanism, called RecurShare, to distribute the applications on-site. In addition, our proposed system has the function to solve "Central-Peripheral problem" which stems from BLE hardware. Generally, a smartphone works as "Central" of BLE connection, and the connection between Centrals cannot be established. Therefore, it is not easy to realize a BLE-based ad-hoc communication system between smartphones except iPhone. Our proposed function utilizes a few peripheral-ready terminal as a router of the network for solving this problem. To evaluate the feasibility of our proposed system, we show that the proposed system can replicate the application on-site and also enable chat among Android smartphones even if some of them are Central-only terminal.

In particular, movements of persons need to be monitored or driven for avoiding gathering of people, especially in small environments. In this paper, we present an efficient and cost-effective indoor navigation system for driving people inside large smart buildings. Our solution takes advantage of an emerging short-range wireless communication technology - IoT-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and exploits BLE Beacons across the environment to provide mobile users equipped with a smartphone hints on how to arrive at the destination. The main scientific contribution of our work is a new proximity-based navigation system that identifies the user position according to information sent by Beacons, processes the best path for indoor navigation at the edge computing infrastructure, and provides it to the user through the smartphone. We provide some experimental results to test the communication system considering both the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS).

The data collection of basic and health-related data of individuals in today's highly mobile society does help to plan, protect, and identify next steps health authorities and governments can, shall, or need to plan for or even implement. Thus, every individual, human, and inhabitant of the world is the key player - very different from many past crises'. And since all individuals are involved his/her (a) health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance, not overruling one aspect with another one. Privacy remains key. The solution of the current pandemic's data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic and can be achieved in a democratic and very open, but still and especially privacy-protecting manner. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application designed utilizes the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where public-key cryptography is being applied to allow for deciphering of messages for that destination it had been intended for.

The surround sound system generally requires multiple speakers fixed in specific positions and connected to dedicated audio jack holes. In this paper, we propose wireless speakers that can aware their locations and dedicated sound channels without troublesome installations. The proposed speakers use the Internet of things devices by combining a Raspberry Pi and a beacon to each speaker, which enable smart and connected applications. Each speaker estimates distances to other speakers from received signal strength indication of beacons with bluetooth low energy signals. By analyzing the relative distances between speakers, we detect the speaker locations in various speaker setups. We experimented our method with three sound system formats in various sizes and analyzed the accuracy of the location detection.

This system is used for monitoring temperature, heartbeat, blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and the acceleration of a human body in real-time. This system consists of a temperature sensor, a pulse oximeter sensor, an accelerometer sensor, a microcontroller unit, and a Bluetooth low energy module. Batteries are needed for supplying energy to this sensor system, but batteries have a limited lifetime. Therefore, a photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid energy harvester is developed to power a wearable medical sensor system. This harvester provides sufficient energy and increases the lifetime of the sensor system. The proposed hybrid energy harvester is composed of a flexible photovoltaic panel, a thermoelectric generator module, a DC-DC boost converter, and two super-capacitors. Experimentally, in active-sleep mode, the sensor system consumes an average power of 2.13 mW over 1 h and works without the energy harvester for 46 h. Finally, the experimental results illustrate the sustainable and long-term monitoring operation for the medical sensor system.

J	Huang, K; He, K; Du, XC				Huang, Ke; He, Ke; Du, Xuecheng			A Hybrid Method to Improve the BLE-Based Indoor Positioning in a Dense Bluetooth Environment	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor positioning; Bluetooth Low Energy; dense Bluetooth environment; trilateration; dead reckoning; Kalman filter		Indoor positioning using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons has attracted considerable attention after the release of the BLE protocol. A number of efforts have been exerted to improve the performance of BLE-based indoor positioning. However, few studies pay attention to the BLE-based indoor positioning in a dense Bluetooth environment, where the propagation of BLE signals become more complex and more fluctuant. In this paper, we draw attention to the problems resulting from the dense Bluetooth environment, and it turns out that the dense Bluetooth environment would result in a high received signal strength indication (RSSI) variation and a longtime interval collection of BLE. Hence, to mitigate the effects of the dense Bluetooth environment, we propose a hybrid method fusing sliding-window filtering, trilateration, dead reckoning and the Kalman filtering method to improve the performance of the BLE indoor positioning. The Kalman filter is exploited to merge the trilateration and dead reckoning. Extensive experiments in a real implementation are conducted to examine the performance of three approaches: trilateration, dead reckoning and the fusion method. The implementation results proved that the fusion method was the most effective method to improve the positioning accuracy and timeliness in a dense Bluetooth environment. The positioning root-mean-square error (RMSE) calculation results have showed that the hybrid method can achieve a real-time positioning and reduce error of indoor positioning.

Bluetooth-based RTLS systems are cost-effective but lack accuracy because Bluetooth signal is subject to significant fluctuation. We aim to improve the accuracy of RTLS using the deep learning technique. Methods We installed a Bluetooth sensor network in a three-floor clinic building to track patients, staff, and devices. The Bluetooth sensors measured the strength of the signal broadcasted from Bluetooth tags, which was fed into a deep neural network to calculate the location of the tags. The proposed deep neural network consists of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a deep classifier for tracking moving objects. Additionally, a spatial-temporal constraint algorithm was implemented to further increase the accuracy and stability of the results. To train the neural network, we divided the building into 115 zones and collected training data in each zone. We further augmented the training data to generate cross-zone trajectories, mimicking the real-world scenarios. We tuned the parameters for the proposed neural network to achieve relatively good accuracy. Results The proposed deep neural network achieved an overall accuracy of about 97% for tracking objects in each individual zone in the whole three-floor building, 1.5% higher than the baseline neural network that was proposed in an earlier paper, when using 10 s of signals. The accuracy increased with the density of Bluetooth sensors. For tracking moving objects, the proposed neural network achieved stable and accurate results. When latency is less of a concern, we eliminated the effect of latency from the accuracy and gained an accuracy of 100% for our testing trajectories, significantly improved from the baseline method. Conclusions The proposed deep neural network composed of a LSTM, a deep classifier and a posterior constraint algorithm significantly improved the accuracy and stability of RTLS for tracking moving objects.

When it comes to BLE-based dynamic indoor tracking, however, due to drastic fluctuations of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), highly acceptable accuracies are not yet achieved. Although very recent introduction of BLE v 5.1 promises prosperous future for BLE-based dynamic tracking, the following two key issues are in the path: (i) Despite of being in the age of big data with huge emphasis on reproducibility of research, there is no unified dataset with precise ground truth available for performing dynamic BLE-based tracking, and; (ii) The main focus of existing works are on utilization of stand-alone models. The paper addresses these gaps. At one hand, we introduce a reliable dataset, referred to as the IoT-TD, leveraging specific set of four optical cameras to provide ground truth with millimeter accuracies. The introduced IoT-TD dataset consists of RSSI values collected from five BLE sensors together with synchronized Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals from the target's mobile device. On the other hand, the paper introduces a multiple-model dynamic estimation framework coupling RSSI-based particle filtering with IMU-based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR). Experimental results based on the IoT-TD dataset corroborate effectiveness of multiple modeling fusion frameworks for providing enhanced BLE-based tracking accuracies.

Comparison between Two Time Synchronization and Data Alignment Methods for Multi-Channel Wearable Biosensor Systems Using BLE Protocol	SENSORS			English	Article						biosensor; BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy); biomedical signal; time synchronization; wireless sensor network	CLINICAL-CARDIOLOGY; ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY; STANDARDIZATION; RECOMMENDATIONS; COMMITTEE; COUNCIL; DESIGN	Wireless wearable sensor systems for biomedical signal acquisition have developed rapidly in recent years. Multiple sensors are often deployed for monitoring common bioelectric signals, such as EEG (electroencephalogram), ECG (electrocardiogram), and EMG (electromyogram). Compared with ZigBee and low-power Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can be a more suitable wireless protocol for such systems. However, current time synchronization methods for BLE multi-channel systems, via either BLE beacon transmissions or additional hardware, cannot satisfy the requirements of high throughput with low latency, transferability between commercial devices, and low energy consumption. We developed a time synchronization and simple data alignment (SDA) algorithm, which was implemented in the BLE application layer without the need for additional hardware. We further developed a linear interpolation data alignment (LIDA) algorithm to improve upon SDA. We tested our algorithms using sinusoidal input signals at different frequencies (10 to 210 Hz in increments of 20 Hz-frequencies spanning much of the relevant range of EEG, ECG, and EMG signals) on Texas Instruments (TI) CC26XX family devices, with two peripheral nodes communicating with one central node. The analysis was performed offline. The lowest average (+/- standard deviation) absolute time alignment error between the two peripheral nodes achieved by the SDA algorithm was 384.3 +/- 386.5 mu s, while that of the LIDA algorithm was 189.9 +/- 204.7 mu s. For all sinusoidal frequencies tested, the performance of LIDA was always statistically better than that of SDA. These average alignment errors were quite low-well below one sample period for commonly acquired bioelectric signals.	[Wang, He; Li, Jianan; Huang, Xinming; Clancy, Edward A.

However, such sensors may not be stable, resulting in high detection error rates. Thus, how to improve indoor positioning accuracy has become an important topic. This study explored Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon indoor positioning for smart home power management. A novel system framework using BLE Beacon was proposed to detect the user location, and to perform power management in the home through a mobile device application. Since the BLE Beacon may produce a multipath effect, this study used the positioning algorithm and hardware configuration to reduce the error rate. Location fingerprint positioning algorithm and filter modification were used to establish a positioning method for facilitating deployment, and to reduce the required computing resources. The experiments included an observation of the Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI) and selecting filters and a discussion of the relationship between the characteristics of the BLE Beacon signal accuracy and the number of the BLE Beacons deployed in the observation space. The BLE Beacon multilateration positioning was combined with the In-Snergy intelligent energy management system for smart home power management. The contribution of this study is to allow users to enjoy smart home services based on their location within the home using a mobile device application.

As a means of prevention, a number of active technologies have been developed to provide proximity sensing and alerts for workers and equipment operators. However, most of these systems are based on the distance/proximity level between workers and equipment and neglect the variations caused by different settings and environmental conditions, such as equipment types and approaching speeds, which can result in inconsistency and delay of the systems. As of yet, previous research has insufficiently investigated these issues. This research addresses the issues by utilizing the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based proximity sensing and alert system developed by the authors. This paper discusses the development and assessment of parameter adjustment and adaptive signal processing (ASP) methods. The research conducted field trials in various dynamic conditions and settings to assess the performance of the system. The test results showed that the parameter adjustment function reduced the inconsistency of the alert distances resulting from different types of equipment, and that the ASP method reduced the time delay resulting from high approaching speeds. The developed proximity safety alerts system provides stakeholders with better understanding of dynamic spatial relationships among equipment, operator, workers, and a surrounding work environment; thus, improving construction work zone safety.

Fingerprinting and analysis of Bluetooth devices with automata learning	FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN			English	Article; Early Access						Active automata learning; Model inference; Learning-based testing; Fingerprinting; Bluetooth Low Energy; IoT	INFERENCE	Automata learning is a technique to automatically infer behavioral models of black-box systems. Today's learning algorithms enable the deduction of models that describe complex system properties, e.g., timed or stochastic behavior. Despite recent improvements in the scalability of learning algorithms, their practical applicability is still an open issue. Little work exists that actually learns models of physical black-box systems. To fill this gap in the literature, we present a case study on applying automata learning on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. It shows that not only the size of the system limits the applicability of automata learning. Also, the interaction with the system under learning creates a major bottleneck that is rarely discussed. In this article, we propose a general automata learning architecture for learning a behavioral model of the BLE protocol implemented by a physical device. With this framework, we can successfully learn the behavior of six investigated BLE devices. Furthermore, we extended the learning technique to learn security critical behavior, e.g., key-exchange procedures for encrypted communication. The learned models depict several behavioral differences and inconsistencies to the BLE specification. This shows that automata learning can be used for fingerprinting black-box devices, i.e., characterizing systems via their specific learned models. Moreover, learning revealed a crashing scenario for one device.

J	Cha, SC; Chuang, MS; Yeh, KH; Huang, ZJ; Su, CH				Cha, Shi-Cho; Chuang, Ming-Shiung; Yeh, Kuo-Hui; Huang, Zi-Jia; Su, Chunhua			A User-Friendly Privacy Framework for Users to Achieve Consents With Near by BLE Devices	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE); BLE privacy; informed consent; Internet of Things (IoT); IoT privacy		The deployment of IoT devices with significant data collection capabilities around the world raises concerns about user privacy. People are worried about ubiquitous IoT devices collecting and sharing their data with unknown parties without their awareness or consent. Currently, several governmental agencies have stated that IoT service providers should obtain user consent before collecting and using their personal data. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no standard means for users to reach agreements on privacy practices for IoT applications. Among different types of IoT applications, this paper focuses on the scenario in which people use their personal smartphones to access nearby IoT devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). To address the privacy issue in the scenario, this paper proposes a privacy preferences expression framework for BLE-based applications named PrivacyBat. The framework defines specifications for users to achieve agreements on privacy practices with nearby BLE devices. In addition, this framework provides guidelines for a device to process user requests according to the agreement. To demonstrate how the framework operates, this paper further provides a proof of concept implementation. As the proposed framework can improve the privacy policy agreement process in IoT applications, this paper can hopefully contribute to increasing user trust in IoT applications.

These beacons are installed on signboards on the road and shops. We first explain the background of this research and related works. Then we describe the outline of our application to provide the information and knowledge of culture and history while walking the approach to the Tosyogu- shrine. We discuss how to layout the beacons to realize the sightseeing support navigation system for the visitors in Nikko. We mention that BLE beacon in outdoor worked well and if visitors are walking, they can find almost all beacons. The central theme of this paper is how BLE beacons work for travelers on a car or a bike in Nikko. Unfortunately, there are little researches to use BLE beacons for high-speed objects. To analyze this problem, we performed a trial to get information from a BLE beacon in a running vehicle. We founded that a smartphone received information from almost all BLE beacons by the receivers on a car or a bike. However, the order of the beacons is not in order as we expected and that caused problems if the coverage area of a beacon is overlapped. At last, we propose a simple formula to estimate the appropriate layout of beacons when we design the BLE beacon network for sightseeing by using a car or a bike.

A slotted microstrip layout has been chosen and optimized under both electromagnetic and manufacturing point of view to be fully integrated with the shoe and to guarantee a robust wireless link with the smartphone receiver, typically placed on the upper part of the body. For these reasons the same leather has been selected as antenna substrate material, and conductive fabric to design the radiating parts and the substrate. Both antenna directivity and circular polarization have been optimized to guarantee a robust communication while saving power. The antenna shows a very satisfying performance, with a -10 dB input matching frequency bandwidth equal to 10%, and an Axial-Ratio 3 dB bandwidth of 3%.	[Casula, G.

Batteries, which are today the most common source of energy supply for these devices, have many limitations. The limited capacity and the negative environmental effect of their production and recycling are among the most crucial ones. Energy harvesting has been proposed to overcome this problem. Over the past decade, the academia has produced thousands of papers on this topic, but it is still difficult to find a commercial sensor node operating solely with energy harvesting. One of the major reasons for this is the highly opportunistic and unreliable nature of the energy income from most of the available ambient energy sources. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a control loop enabling an energy harvesting sensor to request a recharge whenever needed. Energy-wise, the proposed method effectively transforms the operation mode of a passive wireless device from opportunistic to proactive, thus enabling an application to operate in a more predictable manner. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by implementing a real-life prototype Bluetooth Low Energy capable sensor node equipped with photovoltaic energy harvester, which can communicate and request a recharge from a commercial indoor smart lighting system.

This article focuses on the development of a scheme that, despite its low cost, acts as a smart antitheft system that achieves small property detection. Specifically, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based participatory platform was developed in order to allow asset-tracking tasks to be crowd-sourced to a community. Stolen objects are traced by using a prototype Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based system, which sends signals, thus becoming a beacon. Once such an item (e.g., a bicycle) is stolen, the owner informs the authorities, which, in turn, broadcast an alert signal to activate the BLE sensor. To trace the asset with the antitheft tag, participants use their GPS-enabled smart phones to scan BLE tags through a specific smartphone client application and report the location of the asset to an operation center so that owners can locate their assets. A stolen item tracking simulator was created to support and optimize the aforementioned tracking process and to produce the best possible outcome, evaluating the impact of different parameters and strategies regarding the selection of how many and which users to activate when searching for a stolen item within a given area.

These applications are only successful if a robust and cost-effective real-time system is developed for precise localization. Another aspect considered for indoor localization is power consumption. Recent wireless standards such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa consume less power which makes them a perfect candidate for indoor localization. This work aims to carry out an experimental evaluation which would help to decide which wireless standard i.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and LoRa are most suitable for indoor localization. Experiments are carried out using trilateration in three multiple environments. RSSI is used to calculate the coordinates of a sensor node. Results obtained from the experiment show that Wi-Fi is most accurate with an average error of 0.54 m. LoRa is second most accurate with an average error of 0.62 m and BLE is the least accurate with an average error of 0.82 m. These results can be used to decide which wireless standard is best suited for indoor localization.

Unfortunately, those sensors cannot avoid having noisy data due to their poor performance. Unpredictable indoor environments and a user's motion may also distort sensor data. For these reasons, an error-compensating algorithm is required. In this paper, we propose a compensated gyroscope sensor algorithm to clear away those noises. Also, we used Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) beacons based positioning system. It aims for reducing the compensated gyroscope sensor's cumulative error as well as providing precise user's initial point.

Recently, these smart environments are also being exploited to renovate the users' interest on the cultural heritage, by guaranteeing real interactive cultural experiences. In this paper, we design and validate an indoor location-aware architecture able to enhance the user experience in a museum. In particular, the proposed system relies on a wearable device that combines image recognition and localization capabilities to automatically provide the users with cultural contents related to the observed artworks. The localization information is obtained by a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) infrastructure installed in the museum. Moreover, the system interacts with the Cloud to store multimedia contents produced by the user and to share environment-generated events on his/her social networks. Finally, several location-aware services, running in the system, control the environment status also according to users' movements. These services interact with physical devices through a multiprotocol middleware. The system has been designed to be easily extensible to other IoT technologies and its effectiveness has been evaluated in the MUST museum, Lecce, Italy.

The slot antenna is formed on both a module substrate and a shield layer. The slot on the module substrate is short compared with the slot on the shield. Therefore, the slot occupies a small area on the module substrate, which makes the module substrate smaller. In addition to that, the slot antenna reduces the keep-out zone in which no wires can be laid out on the board. A prototype module was fabricated. The volume of the module is 5.25 x 9.0 x 1.0 mm(3). The module has received Japanese Radio Equipment Conformity Certification.

For example, the location-based management system and the last planner system have increased the reliability of planning and control in construction production. However, these benefits are often reduced because of inaccurate manual data collection. To alleviate these problems, technologies for automated monitoring of workers have been developed to identify site events in chaotic environments. This paper aims to investigate whether a Bluetooth low-energy-based real-time indoor positioning system can monitor task progress from workers' presence. Our findings suggest that the proposed system is a feasible solution for monitoring task-level progress when there are explicit dependencies between tasks. This method could automatically detect task start and finish times and estimate the hours required to complete a task. This enables the measurement of waste hidden inside tasks, which allows for interventions for improving flows and eliminating waste.

In recent years several mobile ticketing services have started to be developed and launched, but there is still a lot to be done in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and innovation. This paper presents a micro-location mobile ticketing solution based on Near Field Communication (NFC) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies, called Anda. This solution is based on a check-in/be-out scheme and requires the minimum intervention from the passenger. It is really innovative in the urban transport field, as it takes advantage of BLE technology not usually used for this purpose, it is based on a concept of post-billing with a fare optimization algorithm associated and it allows the micro-location of passengers throughout their journeys. This paper details the architecture of the solution and its mode of operation. It also presents the evaluation methodology that was followed during the pilot trial that took place in the Metropolitan Area of Porto (AMP), Portugal, during one year with 140 real passengers. A set of design lessons were identified as a result of the field tests and materialized in five mobile ticketing design dimensions, constituting important contributions to the design of future mobile ticketing services. Anda was commercially deployed in the AMP in 2018 and is used by thousands of passengers every day.

For those applications several methods can be used, such as a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or a wireless localization system. In this paper a topological map is used to implement a indoor localization system for smartphone users. Benefit of this kind of map is that the position is reduced to one dimension, which simplifies the localization process in a considerable way. The map consists of vertices, which could be important points such as crossings or a ending point of a path, and edges, which represent ways between the vertices. The localization process utilizes different sensors of the smartphone, such as the accelerometer, the pressure sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the integrated rotation sensor. To combine all of these information an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is introduced. To overcome crucial sensor information and thus to increase the robustness of the localization a multi hypotheses approach is implemented. Here different possible user positions on the topological map are instantiated and weighted. The implemented Kalman Filter is evaluated in several experiments which are recorded in an office building.

It supports continuous deployment principles; however, it is missing an option to monitor and control the experiment in real-time, which is required for experiment execution under comparable conditions. The paper describes the implementation of the experiment control and monitoring system (EC and MS) as the upgrade of the LOG-a-TEC testbed. EC and MS is implemented within existing infrastructure management and built systems as a new service. The EC and MS is accessible as a new tab in sensor management system portal. It supports several commands, including start, stop and restart application, exit the experiment, flash or reset the target device, and displays the real-time status of the experiment application. When nodes apply Contiki-NG as their operating system, the Contiki-NG shell tool is accessible with the help of the newly developed tool, giving further experiment execution control capabilities to the user. By using the ZeroMQ concurrency framework as a message exchange system, information can be asynchronously sent to one or many devices at the same time, providing a real-time data exchange mechanism. The proposed upgrade does not disrupt any continuous deployment functionality and enables remote control and monitoring of the experiment. To evaluate the EC and MS functionality, two experiments were conducted: the first demonstrated the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localization, while the second analysed interference avoidance in the 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e) wireless technology for the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

In this paper, a fuzzy indoor location methodology is proposed in a smart environment based on mobile devices and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons where a set of Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI) is received by mobile devices worn by the inhabitants. The use of fuzzy logic and a fuzzy linguistic approach is proposed to deal with the imprecise nature of the RSSI values, which are influenced by external factors such as radio waves, causing significant fluctuations. A case study carried out at the Smart Lab of the University of Jaen (UJAmI Smart Lab) is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, where our proposal is compared with a non-fuzzy logic approach, obtaining an accuracy of 91.63%, approximately 10 points higher than the methodology without using fuzzy logic. Finally, our theoretical proposal is accompanied by a description of the UJAmI Location system, which applies the theory to the functionality of locating elderly people in indoor environments.

The adaptation technique is applied in the fractional feedback loop to achieve highly accurate target frequency of digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). The range extension feature facilitates the DCO to generate stable frequency under severe phase noise. The polarity control for different BLE frequency channels is also incorporated in the proposed design. The external mode for debugging is embedded in the suggested architecture. The proposed DPFD is integrated in an ADPLL for BLE transceiver. The chip is fabricated with TSMC 55 nm CMOS technology. The DPFD occupies a very small area of 1830 mu m(2) and it requires only 1.906 K gates for its implementation. The current consumption is upto 40 mu A with 1 V power supply and it needs only 40 mu W power for its full operation. The measurement and simulation results verify the functional accuracy of the proposed fully synthsizable DPFD architecture.

This improvement allows producers to create location applications based on the Angle of Departure (AoD) and the Angle of Arrival (AoA). Accordingly, it is conceivable to design proper Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS), for instance, for the traceability of resources, assets, and people. First of all, Radio Frequency (RF) radiogoniometry techniques, helpful in calculating AoA and AoD angles, are introduced in this paper. Subsequently, the topic relating to signal direction estimation is deepened. The Bluetooth Core Specification updates concerning version 5.1, both at the packet architecture and prototyping levels, are also reported. Some suitable platforms and development kits for running the new features are then presented, and some basic applications are illustrated. This paper's final part allows ascertaining the improvement made by this new definition of BLE and possible future developments, especially concerning applications related to devices, assets, or people's indoor localization. Some preliminary results gathered in a real evaluation scenario are also presented.

Oversampling Highly Imbalanced Indoor Positioning Data using Deep Generative Models	2021 IEEE SENSORS	IEEE Sensors		English	Proceedings Paper	20th IEEE Sensors Conference	OCT 31-NOV 04, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Sensors Council		ADASYN; Bluetooth Low Energy; Conditional Variational Autoencoders; Imbalanced Data; Indoor Positioning; Location Fingerprints; Oversampling; Recurrence Plots; SMOTE; Variational Autoencoders		The location fingerprinting method, which typically utilizes supervised learning, has been widely adopted as a viable solution for the indoor positioning problem. Many indoor positioning datasets are imbalanced. Models trained on imbalanced datasets may exhibit poor performance on the minority class(es). This problem, also known as the "curse of imbalanced data," becomes more evident when class distributions are highly imbalanced. Motivated by the recent advances in deep generative modeling, this paper proposes using Variational Autoencoders and Conditional Variational Autoencoders as oversampling tools to produce class-balanced fingerprints. Experimental results based on Bluetooth Low Energy fingerprints demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms SMOTE and ADASYN in both minority class precision and overall precision. To promote reproducibility and foster new research efforts, we made all the codes associated with this work publicly available.

Although there are many technologies for indoor positioning e.g., Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), the high precision localization is still challenging because of the multipath effect and non-line of sight propagation of radio waves in complex indoor environment. This research proposes an explainable indoor localization (EIL) method for higher precision and integrity in IPS. The proposed localization method considered received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from BLE devices for predicting their precise locations. A recursive continuous Wavelet transform (R-CWT) method is proposed to extract discriminative features from the beacon signals for efficient localization. The extracted features are then fed to the extreme gradient boosting machine for the accurate classification of indoor positions. Moreover, to ensure integrity in indoor position classification, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method is introduced to interpret the results obtained from the gradient boosting machine. The proposed method (EIL) precisely localize BLE devices within 1.5 m in a superstore environment with an accuracy of 98.04% which is much higher than the reported accuracies in existing studies.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

To date, most reported implementations continue to rely on communication protocols designed for static WSN that often require synchronization. Synchronous protocols, such as ZigBee, have long association times before the nodes synchronize, which compromises performance for aerial data collection. Asynchronous protocols based on the IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer tailored for mobile WSN data collection have been proposed. However, low over the air bit rates limit the amount of sensing data transferred for each UAV visit. To obtain a higher bit rate, we have developed a dynamic protocol capable of switching between physical layers of IEEE 802.15.4 (IEEE mode) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE mode), which works as an extension of UAV Integrated WSN Protocol (UIWP). The BLE mode fits into the UIWP Data State which manages burst transmissions of data. BLE mode is implemented at a low cost in terms of RAM and ROM usage, which are several hundreds of bytes respectively. Experimental evaluation results show that BLE mode consumes 54% of time and 57% of energy for transmitting the same amount of data compared with IEEE mode.

The current state-of-the-art requires application-layer gateways both in software and hardware that provide application-specific connectivity to IoT devices. In much the same way that it would be difficult to imagine requiring a new web browser for each website, it is hard to imagine our current approach to IoT connectivity scaling to support the IoT vision. The IoT gateway problem exists in part because today's gateways conflate network connectivity, in-network processing, and user interface functions. We believe that disentangling these functions would improve the connectivity potential for IoT devices. To realize the broader vision, we propose an architecture that leverages the increasingly ubiquitous presence of Bluetooth Low Energy radios to connect IoT peripherals to the Internet. In much the same way that WiFi access points revolutionized laptop utility, we envision that a worldwide deployment of IoT gateways could revolutionize application-agnostic connectivity, thus breaking free from the stove-piped architectures now taking hold. In this paper, we present our proposed architecture, show example applications enabled by it, and explore research challenges in its implementation and deployment.

J	Nguyen, DD; Le, MT				Dai Duong Nguyen; Minh Thuy Le			Enhanced Indoor Localization Based BLE Using Gaussian Process Regression and Improved Weighted kNN	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Indoor localization; Bluetooth low energy; RSSI fingerprint; Gaussian process regression; machine learning	MACHINE; SYSTEM	Indoor positioning has attracted commercial developers and researchers in the last few decades. Global positioning system (GPS) cannot well localize in indoor environment. For clinical applications such as workflow analysis, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been employed to map the positions of individuals in indoor environments. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting plays a key role in the access point performance services. This paper deals with the issue of indoor localization based RSSI fingerprint using only RSSI vectors without any prior knowledge of the pose. We proposed to use machine learning (ML) combined with modified kNN algorithm to enhance the real-time performance and propose method to detect uncertainty of estimated pose. The mentioned ML algorithm is Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). In the online phase of our system, GPR gives a prediction for the location of the pose using RSSI vector. This prediction helps kNN algorithm therefore limits the searching region leading to reduce the computational cost. An analysis on the distribution of k nearest points is also presented which aims to evaluate the confidence of the estimated pose for extracting a list of trustable points. Furthermore, we also present an extrapolation process using this trust-list to have an optimized trajectory. The accuracy and timing analysis of our proposal was realized on a challenging BBIL dataset which contains very noisy RSSI signals due to a fast moving of the object. The experimental results show that our system exhibits a much better performance than traditional kNN or WkNN algorithms. The RMSE of our optimal trajectory is 1.78 m in the room with a dimension of 10 m x 25 m, which is competitive in comparison to other methods where initial pose is known.

Additionally, BLE is present in almost every smartphone, turning it into perfect ubiquitous remote control for smart homes, buildings or cities. Nevertheless, there is still room to improve BLE performance for typical IoT use cases where battery lifetime should reach several years. In this paper we propose an extension to a model for evaluating BLE performance, latency and energy consumption, in order to provide realistic results based on various scenario conditions. In addition, we propose a parameter optimization of the BLE Neighbor Discovery process, in order to obtain the best performance possible depending on the constraints of specific use cases. Our results on two typical IoT test-cases show that advertiser battery lifetime can be increased up to approximate to 89 x (9.55 days to 2.32 years) for a first case, and approximate to 281 x (9.55 months to 7.36 years) for a second case.

The Pico academic project proposes an authentication token unlocked by the proximity of simpler wearable devices that provide shares of the token's master key. This method, however, is vulnerable to a cold boot attack: an adversary who captures a running Pico could extract the master key from its RAM and steal all of the user's credentials. We present a cryptographic countermeasure-bivariate secret sharing-that protects all the credentials except the one in use at that time, even if the token is captured while it is on. Remarkably, our key storage costs for the wearables that supply the cryptographic shares are very modest (256 bits) and remain constant even if the token holds thousands of credentials. Although-bivariate secret sharing has been used before in slightly different ways, our scheme is leaner and more efficient and achieves a new property-cold boot protection. We validated the efficacy of our design by implementing it on a commercial Bluetooth Low Energy development board and measuring its latency and energy consumption. For reasonable choices of latency and security parameters, a standard CR2032 button-cell battery can power our prototype for 5-7 months, and we demonstrate a simple enhancement that could make the same battery last for over 9 months.

Indoors, self-location estimation can be performed by wireless LAN or beacon. However, for self-driving, more accurate position estimation is required. In previous research on self-driving of electric wheelchairs, there are methods using LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and laser range scanner. However, the conventional research has a problem that the system configuration is complicated and the power consumption also increases. In this study, we developed position estimation by deep learning using smartphone images with a positioning accuracy that allowed self-driving at low cost. Also, when the smartphone image recognition does not work, such as when the wheelchair approaches a wall, position estimation by augmented reality (AR) markers was used. In addition, a Bluetooth low-energy beacon was used to approximate the position when no marker could be seen. The route from an initial position to a destination was calculated using map information stored within the system. Experiments confirmed that the proposed system allows self-driving of an electric wheelchair along the route from its initial position to a destination. In this prototype system, we used the GPU board to calculate deep learning, but in the future we plan to concentrate the system on smart phones by calculating with the AI chip embedded in the smartphone.

To bring constrained embedded devices online, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has proven to be particularly popular for the low power sensors and actuators pervasive in the consumer IoT market. And yet, the gateways that facilitate cloud connectivity for such devices incur burdensome time, cost, and unreliability. This problem persists because current gateways conflate many application-specific functions, which continues to fuel the trend of requiring separate expensive, custom, and over-provisioned solutions for each brand or class of device to establish reliable network connectivity. One route to address the problem is the over-provisioned gateways at the heart of Apple and Google's smart home offerings. Another approach involves adding ephemeral gateway functions on pervasive connected devices like smartphones. In this paper, we explore a third approach that strips the gateway down to its bare essentials and eliminates the rest. We test the approach on the Espressif ESP32, a $3 microcontroller that contains built-in Wi-Fi and BLE radios, with a deployment of low-power IoT devices, evaluating the performance, drawbacks, and tradeoffs. Our results suggest that this is a promising technique for cost-sensitive applications with low deployment densities and aggregate data rates, but more capable design points may be preferred as these assumptions are relaxed.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid participatory sensing approach to capture large group dynamics. Specifically, our approach is based on distributing a large number of tiny, wearable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags and few smartphones among the group members. We start by identifying the best configuration; in terms of transmit power and beaconing interval; for detecting BLE tags in indoor and outdoor environments. Then, as a case study, we deploy the system during the six main days of the Hajj pilgrimage in 2014, which is the world's largest annual religious gathering. We used the proposed hybrid participatory approach to collect the mobility data of pilgrim groups based on GPS location and co-occurring BLE tag detections. Our system provided up to 80% group-wise detectability in a single scan event. Moreover, 98% cumulative unique tags detectability is achieved in the whole event, leading to 0.74 million records. Analysis of the group dynamics revealed unexpected behavior and interesting findings. In particular, regional variations are found among different groups in the entry or exit times, duration of stay, and group cohesion; which are attributed to congestion, improper arrangements, or the nature of activities. Furthermore, we show sub-community clusters could be identified revealing clear biases based on the demographic characteristics. Based on this case study, we also give suggestions on using the proposed system for other large-scale events.

One of the key concepts in this layer is the possibility for creating multiple Link Layer state machines (often abstracted as roles), which are able to run concurrently within the same physical device. As BLE is one of the most important technologies in the Internet of Things (IoT), this functionality attracted many researchers and developers. Possibly the most well-known state machine combination is the Advertiser-Scanner, that is used in relay devices of every multihop communication solution based on the broadcast mesh approach, but in other application areas there can occur many other combinations also, especially if one takes into consideration the edge (or fog) computing concept in the IoT world. For being capable to assess the key performance metrics (e.g. delay, throughput, etc.) of these state machines running concurrently on the same device, there was a simulator developed, which is presented in this paper, as well as the analysis of different scenarios (including their practical occurrence, possible bottlenecks and workarounds) based on the results obtained with it.

The radio frequency power amplifier (PA) design is getting more challenging and crucial. A PA for a 2.45 GHz IoT application using 0.18 mu m complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is presented in this paper. Design/methodology/approach The design consists of two stages, the driver and output stage, where both use a single-stage common source transistor configuration. In view of performance, the PA can deliver more than 20 dB gain from 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz. Findings The maximum output power achieved by PA is 13.28 dBm. As the PA design is targeted for Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transmitter use, a minimum of 10 dBm output power should be achieved by PA to transmit the signal in BLE standard. The PA exhibits a constant output third-order interception point of 18 dBm before PA becomes saturated after 10 dBm output power. The PA shows a peak power added efficiency of 17.82% at the 13.24 dBm output power. Originality/value The PA design exhibits good linearity up to 10 dBm out the PA design exhibits good linearity up to 10 dBm output power without sacrificing efficiency. At the operating frequency of 2.45 GHz, the PA exhibits a stability k-factor, the value of more than 1; thus, the PA design is considered unconditional stable. Besides, the PA shows the s-parameters performance of -7.91 dB for S11, -11.07 dB for S22 and 21.5 dB for S21.

In this scheme, the wireless link is considered to be error prone which leads to the existence of uncorrelated bit error. Our proposed scheme considers factors that cause a connection event to close. The effect of master's scheduling algorithm and BLE parameters on this scheme are also discussed to establish a comprehensive study on finding the throughput of a peripheral node in a BLE network. It is clear that an analytical model to formulate the throughput of a node offers a beneficial guideline for understanding the BLE throughput and ultimately the types of applications for which BLE technology would be a suitable option. We performed extensive experiments on the BLE v4.2 platform to investigate the throughput of a BLE node in a multipacket data transmission during a connection event. The results of our experimental study show some of the deficiencies that exist in the existing BLE devices such as the limitation on the maximum allowable packets during a connection event or the design of the scheduling process used by the central node.

More and more use-cases require secure remote user access increasingly incorporating handheld based human machine interfaces, using wireless links such as Bluetooth. Correspondingly secure operator authentication becomes of utmost importance. Unfortunately, often passwords with all their well-known pitfalls remain the only practical mechanism. We present an assessment of the security requirements for the industrial setting, illustrating that offline attacks on passwords-based authentication protocols should be considered a significant threat. Correspondingly use of a Password Authenticated Key Exchange protocol becomes desirable. We review the significant challenges faced for implementations on resource-constrained devices.

Then the electronics of Adam's Hand, a transradial myoelectric prosthesis for upper-limb amputees, is described. The device is equipped with sensors and actuators that simplify and aid the hand movements; in particular, the mechanism on which it is based can actuate 15 degrees of freedom with just one motor (instead of the five/six motors conventionally used in other commercially available prosthetic devices). Two servomotors are used to actuate the wrist movements. The myoelectric signals used to control the prosthesis are detected through the Myo armband, which integrates eight Electromyography (EMG) electrodes and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) based on InvenSense MPU-9150 IC; all these data are sent by Myo armband through BLE protocol to the realized control electronics which actuates the used motors.

J	Wu, TL; Xia, H; Liu, S; Qiao, YY				Wu, Tianli; Xia, Hao; Liu, Shuo; Qiao, Yanyou			Probability-Based Indoor Positioning Algorithm Using iBeacons	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor positioning; Bluetooth low energy; nearest neighbor; advanced weighted centroid; iBeacon; probability distributions		High-precision indoor positioning is important for modern society. This paper proposes a way to achieve high positioning accuracy and obtain a trajectory close to the actual path in a common application scenario by smartphone without the use of a complicated algorithm. In the actual positioning process, a stable signal source can reduce the signal interference caused by environments. Bluetooth low energy has its own advantages in indoor positioning because it can be seen as a more stable signal source. In this study, we used smartphones to record the changing Bluetooth signals and used a basic nearest neighbor, weight centroid, and probability-based method, which we called an advanced weighted centroid method, to obtain position coordinates and the motion trajectory during the experiment. We used a weight centroid method based on least squares to solve the overdetermined problem. This can also be used to calculate the initial position of the advanced weight centroid. The advanced weighted centroid method introduced a Gaussian distribution to model the distribution of the signal. Translating a deterministic problem into a fuzzy probability problem aligns more with positioning facts and can achieve better results. Experimental results showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the dynamic positioning result obtained through the probabilistic method was within 1 m and had a more consistent trajectory.

The proposed system consists of a primary and secondary sub-system which work in tandem to recognize static gestures signed by the user. Each of the sub-systems consists of a sensory glove, embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors interfaced with a ATMega328 microcontroller. The two sub-systems are wirelessly inter-connected through a pair of TI's CC2541 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The system recognizes gestures with the help of a Dual-mode Intelligent Agent (DIA) which operates in Identification Mode (IM) and intelligently switches to Enhanced Identification Mode (EIM) when the gesture fails to get recognized in IM. The EIM incorporates a Bit Stream Error Elimination (BSEE) algorithm which enhances the gesture recognition accuracy without the addition of any external hardware. The performance of the system was evaluated using a data set comprising of 196 static gestures from eight globally used sign languages. The system efficiency was found to be 80.06% in IM and was enhanced to 93.16% in EIM. The cost of the proposed system in prototype stage is USD 22, which the authors believe could be realized at under USD 10 on commercialization.

Fusion particle and fingerprint recognition for indoor positioning system on mobile	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Particle filter; Optimization; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Fingerprint recognition; Fusion sensor; Indoor Position System (IPS)		High accuracy localization is easily obtained in an exterior context with GPS, but the development of indoor positioning systems remains a challenge. The GPS signals, by nature, cannot penetrate walls thus preventing this technology to provide any service indoor. This paper proposes a practical implementation of an accurate Indoor Positioning System based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology to ensure a low power, efficient and easy to setup infrastructure. It is available on any current Smartphone and requires no extra devices for the user. We use a fusion of the inertial sensors available on the device to output a precise and drift-free estimation of the user displacement, leverage this information with iBeacon radio signals used as anchors to readjust the path if needed and process all these inputs in a Particle Filter. We augmented the Fingerprinting-based likelihood calculation of the particles position's with a unique simulation of the particle's theoretical RSSI and also reduced the number of particles to better fit within the bounds of the computational capabilities of mobile devices. The experiment was conducted in a 400 m(2) open space and yielded positive results as a first attempt in accurate indoor localization and proved to be viable in an indoor context.

Presently, five clinical performance indicators are used to decide patient satisfaction. Unfortunately, the emergency ambulance services in rapidly growing metropolitan areas do not meet current satisfaction expectations; because of human errors in the management of the objects onboard the ambulances. But, human involvement in the information management of emergency interventions can be reduced by electronic tracking of personnel, assets, consumables and drugs (PACD) carried in the ambulances. Electronic tracking needs the support of automation software, which should be integrated to the overall hospital information system. Our work presents a complete solution based on a centralized database supported by radio frequency identification (RFID) and bluetooth low energy (BLE) identification and tracking technologies. Each object in an ambulance is identified and tracked by the best suited technology. The automated identification and tracking reduces manual paper documentation and frees the personnel to better focus on medical activities. The presence and amounts of the PACD are automatically monitored, warning about their depletion, non-presence or maintenance dates. The computerized two way hospital-ambulance communication link provides information sharing and instantaneous feedback for better and faster diagnosis decisions. A fully implemented system is presented, with detailed hardware and software descriptions. The benefits and the clinical outcomes of the proposed system are discussed, which lead to improved personnel efficiency and more effective interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A well-established fingerprint database plays an important role in positioning, especially enhancing positioning accuracy. In literature, there are studies that consider only one type of measurements such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth RSS, but these values are not sufficient alone to overcome the problems in dynamically changed environments. In order to deal with this, we propose a novel fingerprint database that contains both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth RSS values in addition to magnetic field measurements obtained from mobile devices. In addition to this, the proposed database also contains Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RSS values obtained from preplaced sensor nodes in the experimental environment. The aims of this fingerprint database are to enhance accuracy, precision, and robustness of the location estimation system to dynamically changed environment and to satisfy researchers' needs who are deal with different problems in indoor positioning.

The primary goal is to save battery lifetime by converting nodes into a mesh network in a balanced mode and thus increasing the lifetime of the network. Based on an extension of the flooding protocol Trickle, the proposed protocol, Drypp, aims to balance the loads of the network nodes. Hence it seeks to make nodes with a higher load more active in the network in comparison to nodes with a lower load. A performance analysis will be executed, comparing the proposed protocol and Trickle. The metrics of node lifetime, network lifetime, throughput and node battery loads will be analyzed.

Our approach to localize the mobile node is based on the relative change in the RSSI values obtained from BLE network, provided the knowledge of certain area specific information. The main advantage of this approach is that even the large environmental changes in the working area creates very less effect on the localization results. A new RSSI smoothing algorithm is proposed in such a way that it reduces the effect of sudden environmental changes on RSSI values. We have also formulated an integer optimization problem, where path loss exponent is optimized subject to a given area specific information. Since this problem is Non-deterministic Polynomial-time Hard (NP-Hard), we have presented sub-optimal solution to this problem, which are far better than the state-of-the-art approaches presented in the literature. Our proposed approaches provide an accuracy of average error in distance of 1.162 meter.

New technologies are emerging aiming at an energy-efficient communication. Among them, Bluetooth Low Energy is an appealing solution. Recently, the specifications of Bluetooth 5 have been presented with the purpose to offer significant enhancements compared to the earlier versions of the protocol. Bluetooth 5 comes with new communication modes that differ in range, speed, and energy consumption. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based solution to cope with the selection of the communication mode, among those introduced with Bluetooth 5, that allows the best energy efficiency. This communication mode, used by mobile devices, is dynamically regulated by varying the transmission power, returned as the output of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented to achieve the optimal parameters of the proposed FLC, i.e., optimizing the triangular membership functions, by varying their range, to reach the best results concerning the battery life of mobile devices. The proposed FLC is based on triangular membership functions because they represent a good trade-off between computation cost and efficiency. The paper presents a detailed description of the FLC design, a logical analysis of the PSO algorithm for the derivation of best performance conditions values, and experimental assessments, obtained through testbed scenarios.

As the demand of cold storage services is growing rapidly nowadays, attention paid on occupational safety of warehouse workers is increasing under extreme working environment. Traditionally, the safety of workers are assessed by their experience and personal judgement. Without automatic data capturing tools, it is hard to monitor the actual health status of workers who may be dangerous when working too long in the cold storage facilities. In addition, there is a lack of prompt signal to managers and first-aid teams for instant treatment when the workers get cold injuries or illnesses. Therefore, the real-time health monitoring and positioning of the workers are in need. Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a mean of real-time interconnection system in which target objects are equipped with the identifying and sensing technologies. This paper presents an IoT-based occupational safety management system (IoT-OSMS) by using the identifying and sensing techniques to locate workers' positions and to guarantee the occupational safety. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a kind of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) solutions, is used to locate and collect the information of the workers inside the cold storage facilities. The workers' locations are calculated by using Trilateration with Taylor's series adjustment and Kalman filter. On the other hand, fuzzy logic technique is used to examine and generate the customized cold stress and monitoring review cycle. By integrating the positioning and Fuzzy logic approaches seamlessly, it is found that the occupational safety of warehouse workers can be guaranteed and monitored in the real-time situation.

Especially, struck-by accidents still account for about 38% of the total injuries in the US construction industry. Although there have been several efforts to mitigate the hazards, the statistics show that the hazards still persist. To provide a practical solution to this problem, this study proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-based proximity warning system that provides an alert to workers whenever they are close to heavy equipment. The system includes equipment protection units (EPUs), personal protection units (PPUs), and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons. A framework of signal processing and alert logic was developed to estimate the distance between PPUs and EPUs and to activate alerting modules timely. By calculating the distance based on the signal strength using a particle filtering method, EPUs and PPUs provide auditory and vibration alerts to equipment operators and workers when they are in an alert range. Also, practical alert logic was developed based on the site worker's feedback. This study validates the system performance with different signal processing methods and alert logic through five real-world field tests. The system achieved a precision, recall, and F1-score of 89.21%, 97.45%, and 0.931 from the field tests, respectively. Also, positive feedback was obtained from the participating workers. The proposed IoT-based proximity warning system has a high potential for a practical solution to proximity hazards in actual construction sites.

CRC Error Correction in IoT Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; cyclic redundancy check (CRC); error correction; IEEE 802.15.4; short-range internet-of-things (IoT)	CODES	In this paper, error correction is introduced to the Bluetooth low energy and IEEE 802.15.4 standards by utilizing data redundancy provided by cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes used by both protocols to detect erroneous packets. A scenario with an energy-constrained transmitter and a constraint-free infrastructure is assumed that enables additional signal processing at the receiving side, keeping the transmitter intact. CRC error correction is achieved using a novel approach of applying iterative decoding techniques. The proposed methods are evaluated based both on simulated and real packets. It is shown that by enabling CRC error correction, up to 2.5 dB of the signal to noise ratio gain can be achieved, while up to 35% of real corrupted packets can be corrected, at no extra cost for the transmitter. This results in potential range extension and longer battery life caused by a reduced number of retransmissions.

Similar to other BAW resonators, the dual-Bragg acoustic resonator (DBAR) utilizes piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) thin film between two metal electrodes. However, the DBAR operation requires no cavity on either side of the resonant body. This unique micro-acoustic resonator technology enables cost-effective system integration in mass production. The first system application is a novel network synchronizer based on an integrated ultra-low noise voltage-controlled BAW oscillator (VCBO). When operating as a jitter cleaner, the synthesized output clock rms jitter can be reduced to less than 60 fs (12 kHz - 20 MHz). The second application uses this 2.5 GHz DBAR-oscillator as a high-frequency reference clock, achieving a +/- 30 ppm Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) compliant crystal-less radio.

Most such IoT devices comparatively employ short-range radio access technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to transfer sensor data. When a WSN is situated in a remote region such that neither regular human monitoring is plausible nor Internet coverage is readily available, it requires an alternative method to gather data from sensor nodes. Hence, in this research, an attempt was made to improve the data collection process and monitor the parametric performance of a low power IoT WSN aided by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The impact of physical parameters related to different sensor node arrangements was investigated to effectively utilize the total flying time of the drone. Subsequently, adjustments were proposed for improvements by referring to previous literature. The Hamiltonian path defined in Graph Theory was applied to reduce the traverse distance of the drone further by tracing the sensor nodes within the grid area systematically. A prototype was implemented using commercially available devices to demonstrate the feasibility and the functionality of the proposed solution. Our results show that the proposed system increases the data collection performance by 23% compared to referenced architecture.

Especially, not limited to the service that can assist to people directly such as public safety, healthcare, proximity-based service, mobile payment, etc., a technology that can provide convenience indirectly such as asset tracking has also been proposed. Most of all, the indoor location awareness using BLE beacon is the essential technique that can realize these services, it is expected to be more focused if the more BLE beacon is spread in the future. In this paper, we first analyse practical path loss model of BLE signals with compared to that of Wi-Fi signals in order to take advantage of the BLE beacon for indoor positioning. To estimate the practical path loss model, we employed four BLE beacons (each two beacon is the same manufacturer) and two of Wi-Fi AP. Each signal was measured during one minute at each reference distance from 1m to 13m (with 2m interval) in a Line-of-Sight (LOS) environment. The calculated path loss model was used to generate a BLE signal virtually, we applied the model to configure the BLE radiomap and generate positioning measurement data in our simulation. Since BLE signal has relatively lower tx power compared to Wi-Fi APs, it requires much more beacons to achieve comparable positioning accuracy. We focused on the relationship between the number of installed beacon and its positioning accuracy in this paper.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with the highest penetration rate in consumer products has an important role in enabling IoT applications. BLE version 5 has recently been developed to meet the versatile requirements of IoT use cases. In this paper, we investigate the practical performance of BLE5 in indoor office environment, and study the performance of its novel features. Our evaluation metrics in this study are throughput and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). In this study, BLE5 measurements are conducted by using nRF52840 chip from Nordic Semiconductor. The acquired measurement results indicate that new Physical Layers (PHYs) of BLE5 provide extended coverage and improves the throughput in indoor scenarios. The 2 Mbps uncoded PHY significantly improves the throughput in good RSSI zones. However, the throughput drastically drops in case of zones with moderate to weak RSSI. In particular, the feature of the coded physical layer helps extending the Bluetooth coverage, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) scenarios.

The practicality comes from the application of the forward algorithm and the small parameter set used to build the hidden Markov model (HMM). A Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacon navigating in the environment publishes BLE packets which are captured by the stationary sensors. Fingerprints are formed by collecting received signal strength indicators (RSSI) of these packets, which are then processed into a high resolution emission matrix using a histogram combination technique. We convert the map of the area into a grid structure, the resolution of which is controlled by the grid cell size. The transition matrices are built by Gaussian blur masks parametrized by the size and diffusion extent. As the transition matrix is highly sparse, we make the exact inference tractable by adopting a sparse matrix representation and by intelligently controlling the mask size, diffusion factor and grid cell size. Filtering can then be directly performed by the forward algorithm given a series of real RSSI measurements along real trajectories. We measure the performance of the system by comparing the most likely positions at each step with the ground truth positions. We achieve promising results and evaluate the approach also by the runtime and memory usage.	[Danis, F. Serhan] Galatasaray Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ersoy, Cem; Cemgil, A.

These PHY-CTC works are commonly achieved by emulating the target signal waveform of the receiver. However, signal emulation suffers from inherent unreliability due to imperfect emulation, and it only supports few communication channels. When applied in WiFi to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scenario, it will face two challenges: i) a BLE receiver can not tolerate any bit error in a frame, while emulation errors are easy to appear; and ii) the BLE device performs channel hopping while most BLE channels are unavailable for emulation based CTC. To address these challenges, we present WiBle, a high reliable and all-channel supporting PHY-CTC from WiFi to BLE. The key technical insight of WiBle is symbol transition mapping: When a symbol is transmitted by a WiFi sender and flows into a BLE receiver, it will leave some unique signatures which can be leveraged to extract information. More specifically, it is observed that the phase shifts of BLE received signal can be mapped to the transitions of WiFi symbols. Therefore, by carefully selecting the symbols at the WiFi sender, we can generate the desired phase shifts for correct BLE GFSK demodulation and achieve reliable CTC. Evaluation results on both USRP and commodity chip show that WiBle outperforms state-of-the-art CTCs by higher reliability (> 95% frame reception ratio), wider channel coverage (supporting all 40 BLE channels), and higher throughput (974.3Kbps), under a full range of configurations including indoor/outdoor and LoS/NLoS settings.

Leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), an iBeacon technology enabled device that can be used to establish a region around an object and identify whenever the device enters or exits the region. In this paper we introduce a reminder application which monitors our location and provide us with the corresponding reminders which we have already fed into the application. The iOS device can alert applications when we approach or leave a location using iBeacon. Each time the iOS device enters the beaconic region, the application notifies the user with the corresponding reminders. Thus this application implements Internet of things with the communication of an iBeacon with an iOS device. We envision that the application of the proposed method lead to significant time conservation and automation of the reminders.

For instance, for a large scale moving crowd, a minor accident can create a panic for the people to start stampede. Although many smart video surveillance tools, inspired by the recent advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning (ML) algorithms, enable object detection and identification, it is still challenging to predict the crowd mobility in real-time for preventing potential disasters. In this paper, we propose an intelligent crowd engineering platform using mobility characterization and analytics named ICE-MoCha. ICE-MoCha is to assist safety management for mobile crowd events by predicting and thus helping to prevent potential disasters through real-time radio frequency (RF) data characterization and analysis. The existing video surveillance based approaches lack scalability thus have limitations in its capability for wide open areas of crowd events. Via effectively integrating RF signal analysis, our approach can enhance safety management for mobile crowd. We particularly tackle the problems of identification, speed, and direction detection for the mobile group, among various crowd mobility characteristics. We then apply those group semantics to track the crowd status and predict any potential accidents and disasters. Taking the advantages of power-efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ubiquitous availability, we specifically use and analyze a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signal. We have conducted experiments of ICE-MoCha in a real crowd event as well as controlled indoor and outdoor lab environments. The results show the feasibility of ICE-MoCha detecting the mobile crowd characteristics in real-time, indicating it can effectively help the crowd management tasks to avoid potential crowd movement related incidents.

When we use a single communication protocol such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)/Wi-Fi with low range, the data has to pass through multiple hops for data transfer. This in turn, increases the delay for data transmission. Even though LoRa protocol supports longer distances, the delay is more due to the limited bandwidth. Thus, in this work, we propose a hybrid BLE/LTE/VVi-Fi/LoRa switching scheme that consumes lower energy in addition to reducing the average delay in the network. The proposed scheme switches between the communication technologies based on the lower energy consumption. The performance of the proposed hybrid switching scheme is compared with the individual communication protocols in terms of both energy consumption and average delay. Through extensive numerical results, we show that the proposed hybrid switching scheme performs better in comparison to the individual communication technologies.	[Wilson, A.

BLE Mesh: A Practical Mesh Networking Development Framework for Public Safety Communications	TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						public safety communications; device to device; bluetooth low energy; mesh networking; development framework		Owing to advanced storage and communication capabilities today, smart devices have become the basic interface between individuals and their surrounding environment. In particular, massive devices connect to one other directly in a proximity area, thereby enabling abundant Proximity Services (ProSe), which can be classified into two categories: public safety communication and social discovery. However, two challenges impede the quick development and deployment of ProSe applications. From the viewpoint of networking, no multi-hop connectivity functionality component can be directly operated on commercially off-the-shelf devices, and from the programming viewpoint, an easily reusable development framework is lacking for developers with minimal knowledge of the underlying communication technologies and connectivity. Considering these two issues, this paper makes a twofold contribution. First, a multi-hop mesh networking based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is implemented, in which a proactive routing mechanism with link-quality (i.e., received signal strength indication) assistance is designed. Second, a ProSe development framework called BLE Mesh is designed and implemented, which can provide significant benefits for application developers, framework maintenance professionals, and end users. Rich application programming interfaces can help developers to build ProSe apps easily and quickly. Dependency inversion principle and template method pattern allow modules in BLE Mesh to be loosely coupled and easy to maintain and update. Callback mechanism enables modules to work smoothly together and automation processes such as registration, node discovery, and messaging are employed to offer nearly zero-configuration for end users. Finally, based on the designed ProSe development kit, a public safety communications app called QuoteSendApp is built to distribute emergency information in close area without Internet access. The process illustrates the easy usability of BLE Mesh to develop ProSe apps.

It implements an Internet of Things (IoT) network that continuously monitors the health conditions of these people. The network includes mobile phones, to transmit the data generated by the IoT sensors to the cloud server. Especially, the paper proposes the 3rd party unknown mobile relays instead of dedicated gateways as opposed to many existing solutions for IoT healthcare applications. The wireless communication technology used to provide the connectivity between the sensor nodes and mobile relays is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). To establish a secure end-to-end connectivity between low power IoT sensor nodes and cloud servers, the paper proposes several techniques. After the medical data transmission to the cloud server, it is responsible for emergency detection and alert generation accordingly. The type of emergency is not limited to a specific health issue, but new emergency situations can be defined and added to the proposed system. Ultimately, the interested parties such as family members, caretakers and doctors receive these alerts. The development of a prototype of the system as a part of the work using commercial off-the-shelf devices verifies the validity of the proposing system and evaluates the performance advantage over the existing systems.

Recently, various indoor positioning methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), visible light communication, Japan's indoor messaging system, ultra-wide band (UWB), and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), have been investigated. The development of these technologies allows tracking of movement of both people and/or goods in indoor spaces, people and/or goods behavior analysis is expected as one of the key technologies for operation optimization. However, when we use these technologies for human tracking, there are some problem as follows. 1) Many cases need to use dedicated facilities (e.g. UWB). 2) When we use smartphone as sensing device, battery depletion is one of the big problem (especially using PDR). 3) the accuracy is instability for tracking (e.g. Wi-Fi). Based on these matters, in this study we designed and developed an indoor positioning system using BLE positioning. And, we adopted smartphone for business use as sensing device, developed a smartphone application runs on android OS. Moreover, we conducted the field test of developed system at Itoki Corporation's ITOKI Tokyo Innovation Center, SYNQA, office (Tokyo, Japan). Over 40 workers participated in this field test, and worker tracking log data were collected for 6 weeks. We analyzed the characteristics of the workers' behavior using this log data as a prototyping.

BLE-beacon-based indoor localization techniques use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the beacon signals. The variations of RSSI in an indoor environment is unpredictable and make the indoor localization challenging. Earlier researches considered that the distribution of RSSI in shadowing pathloss model is a normal (Gaussian) in the logarithmic scale. In an indoor environment, signals arrive at the receiver via various paths each having RSSI with Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we show that the aggregated magnitude of the indoor multipath signals at the receiver can also be modeled with Nakagami-m distribution. We investigate the performance of a BLE-based indoor localization technique using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the shadowing pathloss model with Nakagami-m distribution. We compare the location estimation performance when Gaussian distribution is used. We also collect data from a BLE test-bed and analyze the distribution of the RSSI measurements. The root means square error of the estimated position error for Nakagami-m based MLE solution is consistently lower than that of the Gaussian-based technique. In the computational time comparison, Nakagami-m distribution also shows a better performance speeding up the location estimation process by almost eight times.

J	Ng, PC; She, J; Ran, R				Ng, Pai Chet; She, James; Ran, Rong			A Compressive Sensing Approach to Detect the Proximity Between Smartphones and BLE Beacons	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon; compressive sensing (CS); differential evolution (DE); Internet of Things; proximity detection	SIGNAL RECOVERY; BLUETOOTH; LOCALIZATION; STEP	Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons have been widely deployed to deliver proximity-based services (PBSs) to user's smartphones when users are in the proximity of a beacon. Conventional proximity detection simply uses the received signal strength (RSS) to infer the proximity, and then retrieves the PBS by mapping the beacon ID with the corresponding service in the cloud database. Such an approach suffers two major issues: 1) the severe RSS fluctuation might confuse the smartphone during the detection and 2) a malicious PBS can be delivered by manipulating the same beacon ID. This paper proposes RF fingerprinting to label a beacon with an N-dimensional fingerprint vector, which consists of N RSS values from N deployed beacons. The contribution of our proposed method is twofold: 1) we infer the proximity based on the fingerprint vector instead of relying solely on the single RSS value and 2) we retrieve the PBS by mapping the fingerprint vector instead of the hard-coded beacon ID. The challenge with our proposed approach is the incomplete fingerprint observation during real-time detection, resulting in an underdetermined proximity detection problem. To this end, we exploit the compressive sensing (CS) approach based on the differential evolutional algorithm to address such an underdetermined problem. Extensive simulations with real-world datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms the legacy machine learning techniques with substantial performance gains.

J	Sadowski, S; Spachos, P				Sadowski, Sebastian; Spachos, Petros			RSSI-Based Indoor Localization With the Internet of Things	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Indoor localization accuracy; power consumption; Internet of Things; RSSI; WiFi; Bluetooth low energy; Zigbee; LoRaWAN	SYSTEM	In the era of smart cities, there are a plethora of applications where the localization of indoor environments is important, from monitoring and tracking in smart buildings to proximity marketing and advertising in shopping malls. The success of these applications is based on the development of a cost-efficient and robust real-time system capable of accurately localizing objects. In most outdoor localization systems, global positioning system (GPS) is used due to its ease of implementation and accuracy up to five meters. However, due to the limited space that comes with performing localization of indoor environments and the large number of obstacles found indoors, GPS is not a suitable option. Hence, accurately and efficiently locating objects is a major challenge in indoor environments. Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) along with novel wireless technologies can alleviate the problem. Small-size and cost-efficient IoT devices which use wireless protocols can provide an attractive solution. In this paper, we compare four wireless technologies for indoor localization: Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11n-2009 at the 2.4 GHz band), Bluetooth low energy, Zigbee, and long-range wide-area network. These technologies are compared in terms of localization accuracy and power consumption when IoT devices are used. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values from each modality were used and trilateration was performed for localization. The RSSI data set is available online. The experimental results can be used as an indicator in the selection of a wireless technology for an indoor localization system following application requirements.

Through extensive simulations, we analyze the impact of the configuration of all the different protocol's parameters on the end-to-end reliability, delay, and scalability. In particular, we focus on the structure of the packet broadcast process, which takes place in time intervals known as Advertising Events and Scanning Events. Results indicate a high degree of interdependence among all the different timing parameters involved in both the scanning and the advertising processes and show that the correct operation of the protocol greatly depends on the compatibility between their configurations. We also demonstrate that introducing randomization in these timing parameters, as well as varying the duration of the Advertising Events, reduces the drawbacks of the flooding propagation mechanism implemented by the protocol. Using data collected from a real office environment, we also study the behavior of the protocol in the presence of WLAN interference. It is shown that Bluetooth mesh is vulnerable to external interference, even when implementing the standardized limitation of using only 3 out of the 40 Bluetooth low-energy frequency channels. We observe that the achievable average delay is relatively low, of around 250 ms for over 10 hops under the worst simulated network conditions. However, results prove that scalability is especially challenging for Bluetooth mesh since it is prone to broadcast storm, hindering the communication reliability for denser deployments.

J	Amr, MN; ELAttar, HM; Abd El Azeem, MH; El Badawy, H				Nagah Amr, Mohammed; ELAttar, Hussein M.; Abd El Azeem, Mohamed H.; El Badawy, Hesham			An Enhanced Indoor Positioning Technique Based on a Novel Received Signal Strength Indicator Distance Prediction and Correction Model	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor positioning; RSSI; correction factor; Bluetooth Low Energy; beacon; enhanced centroid positioning algorithm	LOCALIZATION	Indoor positioning has become a very promising research topic due to the growing demand for accurate node location information for indoor environments. Nonetheless, current positioning algorithms typically present the issue of inaccurate positioning due to communication noise and interferences. In addition, most of the indoor positioning techniques require additional hardware equipment and complex algorithms to achieve high positioning accuracy. This leads to higher energy consumption and communication cost. Therefore, this paper proposes an enhanced indoor positioning technique based on a novel received signal strength indication (RSSI) distance prediction and correction model to improve the positioning accuracy of target nodes in indoor environments, with contributions including a new distance correction formula based on RSSI log-distance model, a correction factor (Beta) with a correction exponent (Sigma) for each distance between unknown node and beacon (anchor nodes) which are driven from the correction formula, and by utilizing the previous factors in the unknown node, enhanced centroid positioning algorithm is applied to calculate the final node positioning coordinates. Moreover, in this study, we used Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to meet the principle of low energy consumption. The experimental results of the proposed enhanced centroid positioning algorithm have a significantly lower average localization error (ALE) than the currently existing algorithms. Also, the proposed technique achieves higher positioning stability than conventional methods. The proposed technique was experimentally tested for different received RSSI samples' number to verify its feasibility in real-time. The proposed technique's positioning accuracy is promoted by 80.97% and 67.51% at the office room and the corridor, respectively, compared with the conventional RSSI trilateration positioning technique. The proposed technique also improves localization stability by 1.64 and 2.3-fold at the office room and the corridor, respectively, compared to the traditional RSSI localization method. Finally, the proposed correction model is totally possible in real-time when the RSSI sample number is 50 or more.

They often rely on alternatemethods to supplement or replace verbal communication. There is a rapidly growing number of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) mobile applications available over recent years. However, the operation of these applications remains a challenge for users with ID since they may not have the sufficient cognitive proficiency to cope with the application interface. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based context-aware AAC system. Our system facilitates daily communication for nonverbal school children with moderate ID in order to address their learning and communication needs. We have piloted and evaluated our system at a special education school in Hong Kong. Our technical contribution is twofold. First, we introduce BLE technology to the AAC field and show its effectiveness on users with ID. Second, by converting conventionally standalone AAC software into a service system and empowering it with Internet of Things functionality, we open up many new opportunities brought by the system-of-systems (SoS) paradigm for the intellectually disabled population.

However, no current standard of wireless communication protocol (WCP) can fully address those scenarios. Our focus in this paper is to introduce treNch, a novel WCP implementing the cross-layer principle to use the power input for adapting its operation in a dynamic manner that goes from pure best-effort to nearly real time. Together with the energy-management algorithm, it operates with asynchronous transmissions, synchronous and optional receptions, short frame sizes and a light architecture that gives control to the nodes. These features make treNch an optimal option for wireless sensor networks with ultra-low power demands and severe energy fluctuations. We demonstrate through a comparison with different modes of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a decrease of the power consumption in 1 to 2 orders of magnitude for different scenarios at equal quality of service. Moreover, we propose some security optimizations, such as shorter over-the-air counters, to reduce the packet overhead without decreasing the security level. Finally, we discuss other features aside of the energy needs, such as latency, reliability or topology, brought again against BLE.

"Things" that are immensely connecting to the Internet, are now creating "Smart" systems. However, heterogeneous devices and the dominance of propriety protocols are still the major challenges for practical application of such systems. This research work presents a practical application of a real-time microwave sensing system for the evaluation of tissues moisture. The work addresses two major challenges; first, the use of a highly sensitive microwave sensor to determine tissue moisture; second, to share the measurement with the remote users through an IoT-based system over the Bluetooth low-energy radio using open standards and protocols. The prototype shows significant changes in its resonance frequency, return loss and bandwidth (5.5%-26%) for the measured moisture content, which is also validated. This implementation demonstrates the feasibility of real-time monitoring of food quality. It also enables data-analytics that may help the industries to improve product quality, supply-chain and predicts demand in a more effective manner.

With two stages, NUPFA constructs the scatternet in a distributed manner. In the first stage, the master and slave nodes discover each other using low-level power to form an initial scatternet. In the second stage, each master alternatively scans or advertises using normal power to interconnect dual links among any two piconets until the whole scatternet is constructed. Using nonuniform power configuration, an energy-efficient scatternet is generated, since packet transmission power can be reduced in each piconet to minimize overall power consumption. With additional scatternet links, more routing paths can be utilized to reduce the path length and enhance network efficiency. simulation results show that compared with the existing cluster-based on-demand routing protocol (CORP) and Bluetooth Mesh schemes, the NUPFA protocol achieves superior energy efficiency for packet transmission. Also, the dual link features can effectively reduce packet latency, thereby improving the overall performance of BLE mesh networks.

The proposed architecture improves the efficiency of the conventional constant-supply switching PAs by a factor of 3 in low power mode, resulting in power saving of nearly 1mW at -10dBm output power. The TX benefits from a compact 0.1mm(2) PLL operating with an IPN of 0.83 degrees at 2.4GHz and spot phase noise of -119.4dBc/Hz at 3MHz offset. The chip is fabricated in a 40nm LP CMOS process with a die area of 0.7mm(2). The proposed transmitter consumes 6.1mW at 3dBm output power in BLE mode and 1.6mW at -10dBm for BAN applications, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported power consumption among the BLE transmitters in similar process node.

The system comprises a compact printed circuit board (PCB) that integrates a potentiostat analog-front-end (AFE) and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) microcontroller with an electrochemical DO sensor. In situ detection of DO within the bioreactor is enabled via a 3-D printed ABS-M30i shell, representing a robust and biocompatible packaging solution for prolonged monitoring. The platform is evaluated in a bench-scale bioreactor filled with aqueous media, and data is extracted wirelessly via a custom-developed application. A linear response corresponding to DO saturation levels was achieved using chronoamperometry (CA), exhibiting a dynamic voltage range between 1.3 V (-4.9 mu A) and 0.87 V (-11.1 mu A), corresponding to 0% and 100% DO saturation respectively, with a sensitivity of 6.3 mV/DO%.

However, the positioning system generally suffers from a large error in localization and has low solidity. The main approaches widely used for indoor localization are based on the inertial measurement unit (IMU), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband. The major problem with Bluetooth-based fingerprinting is the inconsistency of the radio signal strength, and the IMU-based localization has a drift error that increases with time. To compensate for these drawbacks, in the present study, a novel positioning system with IMU sensors and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon for a smartphone are introduced. The proposed trusted K nearest Bayesian estimation (TKBE) integrates BLE beacon and pedestrian dead reckoning positionings. The BLE-based positioning, using both the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Bayesian estimation, increases the accuracy by 25% compared with the existing KNN-based positioning, and the proposed fuzzy logic-based Kalman filter increases the accuracy by an additional 15%. The overall performance of TKBE has an error of <1 m in our experimental environments.

Since it is a new virus, it takes some time to develop a vaccine against it. Until then, the best way to prevent the fast spread of the virus is to enable the proper social distancing and isolation or containment to identify potential patients. Since the virus has up to 14 days of the incubation period, it is important to identify all the social interactions during this period and enforce social isolation for such potential patients. However, proper social interaction tracking methods and patient prediction methods based on such data are missing for the moment. This paper focuses on tracking the social interaction of users and predict the infection possibility based on social interactions. We first developed a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and GPS based social interaction tracking system. Then, we developed an algorithm to predict the possibility of being infected with COVID-19 based on the collected data. Finally, a prototype of the system is implemented with a mobile app and a web monitoring tool. In addition, we performed a simulation of the system with a graph-based model to analyze the behaviour of the proposed algorithm and it verifies that self-isolation is important in slowing down the disease progression.

Finding lost properties in complex buildings using information and communication technologies (ICE) will be one of the LBS for smart city initiatives. The valued properties such as briefcase, mobile phone, wallet, handbag, and laptop may have a chance to be lost or are moved to somewhere in a building. If the property is lost, it could he staying in the same area when it was lost or be moved to anywhere both outside and inside building. GPS technique is used to search the lost property on the outdoor by the mobile or web application. However, indoor environment, it is very restrictive and doesn't have standard devices for looking for the property. Moreover, inside the building, some situations lead to being complicated such as closing corridor, electric shut down, or closing escalator. in this research, we develop an indoor space ontology model for finding the indoor lost property. The Bluetooth Low Energy devices (BLE) are applied to this research for analyzing the indoor locations. This ontology presents both static and dynamic location information for assisting BLE devices, users, and lost property. The privacy policy is design into the ontology to consider accessing to private lost property. This ontology can apply to 3-step searching process: computing user current location, determine property location and find lost property.

With acoustic mirrors also placed on top of the resonator, this symmetrical DBAR (dual-Bragg acoustic resonator) structure offers extra design freedoms to alter the resonator's acoustic properties. A DBAR requires no cavity on either side of the resonator yet still immune to mass loading effect from contamination and assembly. This advantage enables cost-effective system integration by directly marrying a DBAR and a CMOS die in a plastic package. System chips utilizing DBAR as the high-frequency reference clocks are demonstrated here. With compensation algorithm and careful design of the package, these DBAR-based clocking systems can achieve +/- 25 ppm stability over the entire operation temperature range (including aging, solder shift, etc.), resulting industry's first crystal-less BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) radio chip.

This consists the procedure of identifying and detecting internal cracks and damages in the infrastructures due to aging, natural calamity or any other human-made reason well in time so that a preventive measurement can be undertaken before it collapses. However, most of the already existing SHM systems face challenges and problems performing at a real-time scenario due to lack of robustness and portability. Moreover, the remote and constant monitoring appliances are not implemented yet properly. So, with the help of Internet of Things (IoT) we have proposed a solution of SHM which is both portable and robust in nature. Our proposed device can be mounted on a concrete beam, metal structure, slabs, bridge joints, gusset plates, beam-column joints etc. This device measures the inclined angles and analyses bends where it's mounted and send the data to smartphone app through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for real-time viewing. It can also send raw data to the cloud storage through a Wi-Fi module for future research and analysis. This device uses flex sensors to monitor the slightest bending from where it is mounted. Whenever, deformation happens the device gives alert to the inhabitants by buzzing an alarm and lighting the LED which is the outcome of constant monitoring without any human interaction. All raw data are processed through inbuilt processor.

The platform is also equipped to support the study of indoor localisation using the Time of Flight of radio signals to evaluate the distance between nodes. Although initially designed around the Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology, LocURa4IoT now embarks Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa transceivers which are co-located with the UWB nodes. This opens the way to the study of network approaches taking advantage of heterogeneous physical layers. This paper describes the architecture of the LocURa4IoT testbed and introduces 2 datasets collected on the platform: one is centered on the UWB physical layer and the other exploits the embedded BLE transceiver. Key results regarding the ranging error and the impact of walls are highlighted.

This sensor system uses a motion capture system and a thin film force/pressure sensor which enables to measuring the depth and the force/pressure at the same time during abdominal palpations. We customised the motion capture system, making it suitable for abdominal palpations, to prevent a physician from being distracted and to eliminate blind spots. We fabricated a detecting circuit for the force/pressure sensor which uses a Bluetooth low energy module and which is powered by a coin cell battery. The circuit enables mounting the detecting circuit on a glove. In addition, we developed a user interface application which is easy to use and which records the information on abdominal palpations on a personal computer. The abdominal palpation sensor system should transfer the diagnostic criteria to young physicians more easily and appropriately in traditional medicine.

Slots are patterned on both an interposer and a shield layer. The slots are connected at the side of the interposer and compose the slot antenna. A large part of the slot antenna is formed on the shield deposited on the surface of the module. The slot on the interposer is short and occupy a small area, therefore the slot antenna allows the area of the interposer to be reduced. In addition to that the slot antenna reduces the keep-out zone in which no wires can be laid out on the board. It is because the area of the slot on the interposer is small. A prototype of the module with a Bluetooth Low Energy chip was fabricated. The volume of the prototype is 5.25 x 9.0 x 1.0 mm(3). The keep-out zone of the module is 9.0 mm(2). The module has received Japanese modular approval certification because it contains all the elements for wireless communication except for a power supply.

The paper also describes about the features of BLE, BLE Protocol Stack, and its network topology. BLE is a wireless personal area network intended to provide less power consumption and cost while maintaining the similar communication range as that of the Classic Bluetooth. The project uses the nRF_SDK_14.0.0 Software Development Kit (SDK) and the soft device used is s132. The technology behind this is Internet of Things, which is an advanced and efficient solution for connecting the devices through the internet. The DK can be connected to a smart phone and the RSSI values can be checked after the connection. RSSI value indicates the power level being received after all the losses from the transmitted signal and from the antenna. Thus, the paper describes the improvement in the range of BLE by changing different Radio Frequency (RF) parameters and Antenna using NRF52832.

When designing an IPS, a popular approach involves using wireless networks to calculate the approximate location of the target from devices with predetermined positions. In many smart building applications, LBS is necessary for efficient workspaces to be developed. In this article, we examine two memoryless positioning techniques, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes, and compare them with simple trilateration, in terms of accuracy, precision, and complexity. We present a comprehensive analysis between the techniques through the use of three popular IoT wireless technologies: 1) ZigBee; 2) Bluetooth low energy (BLE); and 3) WiFi (2.4-GHz band), along with three experimental scenarios to verify results across multiple environments. According to experimental results, KNN is the most accurate localization technique as well as the most precise. The received signal strength indicator data set of all the experiments is available online.

In communication, it utilizes transceivers like wireless sensor network (WSN). In spite of the conventional WSN, a key component of IoT is its direct engagement with humans (animals). Therefore, communication is required in audio-visual ranges. This means an IoT device (IoTD) will be ported with audio amplifiers. This paper presents a novel IoT transceiver with a reconfigurable PA-CDA with time-domain and task-oriented multiplexing. The run-time reconfiguration of an area-power-efficient common part is utilized. The topology and scheduling issues of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard are well-suited to the proposed architecture. Time, energy, and protocol concerns are studied and appropriate models presented. The PA and CDA operate in the 2.4 GHz and audio-range frequencies, respectively. The battery life and power consumption are improved by about 40% and 20%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Ghorbani, A. R.; Ghaznavi-Ghoushchi, M.

Comparing to conventional usage of advertisement and broadcasting, the interacting with digital signage has gained great interest for researchers due to hot issue of Internet of Thing. In these days, the ubiquity of smartphone and the development of sensor make it possible to apply more intuitive interaction with digital signage. A new navigation system which combined UHD (Ultra High Definition) display with personal smartphone is proposed. User is allowed to control Web-based 3D model instead of 2D subway map through smartphone's gyroscope sensor. In this paper, multi user access approach is proposed by applying multi sub screen in UHD Signage system with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tech and a novel WebSocket server design. Different from one-to-one control, this approach provides multi-to-multi accessibility that allows multiple users to access the navigation system simultaneously. A novel Web Socket server design reduces the delay and provides better control experience for multiple users' accession. This technology makes user able to access system sequentially, according to the access time and the distance between user and signage. The distance information is provided by iBeacon which attached to the UHD display. The result shows better feasibility when applied this navigation system to solve wayfinding problem inside complex subway station.

Two pathloss models based on weighted centroids and non-negative least squares estimation are presented: one including a floor loss factor, and the other one ignoring the floor losses, and the three signal types are compared in terms of the path-loss parameters, channel fluctuations and positioning accuracy, namely the distance errors and floor detection probabilities. The comparison is done based on real-field measurement data collected from a university building in Tampere, Finland. It is shown that all these three signal types have similar shadowing variances and close path-loss parameter values, and that a path-loss model considering floor losses gives the best floor detection probability, but not necessarily the smallest distance error.

It was found also, that air quality metrics, such as CO2 level, temperature, humidity, noise, and illumination are far from optimal in facilities having sensor networks capable of capable of measuring such parameters, and in some cases, they are out of the range allowed by national standards. Unfortunately, there is very limited data available, and it is possible, that this problem is wide scale, but currently the lack of low-cost solutions to monitor these parameters makes it very hard to assess the situation. In the paper, we present an environmental monitoring solution based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, primarily for educational facilities, which can reproduce the system with minimal investment. The system based on low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless sensor boards and BLE-WIFI gateway using a ubiquitous single board computer (SBC) board. The software components are open source, as the BLE sensor board software is available from the manufacturer as an application example, the SBC uses Linux, and our software will be available as free, open-source software. The system does not only monitor these environmental parameters but can provide feedback for the occupants of the facility using LEDs on the sensor boars. We are going to present our preliminary results showing the applicability of our solution.

Due to the widespread availability of IEEE 802.11, many localization platforms have been proposed, based on the Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) indicator, using algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method that combines the simplicity (and low cost) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the popular 802.11 infrastructure, to improve the accuracy of indoor localization platforms. Building on KNN, we propose a new positioning algorithm (dubbed i-KNN) which is able to filter the initial fingerprint dataset (i. e., the radiomap), after considering the proximity of RSS fingerprints with respect to the BLE devices. In this way, i-KNN provides an optimised small subset of possible user locations, based on which it finally estimates the user position. The proposed methodology achieves fast positioning estimation due to the utilization of a fragment of the initial fingerprint dataset, while at the same time improves positioning accuracy by minimizing any calculation errors.

Existing work on CTC has showcased the ability of exchanging data between diverse wireless standards, but has not analysed the challenges nor tackled the problem of enabling CTC between multiple constrained IoT platforms with different characteristics. Indeed, CTC schemes are often hacked on very specific hardware platforms, which results in a lack of a general, portable solution. Furthermore, CTC has always been tested as a standalone piece of functionality, and its seamless integration with the classical operations of a constrained IoT device remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present X-Burst, a portable framework that allows multiple constrained IoT platforms with diverse characteristics to seamlessly interact using CTC. X-Burst allows to customize the CTC working principle (e.g., how information is encoded, or the alphabet used to encode a symbol) and enables the combination of different encoding and decoding strategies independently of the employed hardware platform. Thanks to its high modularity, X-Burst also simplifies the development of alternative CTC implementations and makes it easy to compare different approaches. As a proof of concept, we integrate X-Burst into the Contiki operating system without changing Contiki's core functions and allow an IoT device to seamlessly support CTC in parallel to its normal operations. We then showcase the functionality of X-Burst by enabling a bidirectional CTC between off-the-shelf heterogeneous IoT platforms based on IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). An experimental evaluation further shows X-Burst's small memory footprint and analyses the robustness and throughput of different encoding schemes.

The sensor system reports the temperature and color sensor output frequency change of the culture bottle when the device is triggered. After the culture process is finished, a nitrite ion detecting solution based on a commercial nitrite ion detection kit is injected into the culture bottle by a syringe pump to check bacterial growth by the formation of a pigment by the reaction between the solution and the color sensor. Sensor status and NRA results are broadcasted via a Bluetooth low energy beacon. An Android application was developed to collect the broadcasted data, classify the status of cultured samples from multiple devices, and visualize the data for the end users, circumventing the need to examine each culture bottle manually during a long culture period. The authors expect that usage of the developed sensor will decrease the cost and required labor for handling large amounts of patient samples in local health centers in developing countries. All 3D-printerable hardware parts, a circuit diagram, and software are available online.

One of the most attractive IoT applications is in the modern healthcare area, as the traditional healthcare system has an increasing demand for social resources, including doctors, nurses, hospital beds, and health monitoring devices. In this article, the design of a compact wearable sensor patch is presented for measurements of different physiological signals, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and body temperature. As ECG and PPG sensors are integrated with the same device, the proposed sensor patch can be used to estimate blood pressure (BP) continuously based on the pulse arrival time (PAT) without extra wires and devices. The sensor patch consists of a center board for signal acquisition and processing, a power board for energy supply and charging batteries, and three sensors for vital signs monitoring. All the components are designed in a rigid-flex structure, which can be easily attached to the human body for remote health monitoring applications. The sensors can be detached from the center board for customized measurements of a certain physiological signal (e.g., ECG) to reduce power consumption. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed sensor patch by comparison with a commercial reference device. With the integration of a miniaturized Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) module, the proposed sensor system can transmit physiological measurements wirelessly to a gateway. Data encryption is applied on both the sensor patch and gateways to protect data for privacy and security purposes during transmission. Both a mobile gateway (based on smartphones) and a fixed gateway (based on portable computers) are designed as the bridge between the wearable sensor system and the Internet cloud, where health data can be stored and further analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the overall platform for IoT-connected healthcare applications.

The aim of this study is to design and develop a reliable and robust wireless network that can eradicate accessibility of a device's human interface. An embedded system supplied by an energy harvesting source, installed on the portable computer device, may represent one of multiple slave nodes which request regular updates from a standalone master station. A portable computer device which is operated in an undesignated area or in a field perimeter where master to slave communication is restricted, indicating a possible theft scenario, will initiate a shutdown of its operating system and render the device unusable. Consequently, an algorithm in the device firmware may ensure the necessary steps are executed to track the device, irrespective whether the device is enabled. Design outcomes thus far indicate that a wireless network using low-power embedded hardware, is feasible for anti-theft applications. By incorporating one of the latest Bluetooth low-energy, ANT+, ZigBee or Thread wireless technologies, an anti-theft system may be implemented that has the potential to reduce major portable computer device theft in institutions of digitized learning.

J	Hirsch, C; Davoli, L; Grosu, R; Ferrari, G				Hirsch, Christian; Davoli, Luca; Grosu, Radu; Ferrari, Gianluigi			DynGATT: A dynamic GATT-based data synchronization protocol for BLE networks	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet of Things (IoT); Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Generic ATTribute (GATT); Internet Gateway; Dynamic network; Smart agriculture	IOT; AGRICULTURE	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication technology for power-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) applications. BLE data can be transmitted via either the IPv6 or the Generic ATTribute (GATT) Profile protocol, with the former supporting dynamic IoT structures and the latter being application-friendly. In fact, GATT requires the data layout to be known in advance by peer devices, in order to properly interpret the received data. In this paper, we introduce DynGATT, a protocol that achieves the benefits of both IPv6 and GATT, by extending GATT in a seamless fashion to support dynamic IoT structures. The key idea of DynGATT is to use GATT descriptors, originally intended to specify data in static IoT scenarios, to also specify IoT systems whose structures may dynamically evolve. Peer devices reading these descriptors will know how to interpret the data of GATT characteristics provided by devices joining the IoT network. Because no additional data have to be transmitted, the connection time is then reduced with respect to classical BLE. DynGATT has been implemented and tested in an agricultural IoT application, with different types of sensor nodes. Our experimental evaluation shows that DynGATT is very power-efficient, despite its added flexibility. Its worst-case power consumption is only around 19.37 mu A per data transmission and around 41.37 mu A overall. This consumption can be further reduced by using the methods discussed in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to support dynamic IoT structures in a GATT-based setting.

The design exploits particular aspects of BLE, such as the relaxed in-band interference characteristics, more precisely the C/I-1 MHz, and the relatively high-frequency-shift keying modulation index, to deliver a high level of energy efficiency and simplicity to the receiver baseband architecture. Reliable quadrature signals are generated in the RF signal path without consuming energy, which is supported by an inverter-based low-noise amplifier (LNA) that achieves high gain and low noise figure under low-power budgets. A small-signal analysis of low-power inverter-based LNAs is presented offering simple design equations. Seeking an affordable solution, the fabricated prototype is fully integrated into an earlier generation CMOS technology node (0.13 mu m), occupying a silicon area smaller than 0.7 mm(2). The receiver achieves a sensitivity level of -92 dBm while consuming 1.41 mA from a 1.2-V supply.

Energy Autonomous Wireless Sensing Node Working at 5 Lux from a 4 cm(2) Solar Cell	JOURNAL OF LOW POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						energy harvesting; low power; solar cell; capacitive sensing; Bluetooth Low Energy; low light; power management; comparator	SENSOR	Harvesting energy for IoT nodes in places that are permanently poorly lit is important, as many such places exist in buildings and other locations. The need for energy-autonomous devices working in such environments has so far received little attention. This work reports the design and test results of an energy-autonomous sensor node powered solely by solar cells. The system can cold-start and run in low light conditions (in this case 20 lux and below, using white LEDs as light sources). Four solar cells of 1 cm(2) each are used, yielding a total active surface of 4 cm(2). The system includes a capacitive sensor that acts as a touch detector, a crystal-accurate real-time clock (RTC), and a Cortex-M3-compatible microcontroller integrating a Bluetooth Low Energy radio (BLE) and the necessary stack for communication. A capacitor of 100 mu F is used as energy storage. A low-power comparator monitors the level of the energy storage and powers up the system. The combination of the RTC and touch sensor enables the MCU load to be powered up periodically or using an asynchronous user touch activity. First tests have shown that the system can perform the basic work of cold-starting, sensing, and transmitting frames at +0 dBm, at illuminances as low as 5 lux. Harvesting starts earlier, meaning that the potential for full function below 5 lux is present. The system has also been tested with other light sources. The comparator is a test chip developed for energy harvesting. Other elements are off-the-shelf components. The use of commercially available devices, the reduced number of parts, and the absence of complex storage elements enable a small node to be built in the future, for use in constantly or intermittently poorly lit places.

The power consumption in these devices is dominated by the wireless transceivers which limit the battery's lifetime. Different strategies have been proposed to tackle these issues both in physical and network layers. The ultimate goal is to lower the power consumption without sacrificing other important metrics like latency, transmission range and robust operation under the presence of interference. Joint efforts in designing energy-efficient wireless protocols and low-power radio architectures result in achieving sub-100 mu W operation. One technique to lower power is back-channel (BC) communication which allows ultra-low power (ULP) receivers to communicate efficiently with commonly used wireless standards like Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) while utilizing the already-deployed infrastructure. In this paper, we present a review of BLE back-channel communication and its forms. Additionally, a comprehensive survey of ULP radio design trends and techniques in both Bluetooth transmitters and receivers is presented.

The Ph-ADC linearly combines the in-phase and quadrature parts of the incoming signal, and the generated phase-shifted versions are fed to comparators to detect the zero-crossings and build a 4-b digital representation of the signal phase. Seeking for a low-area and low-power consumption realization, our proposal employs a resistor-less scheme which performs phase rotations in current domain. Together with the Ph-ADC, the fully integrated GFSK demodulator also includes a channel-filtering programmable gain amplifier and a symbol decision block. Altogether, the demodulator occupies 0.14 mm(2) in a 0.13-mu m CMOS technology with a total power consumption of 190 mu W from a 1-V supply. For a data rate of 1 Mbps and 0.5 modulation depth, the GFSK demodulator requires an E-B/N-o of 14.8 dB for a bit error rate of 0.1% considering a flicker noise corner of 150 kHz, obtains a dynamic range of 74 dB, and is able to tolerate carrier frequency offsets of +/- 170 kHz. This performance safely complies with the requirements of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard.

For duty-cycled low-power devices, energy consumption is closely related to neighbor discovery latency. Actually, in recent protocols, such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) or ANT+, neighbor discovery latency is determined by the parameters used by the devices, such as advertising interval, scan window, scan interval, and so on. A fundamental problem of the BLE-like protocol is that the exact relation between parameters and discovery latency has not been fully analyzed. In this article, we propose a Euclidean-division-based low-complexity precise analytical approach that can derive the mathematical expressions of both worst-case latency and average latency for any parameter groups. It is confirmed by simulation results that our solution can make highly accurate predictions about the value of latencies. Simulation results also show that the proposed solution has an extremely low complexity. Moreover, we derive the lower bound of latency for given duty cycles, which provides useful guidelines for the choice of energy-efficient parameter groups for BLE.

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is a protocol widely used in IoT. For BLE, it has low cost, low energy consumption, and is supported on most types of mobile phones. BLE Beacon which is widely applied in many situations, such as shopping malls and indoor navigation, is an application based on the BLE network. This paper is aimed at proposing a feasible scheme to enhance the performance of the BLE Beacon application. communications in BLE networks involve the neighbor discovery process (NDP) in the first phase to create a connection or exchange information with neighbors. When more people with mobile devices simultaneously send requests to the BLE Beacon, the success probability of the NDP decreases and then the latency of the NDP increases. It leads to poor customer experience. Therefore, we propose an Early Wake-Up and Access Barring (EWAB) scheme to improve the NDP performance among an advertiser and multiple scanners. The scheme makes good use of the information that can be contained in the advertising packet to adjust the scan interval and the backoff window dynamically. The results show that EWAB provides better performance in terms of the probability of successful discovery, the mean discovery latency, and power consumption in the BLE networks.

J	Kong, XT; Wu, C; You, Y; Yuan, YF				Kong, Xiaotong; Wu, Chang; You, Yuan; Yuan, Yifei			Hybrid Indoor Positioning Method of BLE and PDR Based on Adaptive Feedback EKF With Low BLE Deployment Density	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Adaptive feedback extended Kalman filter (AFEKF); Bluetooth low energy (BLE); hybrid indoor positioning algorithm; pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)	FOOT-MOUNTED IMU; KALMAN FILTER; NAVIGATION; TRACKING; SYSTEM; GNSS; UWB	Location-based service (LBS) has gradually penetrated into all aspects of human life. The current indoor positioning algorithms include triangulation, least squares, fingerprint, maximum likelihood estimation, and so on. These positioning algorithms have requirements for the deployment density of the access point (AP). Since the AP deployment density is directly related to the equipment cost, the AP-based positioning method has a high-cost problem that cannot be ignored. Furthermore, the positioning accuracy of traditional algorithms will sharply decline in the positioning field with low AP deployment density. In order to solve the positioning problem in application scenarios with low AP deployment density, this article proposes a hybrid indoor positioning method of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) based on the adaptive feedback extended Kalman filter (AFEKF). The AFEKF algorithm uses an adaptive feedback EKF to deeply fuse the position of the BLE, the range measurement, and the result of PDR localization, making full use of the information of the BLE (the position, the orientation, and the range measurement) instead of only the range measurement. The range measurement is deeply fed back to the estimated position, thus adaptively adjusting the position estimate at the next moment, making the position estimate more accurate and the algorithm more robust.

For instance, Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies offer low data rate communication over long distance, whereas Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) technologies can reach higher data rates, but with a reduced range. For simple IoT applications, communication requirements can be fulfilled by a single technology. However, the requirements of more demanding IoT use cases can vary over time and with the type of data being exchanged. This is pushing the design towards multimodal approaches, where different wireless IoT technologies are combined and the most appropriate one is used as per the need. This paper considers the combination of Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as communication options for an IoT device that is running a Lightweight Machine to Machine/Constrained Application Protocol (LwM2M/CoAP) protocol stack. It analyses the challenges incurred by different protocol stack options, such as different transfer modes (IP versus non-IP), the use of Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) techniques, and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) security modes, and discusses the impact of handover between both communication technologies. A suitable end-to-end architecture for the targeted multimodal communication is presented. Using a prototype implementation of this architecture, an in-depth assessment of handover and its resulting latency is performed.

Self-corrective knowledge-based hybrid tracking system using BIM and multimodal sensors	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Building Information Model (BIM); Inertial Measurement Units (IMU); Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Data fusion	FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY; SAFETY MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; WIRELESS	Researchers have recently devoted considerable attention to acquiring location awareness of assets. They have explored various technologies, such as video cameras, radio signal strength indicator-based sensors, and motion sensors, in the development of tracking systems. However, each system presents unique drawbacks especially when applied in complex indoor construction environments; this paper classifies them into two categories: absolute tracking and relative tracking. By understanding the nature of problems in each tracking category, this research develops a novel tracking methodology that uses knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of various components used in the proposed tracking system. This paper presents the development of a hybrid-tracking system that integrates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, motion sensors, and Building Information Model (BIM). The hypothesis tested through this integration was whether such knowledge-based integration could provide a method that can correct errors found in each of the used sensing technologies and thereby improve the reliability of the tracking system. Field experimental trials were conducted in a full-scale indoor construction site to assess the performance of individual components and the integrated system. The results indicated that the addition of map knowledge from a BIM model showed the capability of correcting improbable movements. Furthermore, the knowledge-based decision making process demonstrated its capability to make positive interaction by reducing the positioning errors by 42% on average. In sum, the proposed hybrid-tracking system presented a novel method to compensate for the weakness of each system component and thus achieve a more accurate and precise tracking in dynamic and complex indoor construction sites.

Identification and distance estimation of users and objects by means of electronic beacons in social robotics	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electronic beacons; Social robots; Human-robot interaction; Bluetooth Low Energy; User identification; Object identification	BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; SYSTEM	Social robots are intended to coexist and to communicate with humans in a natural way. This requires these robots to be able to identify people (and objects) around them to use that information during human-robot dialogs. In this work we present how electronic beacons can benefit the interactions between humans and social robots. In particular, Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy beacons are presented as the most suitable option, among the up-to-date available technologies. In order to show the advantages of the system during human-robot interaction, first, we present the integration of the information provided by these devices in the robot's dialog system; and after, a hidden toy hunt game is described as a case study of a scenario where electronic beacons ease the interaction between humans and a social robot.

In the absence of synchronization, it is impossible to relate all the measurements coming from the different sub-systems on a single time scale for the extraction of complex features. The importance of this issue is even bigger when the sensors' sampling rate is high as for the Inertial Measurement Unit platforms. The paper addresses the issue of managing a large multi-sensor platform for off-line activities with a reduced sensor node complexity and guaranteeing the perfect synchronization for each acquired sample. The new simple and light algorithm proposed overcomes the limits of the commonly used protocols and it is suitable for this kind of applications. The entire system consists of an Android smartphone, a master unit and several slave units. Each board has a 9 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) Inertial Measurement Unit, a micro-SD for data storage and an ARM (R) Cortex (TM)-M4 CPU SoC supporting the protocols for both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 and 2.4 GHz custom communications.

In this article, we propose a real-time indoor tracking and positioning system using BLE beacon and smartphone sensors. Up to now, most of the system is using Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR). The initial position is considered to have a high impact on the accuracy of PDR, so, based on the analysis of received signal strength (RSS), we present a method to estimate the approximate distance, then, estimate the initial position through Trilateration technique. Next, we propose a lightweight and reliable fingerprint method. This method addresses two problems: (1) to correct errors due to the initial position error and orbital drift of PDR, (2) to reduce the amount of data, number of reference points and collecting data time. The proposed system is implemented on the smartphone as an application. To verify the accuracy of the system, we performed some experiments. The results show that the system not only achieves high accuracy but also the high performance with average complexity and low cost.

Design/methodology/approach The linearization mechanism is executed with an aid of a passive linearizer implemented at the gate of the main amplifier to minimize the effect of C-gs capacitance through the generation of opposite phase response at the main amplifier. The inductor-less output matching network presents an almost lossless output matching network which contributes to high gain, PAE and output power. The linearity performance is improved without the penalty of power consumption, power gain and stability. Findings With this topology, the PA delivers more than 20 dB gain for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Band from 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz with a supply headroom of 1.8 V. At the center frequency of 2.45 GHz, the PA exhibits a gain of 23.3 dB with corresponding peak PAE of 40.11% at a maximum output power of 14.3 dBm. At a maximum linear output power of 12.7 dBm, a PAE of 37.3% has been achieved with a peak third order intermodulation product of 28.04 dBm with a power consumption of 50.58 mW. This corresponds to ACLR of - 20 dBc, thus qualifying the PA to operate for BLE operation. Practical implications The proposed technique is able to boost up the efficiency and output power, as well as linearize the PA closer to 1 dB compression point. This reduces the trade-off between linear output power and PAE in CMOS PA design. Originality/value The proposed CMOS PA can be integrated comfortably to a BLE transmitter, allowing it to reduce the transceiver's overall power consumption.

The carrier frequency is set with a finite-modulo fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL) in order to achieve a low start-up time of 5.5 mu s. The LC-based VCO is directly modulated using simple pMOS transistors to change the tank capacitance. Measurements verify that the carrier frequency and the frequency deviation meet the requirements of the Bluetooth low energy standard up to 85 degrees C even considering supply voltage variations of 1.0 V +/- 10%. The FSK synthesizer only consumes 600 mu W and drives a power amplifier (PA) with a differential class-E output stage. An integrated step-up transformer is used to up-convert the antenna impedance to a load impedance of 840 Omega seen by the PA. The overall transmitter consumes 8.9 mA and delivers +1.9 dBm to the antenna, which means a total power efficiency of 17.4%.

We have developed a mobile application for a smartphone and a smartwatch to collect beacon signals from BLE beacon sensors as well as to store information about the participants' household rooms. Our goal is to collect beacon information about the time the participants spent in different rooms of their household to infer sociability information. We applied the same technology and setup in an internal experiment with healthy volunteers to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in 10 different home setups, and we observed an average accuracy of 97.2%. Moreover, we show that it is feasible for the clinical study participants/caregivers to set up the BLE beacon sensors in their homes without any technical help, with 96% of them setting up the technology on the first day of data collection. Next, we present results from one-week location data from study participants collected through the proposed technology. Finally, we provide a list of good practice guidelines for optimally applying beacon technology for indoor location monitoring. The proposed algorithm enables us to estimate time spent in different rooms of a household that can pave the development of objective sociability features and eventually support decisions regarding drug efficacy in ASD.

This novel solution is based on the Bluetooth protocol called FatBeacon, created by Google, which can be used in places such as subway stations located below ground, outdoor areas where even 2G coverage is unreachable or simply as an alternative to current technologies that may require an additional cost, such as the Internet in some countries. In particular, this work describes a new solution for supporting tourism called Smart Tourism for which an interactive and non-intrusive guidance application based on the FatBeacon protocol is presented. The developed application informs the users about the way to reach their destination without getting lost and can be used to obtain user data tracking anonymously. In this way, the cooperation between the different systems and components of the scheme creates a distributed ecosystem that is independent of an Internet connection. Since no FatBeacon implementations can be found yet, an experimental implementation was developed to test the proposal, and the obtained results are promising.

However, localization accuracy has always been a challenge. The Kalman filter (KF) is a well-known estimation in the Bayesian framework, but can only deal with linear problems and Gaussian models. A particle filter (PF) is another essential estimation tool in a Bayesian system. However, a critical challenge with PF is the problem of particle degradation after resampling. To mitigate the particle degradation problem in PF, unsupervised learning based on k-means clustering is proposed in this paper. It forms clusters of similar particles based on the sum of weights. Also, we present enhancing the PF by utilizing a map constraint and k-means clustering (PFMK) and integrating Bluetooth low energy (BLE) along with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) for positioning. BLE and PDR-based positioning with a map constraint lead to an increase in accuracy of at least 20% compared with a traditional PF. Moreover, the proposed unsupervised k-means approach increases the accuracy by an additional 20%, whereas the overall performance of PFMK achieves a mean error of <1.5 m in the test environments.

Treatment requires timely in-take of medicines and strict adherence to routine. This lack of adherence is estimated to cause many deaths and hospitalizations. If we can get people to take their medications regularly, they won't develop complications. In addition to improving patient outcomes, medication adherence will reduce health care costs associated with these conditions. Healthcare monitoring solutions based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology has drawn significant research attention. This paper proposes an IoT based user configurable customized intelligent medicine kit augmented with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy technologies. It has capability to detect whether patient is taking all prescribed medicines on fix schedule and intelligently communicates the same to patient and their close relatives using uniquely created Four Tier Notification System (FTNS), thus helping patient to live a healthy life. The paper discusses a novel theme on the functioning of a medical grade device which would consume information from sensor and send it to the central server with a maximum possibility of success using Four Tier Notification System (FTNS). This novel approach discusses handshaking of connection to the central serve with a fallback mechanism to achieve maximum success of data synchronization. This paper also discusses how this useful data from medicine kit can help healthcare sector to closely track patient's physical activities and helps to influence the way healthcare sector operates in future.

J	Gupta, C; Varshney, G				Gupta, Chandranshu; Varshney, Gaurav			An improved authentication scheme for BLE devices with no I/O capabilities	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; Just Works; Authentication; Pairing; Internet of Things; Public Key Infrastructure; Elliptic curve cryptography; Energy consumption; Memory usage		Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices have become very popular because of their Low energy consumption and prolonged battery life. They are being used in smart wearable devices, home automation systems, beacons, and many more areas. BLE uses pairing mechanisms to achieve a level of peer entity authentication as well as encryption. Although there are a set of pairing mechanisms available, BLE devices with no keyboard or display mechanism (and hence using the Just Works pairing) are still vulnerable. In this paper, we propose and implement a light-weight digital certificate-based authentication mechanism for the BLE devices using the Just Works model. The proposed model is an add-on to the existing pairing mechanism and can be easily incorporated into the existing BLE stack. To counter the Man-in-The-Middle attack scenario in Just Works pairing (device spoofing), our proposed model allows the client and peripheral to use the popular Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to establish peer entity authentication and a secure cryptographic tunnel for communication. We have also developed a light-weight BLE profiled digital certificate containing the bare minimum fields required for resource-constrained devices, which significantly reduces the memory (about 90% reduction) and energy consumption. We have experimentally evaluated the device's energy consumption and execution time using the proposed pairing mechanism to demonstrate that the model can be easily deployed with fewer changes to the power requirements of the chips. The model has been formally verified using an automatic verification tool for protocol testing.

COVID-19 and Your Smartphone: BLE-Based Smart Contact Tracing	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Smart phones; Advertising; COVID-19; Protocols; Databases; Privacy; Infectious diseases; Bluetooth low energy; COVID-19; contact tracing; physical distancing; proximity; smartphone	PROXIMITY; BLUETOOTH; ACCURACY	While contact tracing is of paramount importance in preventing the spreading of infectious diseases, manual contact tracing is inefficient and time consuming as those in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days, later. This article proposes a smart contact tracing (SCT) system utilizing the smartphone's Bluetooth low energy signals and machine learning classifiers to automatically detect those possible contacts to infectious individuals. SCT's contribution is two-fold: a) classification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communication protocol. To protect the user's privacy, both broadcasted and observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone locally and only disseminate the stored signatures through a secure database when a user is confirmed by public health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength each smartphone estimates its distance from other user's phones and issues real-time alerts when social distancing rules are violated. Extensive experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative evaluation of five machine learning classifiers indicate that a decision tree classifier outperforms other state-of-the-art classification methods with an accuracy of about 90% when two users carry their smartphone in a similar manner. Finally, to facilitate research in this area while contributing to the timely development, the dataset of six experiments with about 123 000 data points is made publicly available.

Improving BLE Beacon Proximity Estimation Accuracy Through Bayesian Filtering	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Bayesian filter; Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon; iBeacons; Kalman filter (KF); nonparametric information (NI) filter; particle filter; proximity accuracy; proximity estimation	INDOOR LOCALIZATION; INTERNET; THINGS; MICROLOCATION	The interconnectedness of all things is continuously expanding which has allowed every individual to increase their level of interaction with their surroundings. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are used in a plethora of context-aware application, such as proximity-based services (PBSs), and location-based services (LBSs). For these systems to perform, it is essential to have reliable hardware and predict a user's position in the area with high accuracy in order to differentiate between individuals in a small area. A variety of wireless solutions that utilize received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) have been proposed to provide PBS and LBS for indoor environments, though each solution presents its own drawbacks. In this article, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons are examined in terms of their accuracy in proximity estimation. Specifically, a mobile application is developed along with three Bayesian filtering techniques to improve the BLE beacon proximity estimation accuracy. This includes a Kalman filter, a particle filter, and a nonparametric information (NI) filter. Since the RSSI is heavily influenced by the environment, experiments were conducted to examine the performance of beacons from three popular vendors in two different environments. The error is compared in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). According to the experimental results, Bayesian filters can improve proximity estimation accuracy up to 30% in comparison with traditional filtering, when the beacon and the receiver are within 3 m.

These insoles provide a new set of non-invasive tools that can be used either at the clinical installations or at home. That solution improves the usability and user experience compared with traditional tools (smart carpets, wired insoles, etc.) that are oriented to clinical installations. And hence, provide a powerful tool for Ambient Intelligent for Health, especially for elderly people, increasing their autonomy and providing means for long term monitoring. Health parameters analysed are fall risk and gait analysis. Both are assessed on the establishment of clinical parameters such as fall risk index, and gait pattern and fall detection and algorithms. All those can be obtained thanks to our fully-wireless flexible insole that contains the sensors, embedded processing and wireless communications and charging.

In an indoor localization field, a fingerprint method that compares the received signal strength (RSS) vector with the previously collected signal strength vector in a radio map is mostly applied. However, this method is dependent on the infrastructure around it and does not always provide stable performance owing to the severity of RSS noise in an indoor environment, which limits the application of this system. In this article, we propose an indoor positioning system using an accumulated RSS for mobile users. A user spatial RSS pattern is generated using the estimated user trajectory and the accumulated RSS. The user's trajectory is estimated using pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) technology. In particular, we proposed a novel concept, namely, a heading flag, to estimate a user's relative heading change in a certain period. The user's spatial RSS pattern can be generated using this flag even when the user performs various motions while walking. We developed our own Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and installed few beacons on a testbed for real-time positioning. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed system, we conducted a real field test in an office building. An average position estimation result of less than 2 m was obtained using the proposed system. It is expected that a commercial level location-based service (LBS) will be possible using the proposed system.

The proposed method of ePDR-BLE compensation mechanism (EPBCM) takes advantage of the non-requirement of linearization of the system around its current state in an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and Kalman filter (KF) in smoothing of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. In this paper, a fusion of conflicting information and the activity detection approach of an object in an indoor environment contemplates varying magnitude of accelerometer values based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). On the estimated orientation, the proposed approach remunerates the inadvertent body acceleration and magnetic distortion sensor data. Moreover, EPBCM can precisely calculate the velocity and position by reducing the position drift, which gives rise to a fault in zero-velocity and heading error. The developed EPBCM localization algorithm using Bluetooth low energy beacons (BLE) was applied and analyzed in an indoor environment. The experiments conducted in an indoor scenario shows the results of various activities performed by the object and achieves better orientation estimation, zero velocity measurements, and high position accuracy than other methods in the literature.

While its digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) runs directly at 0.5 V, an internal switched-capacitor dc-dc converter "doubles" the supply voltage to all the digital circuitry and particularly regulates the time-to-digital converter (TDC) supply to stabilize its resolution, thus maintaining fixed in-band phase noise (PN) across process, voltage, and temperature (PVT). The ADPLL supports a two-point modulation and forms a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transmitter realized in 28-nm CMOS. It maintains in-band PN of -106 dBc/Hz [figure of merit (FoM) of -239.2 dB] and rms jitter of 0.86 ps while dissipating only 1.6 mW at 40-MHz reference. The power consumption reduces to 0.8 mW during the BLE transmission when the DCO switches to open loop.

With existing infrastructures, wireless positioning is widely used to provide the location service. However, wireless positioning has the limitations such as highly depending on the distribution of access points (APs); providing a low sample-rate and noisy solution; requiring extensive labor costs to build databases; and having unstable RSS values in indoor environments. To reduce these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative integrated platform for indoor localization by integrating low-cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and wireless signals. This proposed platform consists of wireless AP localization engine and sensor fusion engine, which is suitable for both dense and sparse deployments of wireless APs. The proposed platform can automatically generate wireless databases for positioning, and provide a positioning solution even in the area with only one observed wireless AP, where the traditional trilateration method cannot work. This integration platform can integrate different kinds of wireless APs together for indoor localization (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth low energy, and radio frequency identification). The platform fuses all of these wireless distances with low-cost MEMS sensors to provide a robust localization solution. A multilevel quality control mechanism is utilized to remove noisy RSS measurements from wireless APs and to further improve the localization accuracy. Preliminary experiments show the proposed integration platform can achieve the average accuracy of 3.30 m with the sparse deployment of wireless APs (1 AP per 800 m(2)).

However, such relay nodes can be faulty or inactive due to various reasons, leading to interruptions of the communication link. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a novel security-enhanced emergency situation detection system, where 3(rd) party unknown mobile relays are used instead of dedicated gateways as opposed to many existing solutions for IoT healthcare applications. The proposed underlying key agreement and authentication scheme ensures anonymity and untraceability for both sensors (wearable devices) and relay nodes, and relies on symmetric key-based operations to function under resource-constrained environments. We have also developed a prototype of the system using commercial off-the-shelf devices to verify the proposed method's validity and evaluate the performance advantage over existing approaches. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication technology is used to connect sensor nodes (wearable devices) and mobile relays. After sending medical data to the cloud server, the relay node is responsible for emergency detection and alert generation.

The receiver (RX) employs a high-rate (up to 10 GS/s) discrete-time (DT) architecture with intermediate frequency (IF) placed beyond the 1/f noise corner of MOS devices. New multi-stage multi-rate charge-sharing bandpass filters are adapted to achieve high out-of-band linearity, low noise and low power consumption. A transmitter (TX) employs an all-digital PLL (ADPLL) with switched-current-source digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and switching PA. An integrated on-chip matching network serves both PA and LNTA, thus allowing a 1-pin direct antenna connection with no external antenna filters.

In this paper, we focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and IEEE 802.15.4 (CSMA, Low-power listening, and TSCH), and advocate low-power IPv6 for interoperability between the two. We perform a thorough experimental comparison of their link-layer performance, both in idle radio environment and when facing heavy (controlled) external interference.

Chronic diseases are indeed the main cause of hospitalization, especially for elderly people, leading to sustainability problems due to the huge amount of resources required. In the last years, the adoption of the chronic care model (CCM) as assistive model improved the management of these patients and reduced the related healthcare costs. The diffusion of wireless sensors, portable devices and connectivity enables to implement new information and communication technology (ICT)-based innovative applications to further improve the outcomes of the CCM. This paper presents a telemedicine platform for data acquisition, distribution, processing, presentation, and storage, aimed to remotely monitor the clinical status of chronic patients. The proposed solution is based on monitoring kits, with wireless Bluetooth (BT)/ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors and a gateway (i.e., smartphone or tablet) connected to a web-based cloud application that collects and makes available the clinical information to the medical staff. The platform allows clinicians and practitioners to monitor at distance their patients, according to personalized treatment plans, and to act promptly in case of aggravations, reducing hospitalizations and improving patients' quality of life.

However, constantly monitoring individual wellness has challenges due to the different and several activities people participate in throughout the day. The availability and popularity of low-cost and inexpensive Internet of Things (IoT) devices can alleviate this issue. In this work, an IoT framework is presented to examine the relationship between an individual's wellness and their surrounding environment. It uses an IoT device to collect data and forwards them using WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The participants in this study are two groups of ten undergraduate students at the University of Guelph. Each group took the experiment at different times of the year. Each participant is given an Android smartphone equipped with an application, in order to complete a brief psychological survey three times per day. During the periods of completion, an IoT device in their possession is reading environmental data. The five environmental variables collected are temperature, humidity, air pressure, luminosity, and noise level. Upon submission of the survey, the results of the survey and the environmental data are sent to a server via WiFi. According to experimental results, the first group to complete the experiment indicated a correlation between stress and noise, while the second group indicated a correlation between distress and light.

The RX leverages the constant-envelope nature of frequency shift keying modulation adopted in many IoT protocols, e.g., IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth low energy (BLE), to enhance the energy efficiency and to reduce the chip area. The proposed RX, with the DCO acting as a local oscillator (LO) and binary frequency feedback, promotes low-power and low-voltage circuit design, while a data-aided carrier-frequency tracking ensures the received carrier stability without a power-/area-hungry phase-locked loop (PLL). The RX avoids a compromise between a power-hungry I/Q LO generation and the image rejection in traditional RXs. An equivalent mathematical model is further presented, which helps to analyze and optimize the frequency response of the proposed RX. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, the RX consumes 1.55 mW from a 0.85-V supply and has a -87-dBm sensitivity at 2 Mb/s, which leads to a 0.77-nJ/b energy efficiency and 178-dB RX sensitivity FoM.

For example, the information if a room is unoccupied can be used for automatically switching off the light, air conditioning, and ventilation, thereby saving significant amounts of energy in public buildings. Most existing solutions rely on dedicated hardware installations, which involve presence sensors, video cameras, and carbon dioxide sensors. Unfortunately, such approaches are costly, subject to privacy concerns, have high computational requirements, and lack ubiquitousness. The work presented in this article addresses these limitations by proposing a low-cost occupancy detection system. Our approach builds upon detecting variations in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals related to the presence of humans. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by performing comprehensive tests on five different datasets. We apply several pattern recognition models and compare our methodology with systems building upon IEEE 802.11 (WiFi). On average, in multifarious environments, we can correctly classify the occupancy with an accuracy of 97.97%. When estimating the number of people in a room, on average, the estimated number of subjects differs from the actual one by 0.32 persons. We conclude that our system's performance is comparable to that of existing ones based on WiFi, while significantly reducing cost and installation effort. Hence, our approach makes occupancy detection practical for real-world deployments.

In order to achieve fast frequency calibration from modulated signals and reduce interference from other BLE users, the transceiver consists of a back-channel wake-up receiver, a clock-recovery receiver, a transmitter, and a dual-all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) frequency synthesizer for system wake-up, clock-recovery, packet transmission, and frequency calibration. An embedded averaging processing unit in the loop filter of the ADPLL is proposed to retrieve accurate frequency information from GFSK-modulated signals. A prototype chip is fabricated in 40-nm CMOS for verification. The crystal-less transmitter with clock recovery meets all BLE requirements for SIR, making this a robust solution for removing the crystal even in densely populated networks.

Several research studies reveal that one of the disadvantages of conventional, battery-powered WSNs, however, is that they typically require periodic maintenance. This paper aims to contribute to existing research studies on this issue by exploring a new energy-autonomous and battery-free WSN concept for monitor vibrations. The node is self-powered from the conversion of ambient mechanical vibration energy into electrical energy through a piezoelectric transducer implemented with lead-free lithium niobate piezoelectric material to also explore solutions that go towards a greener and more sustainable IoT. Instead of implementing any particular sensors, the vibration measurement system exploits the proportionality between the mechanical power generated by a piezoelectric transducer and the time taken to store it as electrical energy in a capacitor. This helps reduce the component count with respect to conventional WSNs, as well as energy consumption and production costs, while optimizing the overall node size and weight. The readout is therefore a function of the time it takes for the energy storage capacitor to charge between two constant voltage levels. The result of this work is a system that includes a specially designed lead-free piezoelectric vibrational transducer and a battery-less sensor platform with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) connectivity. The system can harvest energy in the acceleration range [0.5 g-1.2 g] and measure vibrations with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.6 g.

Framework of Automated Construction-Safety Monitoring Using Cloud-Enabled BIM and BLE Mobile Tracking Sensors	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE); Building information model (BIM); Construction safety; Cloud computing; Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Safety monitoring; Information technologies	HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Construction sites need to be monitored continuously to detect unsafe conditions and protect workers from potential injuries and fatal accidents. In current practices, construction-safety monitoring relies heavily on manual observation, which is labor-intensive and errorprone. Due to the complex environment of construction sites, it is extremely challenging for safety inspectors to continuously monitor and manually identify all incidents that may expose workers to safety risks. There exist many research efforts applying sensing technologies to construction sites to reduce the manual efforts associated with construction-safety monitoring. However, several bottlenecks are identified in applying these technologies to the onsite safety monitoring process, including (1) recognition and registration of potential hazards, (2) realtime detection of unsafe incidents, and (3) reporting and sharing of the detected incidents with relevant participants in a timely manner. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a low-cost automated safety monitoring system to assist in the construction-safety monitoring process. This paper presents a framework for this safety monitoring system as a cloud-based real time on-site application. The system integrates Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-based location detection technology, building information model (BIM)-based hazard identification, and a cloud-based communication platform. Potential unsafe areas are defined automatically or manually in a BIM model. Real-time worker locations are acquired to detect incidents where workers are exposed to predefined risks. Then, the safety monitoring results are instantly communicated over the cloud for effective safety management. Through a real-world construction site case study, the system successfully demonstrated the capability to detect unsafe conditions and collect and analyze the trajectories of workers with respect to potential safety hazards.

Since the spreading probability of the novel coronavirus in indoor environments is much higher than that of the outdoors, there is an urgent and unmet quest to develop/design efficient, autonomous, trustworthy, and secure indoor CT solutions. Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. This article addresses this gap and proposes the trustworthy blockchain-enabled system for an indoor CT (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed to protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized access. More specifically, it is a fully distributed and innovative blockchain platform exploiting the proposed dynamic Proof-of-Work (dPoW) credit-based consensus algorithm coupled with randomized hash window (W-Hash) and dynamic Proof-of-Credit (dPoC) mechanisms to differentiate between honest and dishonest nodes. The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but also quantifies the node's behavior based on its underlying credit-based mechanism. For achieving a high localization performance, we capitalize on the availability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures, and develop a data-driven localization model based on bluetooth low-energy (BLE) sensor measurements. The simulation results show that the proposed TB-ICT prevents the COVID-19 from spreading by the implementation of a highly accurate CT model while improving the users' privacy and security.

The remote monitoring of patients through a wearable sensing network has outstanding potential in current healthcare systems. Such a network can continuously monitor the vital health conditions (such as heart rate variability, blood pressure, glucose level, and oxygen saturation) of patients with chronic diseases. Low-power radio-frequency (RF) technologies, especially Bluetooth low energy (BLE), play significant roles in modern healthcare. However, most of the RF spectrum is licensed and regulated, and the effect of RF on human health is of major concern. Moreover, the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio in high distance can be decreased to a considerable extent, possibly leading to the increase in bit-error rate. Optical camera communication (OCC), which uses a camera to receive data from a light-emitting diode (LED), can be utilized in eHealth to mitigate the limitations of RF. However, OCC also has several limitations, such as high signal-blockage probability. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid OCC/BLE system is proposed to ensure efficient, remote, and real-time transmission of a patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to a monitor. First, a patch circuit integrating an LED array and BLE transmitter chip is proposed. The patch collects the ECG data according to the health condition of the patient to minimize power consumption. Second, a network selection algorithm is developed for a new network access request generated in the patch circuit. Third, fuzzy logic is employed to select an appropriate camera for data reception. Fourth, a handover mechanism is suggested to ensure efficient network allocation considering the patient's mobility. Finally, simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance and reliability of the proposed system.	[Hasan, Moh.

Nevertheless, new low-power solutions are still needed for enabling long-term, comfortable, and lightweight monitoring systems. This article deals with electroencephalography (EEG)-over-Bluetooth low energy (BLE), a novel architecture for multichannel EEG, characterized by low power consumption. The proposed architecture relies on a low-power analog front-end (AFE) for EEG signals and a system-on-chip (SoC) that supports the Bluetooth 5.0 protocol. Moreover, a near-lossless EEG compression algorithm and a simple channel encoding scheme are introduced in the proposed architecture to reduce energy consumption and improve network performance. Detailed investigations were carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture. In particular, simulation results and an analytical model on power consumption reported in this article show that, when commercial small-form-factor batteries are used for power supply, the lifetime of a 64-channel EEG-over-BLE monitoring system is over 86 days. Moreover, the proposed architecture is highly reliable, achieving a packet loss rate (PLR) lower than 0.1% and a latency below 35 ms, which is compliant with ISO/IEEE 11073 standard for medical device communications.

However, to maintain compatibility with BLE 4.0, this coding is not permitted, limiting the range of these networks.

Delivery vehicles are part of both problems, because of their intensive use, the advent of e-commerce, the limited number and sizes of loading and unloading areas in many ancient European cities, and the difficulties associated to keep track of the correct use of these spaces. In this work we propose an holistic solution to the management of delivery vehicles in urban environments. Our solution, called RYDER, is based on the use of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices that should be provided by the local authority to delivery vehicles, as part of their authorization to use the loading and unloading areas. With the help of low-cost, low-power antennas with Bluetooth and 4G capabilities installed next to each loading/unloading area, the authorities are able to know in real time (a) the use of these areas by delivery vehicles, (b) the paths of the vehicles while they travel across the city, (c) the time spent in each area by each one of them, and (d) with the help of a mobile/tablet App, the local Police can check in seconds the permissions of each vehicle using these public spaces. Moreover, the use of a GIS-based platform allows the Traffic Department to track online each particular vehicle, based on the loading/unloading spaces being used, and to infer the most representative paths they follow, an information that may guide the decision about where these spaces are really necessary and whether each particular vehicle follows their associated usage rules. The deployment of RYDER low-cost antennas can also serve for other purposes, such as to track the routes followed by public loan bicycles, or by other fleets of public vehicles. With the help of low-cost sensors, antennas can also return an estimation of pollution values, such as levels of ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide, among others.

A Regulation-Free Sub-0.5-V 16-/24-MHz Crystal Oscillator With 14.2-nJ Startup Energy and 31.8-mu W Steady-State Power	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); chirping; CMOS; crystal oscillator (XO); duty-cycling; energy harvesting (EH); fast startup; Internet-of-Things (IoT); ultralow power (ULP); ultralow voltage (ULV)	CMOS; DESIGN; SYSTEM; SOLAR	This paper reports a regulation-free sub-0.5-V crystal oscillator (XO). The XO specifically designed for Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radios aims for direct-powering by the harvested energy. To secure its performance against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, while reducing its startup time and energy, we propose a dual-mode g(m) scheme and a scalable self-reference chirp injection (SSCI) technique. The former employs an inductive multistage g(m) to mitigate the crystal's stray capacitance during the startup, but a single-stage g(m) in the steady state to preserve the phase noise (PN). For the latter (SSCI), we generate a scalable chirping sequence to kick-start the XO, avoiding trimming of the auxiliary oscillator. The XO fabricated in 65-nm CMOS is measured with two common crystals (16/24 MHz) over a 0.3-to-0.5-V supply. At 24 MHz and 0.35 V, the startup time and energy of the XO are 400 mu s and 14.2 nJ, respectively, while showing a steady-state power of 31.8 mu W and a PN of -134 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset. The frequency stability is 14.1 ppm against temperature (-40 degrees C-90 degrees C) and 17.9 ppm against voltage (0.3-0.5 V), both conform to the BLE standard (+/- 50 ppm) with adequate margin.

There are instances where students are unaware of assignment deadlines and tests which lead to demeaning scores. To bridge this gap, Internet of Things (IOT) can be used to provide academic related information to students. This functionality would help in achieving the goal of zero verbal communication between student and teacher. The teacher can upload assignments and deadlines which will be retrieved by the mobile phone when the student comes in the range of the device. To accomplish this goal, we used Beacon technology which allows Mobile Applications to listen for signals from beacons in the physical world and react accordingly.

The energy consumption and discovery latency of this procedure are determined by the parametrization of the protocol. In most existing protocols, reception and transmission are temporally coupled. Such schemes are referred to as slotted, for which the problem of finding optimized parametrizations has been studied thoroughly in the literature. However, slotted approaches are not efficient in applications in which new devices join the network gradually and only the joining devices and a master node need to run the ND protocol simultaneously. For example, this is typically the case in IoT scenarios or bluetooth low energy (BLE) piconets. Here, slotless protocols that decouple reception and transmission can achieve significantly lower worst-case latencies than slotted ones. In this paper, we study slotless, BLE-like protocols, which schedule receptions and transmissions independently using periodic intervals (PI). For this class of protocols, optimal parameter values remain unknown. To address this, we propose an optimization framework for PI-based protocols, which translates any specified duty-cycle (and therefore energy budget) into a set of optimized parameter values. We show that the parametrizations resulting from one variant of our proposed scheme are optimal when one receiver discovers one transmitter, and no other parametrization or ND protocol - neither slotted nor slotless - can guarantee lower discovery latencies for a given duty-cycle in this scenario. Since the resulting protocol utilizes the channel more aggressively than other ND protocols, beacons will collide more frequently. Hence, due to collisions, the rate of successful discoveries gracefully decreases for larger numbers of devices discovering each other simultaneously. We also propose a scheme for configuring the BLE protocol (and not just BLE-like protocols). Though it is not clear whether the resulting parametrizations minimize the latencies of BLE, reasonably low worst-case latencies can be guaranteed.

To compare all technologies on an equal basis, we have developed an analyzer that computes the energy consumption for a given protocol based on the power required in a given state (Sleep, Idle, Tx, and Rx) and the duration of each state. We consider the case of an energy constrained node that uploads data to a sink, analyzing the physical (PHY) layer under medium access control (MAC) constraints, and assuming IPv6 traffic whenever possible. This paper considers the energy spent in retransmissions due to corrupted frames and collisions as well as the impact of imperfect clocks. The comparison shows that the BLE offers the best lifetime for all traffic intensities in its capacity range. LoRa achieves long lifetimes behind 802.15.4 and BLE for ultra low traffic intensity; SIGFOX only matches LoRa for very small data sizes. Moreover, considering the energy consumption due to retransmissions of lost data packets only decreases the lifetimes without changing their relative ranking. We believe that these comparisons will give all users of IoT technologies indications about the technology that bestfits their needs from the energy consumption point of view. Our analyzer will also help IoT network designers to select the right MAC parameters to optimize the energy consumption for a given application.

Therefore, we propose to define membership functions based on the distribution of RSS with a technique of fuzzy logic; specifically, a fuzzy rule is defined with offline data.

J	Einavipour, S; Javidan, R				Einavipour, Sina; Javidan, Reza			An intelligent IoT-based positioning system for theme parks	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Positioning systems; Fuzzy logic; Bluetooth low energy; Ant colony optimization; Theme parks; Meta-heuristic algorithms; Internet of things (IoT)	OPTIMAL LAYOUT; LOCALIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; TRACKING; BEACONS	With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous presence of sensor nodes, positioning technologies have become a topic of interest among researchers. While the applications of positioning systems are very vast, determining the position of moving sensor nodes, finding missing people in large areas, and object tracking are among the most popular ones. The focus of this paper is to propose a positioning system to locate missing people in theme parks. Currently, radio frequency identification (RFID) systems are used in modern theme parks to locate lost visitors. In these systems, a wristband with active RFID tag is given to each visitor and RFID readers are deployed in predetermined locations. When a visitor is in the communication range of a reader, its location can be estimated based on the location of the reader. Therefore, the accuracy of these systems is relevant to the communication range of readers. Another limitation of RFID-based systems is due to the fact that readers cannot be placed in communication range of each other as they can interference with each other. It is clear that the only way to increase the accuracy of such systems is by increasing the number of readers and decreasing the communication range of each reader. In this paper, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based system is proposed to be used in theme parks for locating lost visitors. The advantage of using BLE is due to the fact that it uses frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) thus readers can be placed in communication range of each other without severe interference. In the proposed method, at first, the optimal places for deploying readers are obtained using ant colony optimization (ACO). Then, a fuzzy approach is used to increase the accuracy of the system. Three different signal levels are defined to be used in our fuzzy system based on which the location of visitors can be estimated. By using three levels of signal strength, the accuracy of the system is increased compared with the similar system with the similar number of readers. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the system is improved using this method, and the cost of the system is decreased as BLE readers are much less expensive than their RFID counterparts.

Under this context, this work focuses on the effect of the body posture for the purpose of detecting a face-to-face interactions between individuals. To this purpose, we describe the NESTORE sensing kit that we used to collect a significant dataset that mimics some common postures of subjects while interacting. Our experimental results distinguish clearly those postures that negatively affect the quality of the signals used for detecting an interactions, from those postures that do not have such a negative impact. We also show the performance of the SID (Social Interaction Detector) algorithm with different settings, and we present its performance in terms of accuracy during the classification of interaction and non-interaction events.

In this paper, we present an algorithm with the corresponding smartphone app that enables users to calculate their locations based on representative infrastructures, such as nearby Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons subject to low-cost, rapid system deployment, and competitive location accuracy. Working under indoor multiple-floor scenarios, our app has three prominent features for estimating user locations. First, we establish a feature identifier to detect the current floor and the feasible area in which the user may walk. Second, owing to the structures of the indoor environment and the presence of different obstacles, the unpredictable variation of the received signal strength (RSS) in indoor environments is considered in the RSS-distance relationship to provide accurate location estimates. Third, with the prevalence of smartphones, we extract smartphone-inertial measurement units to learn users' behavior preferences, while collecting reference signals (e.g., Wi-Fi/BLE readings) along the pathway and input to the tracking algorithm. Then, the user's current location is displayed on the app. With this solution, we can provide an accurate location estimate with relatively low computational complexity regarding mobile device capability, while reducing labor costs from traditional fingerprint deployments. Finally, we test our tracking app in real-time multiple floor scenarios and evaluate the collected tracking data. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves an average localization accuracy of more than 80% within a 2-m error bound in multiple-floor scenarios, while all areas (i.e., corridors, rooms, and stairs) were successfully identified.

Identifying the BLE Advertising Channel for Reliable Distance Estimation on Smartphones	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Smart phones; Estimation; Channel estimation; Advertising; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor networks; Bluetooth; Bluetooth; bluetooth low energy; BLE; channel detection; contact tracing; neighbor discovery; distance estimation; smartphone; android	BLUETOOTH; PROPAGATION; PERFORMANCE; PROXIMITY	Estimating the distance between two smartphones plays an important role in a host of applications. For this purpose, smartphones emit and scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. When a device is detected, the distance is estimated by evaluating the received strength of these signals. The main insight that is exploited for distance estimation is that the attenuation of a signal increases with the distance along which it has traveled. However, besides distance, there are multiple additional factors that impact the attenuation and hence disturb the distance estimation procedure. Among them, frequency-selective hardware and signal propagation belong to the most significant ones. For example, a BLE device transmits packets on three different frequencies (channels), while the transmit power and the receiver sensitivity depend on the frequency. As a result, the received signal strength varies for each channel, even when the distance remains constant. However, the information on which wireless channel a packet has been received is not made available to a smartphone. Hence, this error cannot be compensated, e.g. by calibration. In this paper, we for the first time provide a solution to detect the wireless channel on which a packet has been received by a smartphone application. We experimentally evaluate our proposed technique on multiple different smartphone models. Our results help to make distance estimation on smartphones more robust and accurate.

To meet the demand for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that require a large number of maintenance-free, low cost, wireless sensor nodes, this paper proposes a wireless sensor platform with a single photovoltaic transducer that performs the dual role of harvesting energy and sensing ambient light. This dual use allows even smaller and cheaper nodes that do not require any form of supporting external power, with a reduced component count. The device implements off-the-shelf components on a 2x2cm(2) printed circuit board (PCB) with a thickness of 0.45cm. It features Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication and can harvest and sense indoor ambient light with a limit of detection of 200 lux.

The availability of ubiquitous devices such as wearable sensors has enabled researchers to collect voluminous datasets and harness them in a wide range of health care topics. One of the goals of using on-body wearable sensors has been to study and analyze human activity and functional patterns, thereby predicting harmful outcomes such as falls. It can also be used to track precise individual movements to form personalized behavioral patterns, to standardize the concept of frailty, well-being/independence, etc. Most wearable devices such as activity trackers and smartwatches are equipped with low-cost embedded sensors that can provide users with health statistics. In addition to wearable devices, Bluetooth low-energy sensors known as BLE beacons have gained traction among researchers in ambient intelligence domain. The low cost and durability of newer versions have made BLE beacons feasible gadgets to yield indoor localization data, an adjunct feature in human activity recognition. In the studies by Moatamed et al and the patent application by Ramezani et al, we introduced a generic framework (Sensing At-Risk Population) that draws on the classification of human movements using a 3-axial accelerometer and extracting indoor localization using BLE beacons, in concert. Objective: The study aimed to examine the ability of combination of physical activity and indoor location features, extracted at baseline, on a cohort of 154 rehabilitation-dwelling patients to discriminate between subacute care patients who are re-admitted to the hospital versus the patients who are able to stay in a community setting. Methods: We analyzed physical activity sensor features to assess activity time and intensity. We also analyzed activities with regard to indoor localization. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare demographic variables and sensor feature variables in outcome groups. Random forests were used to build predictive models based on the most significant features. Results: Standing time percentage (P<. 001, d= 1.51), laying down time percentage (P<. 001, d= 1.35), resident room energy intensity (P<. 001, d= 1.25), resident bed energy intensity (P<. 001, d= 1.23), and energy percentage of active state (P=. 001, d= 1.24) are the 5 most statistically significant features in distinguishing outcome groups at baseline. The energy intensity of the resident intensity of the resident room, as a standalone attribute, is the most sensitive parameter in the identification of outcome groups (area under the curve=0.84). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a combination of indoor localization and physical activity tracking produces a series of features at baseline, a subset of which can better distinguish between at-risk patients that can gain independence versus the patients that are rehospitalized.

Combining balun, low-noise amplifier (LNA), mixer, and oscillator in a single stage, the proposed circuit, named the Blixator, is well suited for low-power applications. The baseband's transimpedance amplifier (TIA) also shares part of its dc current with the Blixator cell, resulting in sub-milliwatt power consumption. To avoid additional power and area by quadrature LO generation, the I/Q signals are generated at RF, employing the inductors already required for providing the dc current path of the LNA transistors. The expressions for gain, noise figure (NF), and phase noise of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) are derived, and the behavior of the circuit is thoroughly investigated. The prototype of the Blixator receiver is implemented in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. The experimental results show a NF of 10.5 dB, an IIP3 of -15.5 dBm, at the maximum gain, and an image rejection of 23 dB, which meets the requirements for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard. The circuit consumes only 340-mu W, from a 0.8-V supply, and its die area is 0.75 mm(2).

In this article, an indoor localization system is presented, to enhance the user experience in a museum. In particular, the proposed system relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons proximity and localization capabilities to automatically provide the users with cultural contents related to the observed artworks. At the same time, a received signal strength-based technique is used to estimate the location of the visitor in the museum. An Android application is developed to estimate the distance from the exhibits and collect useful analytics regarding each visit and provide a recommendation to the users. Moreover, the application implements a simple Kalman filter in the smartphone, without the need of the cloud, to improve localization, precision and accuracy. Experimental results on distance estimation, location, and detection accuracy show that BLE beacon is a promising solution for an interactive smart museum. The proposed system has been designed to be easily extensible to the IoT technologies and its effectiveness has been evaluated through experimentation.

However, indoor localization systems based on a single technology still have their limitations, such as the drift of inertial navigation and the received signal strength fluctuation of Bluetooth, making them unable to provide reliable positioning. To exploit the complementary strengths of each technology, this paper proposes a feasible fusion framework by utilizing a particle filter to integrate data-driven inertial navigation with localization based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). For data-driven inertial navigation, under the premise of using the deep neural network with great potential in model-free generalization to regress pedestrian motion characteristics, we effectively combined the method of using gravity to stabilize inertial measurement units data to make the network more robust. Experimental results show that in the test of different smartphone usages, the proposed data-driven inertial navigation and BLE-based localization technology have good results in modeling user's movement and positioning respectively. And due to this, the proposed fusion algorithm has almost unaffected by the usages of smartphones. Compared with BLE-based localization that achieved a good mean positional error (MPE) of 1.76m, for the four usages of texting, swinging, calling and pocket, the proposed fusion algorithm reduced the MPE by 32.35%, 20.51%, 20.74%, and 45.37%, respectively, and can further improve localization accuracy on the basis of existing fusion method.

This investigation focuses on the hardware/software co-design for optimized sensing and computing of wearable HAR sensor networks. The contributions include (1) design of a miniature wearable sensor node integrating a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System Inertial Measurement Unit (MEMS IMU) with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in-built Micro-Control Unit (MCU) for unobtrusive wearable sensing; (2) task-centric optimization of the computation by shifting data pre-processing and feature extraction to sensor nodes for in-situ computing, which reduces data transmission and relieves the load of the host machine; (3) optimization and evaluation of classification algorithms Particle Swarm Optimization-based Support Vector Machine (PSO-SVM) and Cross Validation-based K-Nearest Neighbors (CV-KNN) for HAR with the presented techniques. Finally, experimental studies were conducted with two sensor nodes worn on the wrist and elbow to verify the effectiveness of the recognition of 10 virtual handwriting activities, where 10 recruited participants each repeated an activity 5 times. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can implement HAR tasks effectively with an accuracy of 99.20 %.

The algorithm powering the positioning system requires previous calibration, which comes to be a tedious and long invasive process when it is accomplished in a space with high people flow.

Fuzzy Guided Autonomous Nursing Robot through Wireless Beacon Network	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Robotics; Smart hospital; Ultrasonic sensor; Fuzzy logic; Bluetooth low energy beacon; Raspberry pi; Wireless beacon network		Robotics is one of the most emerging technologies today, and are used in a variety of applications, ranging from complex rocket technology to monitoring of crops in agriculture. Robots can be exceptionally useful in a smart hospital environment provided that they are equipped with improved vision capabilities for detection and avoidance of obstacles present in their path, thus allowing robots to perform their tasks without any disturbance. In the particular case of Autonomous Nursing Robots, major essential issues are effective robot path planning for the delivery of medicines to patients, measuring the patient body parameters through sensors, interacting with and informing the patient, by means of voice-based modules, about the doctors visiting schedule, his/her body parameter details, etc. This paper presents an approach of a complete Autonomous Nursing Robot which supports all the aforementioned tasks. In this paper, we present a new Autonomous Nursing Robot system capable of operating in a smart hospital environment area. The objective of the system is to identify the patient room, perform robot path planning for the delivery of medicines to a patient, and measure the patient body parameters, through a wireless BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacon receiver and the BLE beacon transmitter at the respective patient rooms. Assuming that a wireless beacon is kept at the patient room, the robot follows the beacon's signal, identifies the respective room and delivers the needed medicine to the patient. A new fuzzy controller system which consists of three ultrasonic sensors and one camera is developed to detect the optimal robot path and to avoid the robot collision with stable and moving obstacles. The fuzzy controller effectively detects obstacles in the robot's vicinity and makes proper decisions for avoiding them. The navigation of the robot is implemented on a BLE tag module by using the AOA (Angle of Arrival) method. The robot uses sensors to measure the patient body parameters and updates these data to the hospital patient database system in a private cloud mode. It also makes uses of a Google assistant to interact with the patients. The robotic system was implemented on the Raspberry Pi using Matlab 2018b. The system performance was evaluated on a PC with an Intel Core i5 processor, while the solar power was used to power the system. Several sensors, namely HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, Logitech HD 720p image sensor, a temperature sensor and a heart rate sensor are used together with a camera to generate datasets for testing the proposed system. In particular, the system was tested on operations taking place in the context of a private hospital in Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. A detailed comparison is performed, through some performance metrics, such as Correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), against the related works of Deepu et al., Huh and Seo, Chinmayi et al., Alli et al., Xu, Ran et al., and Lee et al. The experimental system validation showed that the fuzzy controller achieves very high accuracy in obstacle detection and avoidance, with a very low computational time for taking directional decisions. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrated that the robotic system achieves superior accuracy in detecting/avoiding obstacles compared to other systems of similar purposes presented in the related works.

The data was gathered during Amsterdam Dance Event 2016 in an exclusive club experience curated around human senses, which leveraged technology as a bridge between the club and the guests. Each guest was handed a custom-made wristband with a BLE-enabled device that broadcast movement; temperature and other sensor readings. A network of Raspberry Pi receivers deployed for the occasion captured broadcast packets from wristbands and any other BLE device in the environment. This data provides a full picture of the performance of the real life deployment of a sensing infrastructure and gives insights to designing sensing platforms, understanding networks and crowds behaviour or studying opportunistic sensing. This paper describes an analysis of this dataset and seine examples of usage.

The receiver (RX) fabricated in a 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) process achieves a sensitivity of -96.4 dBm, an intermodulation tolerance of -27 dBm for interferers at 6- and 12-MHz offsets, while consuming 1.9 mW. An RX-chain with a gain-programmable low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) provides good linearity over a wide input power range. The LNTA changes amplifier topology according to the gain setting. It achieves a gain range of 41 dB and the IIP3 of -13 dBm at maximum gain.

In Taiwan, 51.9 percent of the elderly over 45 years old need rehabilitation and the demand of wearing orthoses aids in the aging of society has increased significantly. Physicians don't know the rehabilitation effectiveness and the patient compliance behaviors and related factors of the disease until the patients come back to the clinic. It will affect the diagnosis accuracy. In Taiwan, there isn't a continuous spin care after a patient goes to clinic. Therefore, in the study, we cooperate with orthopedics department of Mackay Memorial Hospital Hsinchu Branch to plan a continuous spin care service based on an iBrace monitor system with BLE (Blue Low Energy). iBrace integrates EMG, pressure sensors and position sensors and APP with cloud spine care service platform.

The use of BLE beacons offers a straightforward approach to broadcast information to any device being in the coverage zone and able to process such signal. Instead of this static solution, in this paper, we face an alternative approach that, combining both Wi-Fi and BLE beacon technologies, is able to dynamically adapt the information being broadcast depending on the particular devices in the coverage area. Taking advantage of the beacon device communications, we propose to monitor the space occupancy throughout the study area (typically inside a building) by following the beacon device data exchange. This information would be later used to improve space analysis. As a proof of concept, we have conducted an experiment inside a faculty to check the potentiality of the proposal, obtaining promising results.

The system comprising readout electronics for a high-density resistive sensor array and a rechargeable battery, was realized in a wristband. The analyzed data with the proposed system can be visualized using a custom graphical user interface (GUI) developed in a personal computer (PC) through a universal serial bus (USB) and using an Android app in smartphones via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), respectively. The readout electronics were implemented on a printed circuit board (PCB) and had a compact dimension of 3 cm x 3 cm. It was designed to measure the resistive sensor with a dynamic range of 1 K ohm-1 M ohm and detect a 0.1% change of the base resistance. The system operated at a 5 V supply voltage, and the overall system power consumption was 95 mW. The readout circuit employed a resistance-to-voltage (R-V) conversion topology using a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), integrated in the Cypress Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC(R)) 5LP microcontroller. The device behaves as a universal-type sensing system that can be interfaced with a wide variety of resistive sensors, including chemiresistors, piezoresistors, and thermoelectric sensors, whose resistance variations fall in the target measurement range of 1 K ohm-1 M ohm. The system performance was tested with a 60-resistor array and showed a satisfactory accuracy, with a worst-case error rate up to 2.5%. The developed sensing system shows promising results for applications in the field of the Internet of things (IoT), point-of-care testing (PoCT), and low-cost wearable devices.

Creating and applying these systems requires decisions about measuring and transmitting signals, the algorithm transforming signals into position estimations as well as the representation displayed to the user. One approach gaining significance recently in this context are Mesh Networks. A Mesh Network enables single nodes to exchange information with other nodes directly and dynamically, increases the error-tolerance, and facilitates the setup by reducing installation overhead. This paper studies the applicability of Bluetooth Mesh Networking technology for ILS by means of an experimental setup. The quality of localization is evaluated depending on different inference approaches as well as the scalability of the Bluetooth Mesh Technology. As initial results show, ILS based on Bluetooth Mesh Networks provide similar results regarding the accuracy of localization compared to other underlying technologies, such as Wi-Fi mesh networks, and can be set up with lower effort and costs. However, the underlying Bluetooth technology limits the scalability of the mesh network, especially in case of permanent localization of nodes.

Providing a large amount of training data is not always feasible; therefore, we need to consider alternative ways that incorporate unlabeled data as well. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success in several application domains. It is an applicable method for IoT and smart city scenarios where auto-generated data can be partially labeled by users' feedback for training purposes. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised DRL model that fits smart city applications as it consumes both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance and accuracy of the learning agent. The model utilizes variational autoencoders as the inference engine for generalizing optimal policies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first investigation that extends DRL to the semisupervised paradigm. As a case study of smart city applications, we focus on smart buildings and apply the proposed model to the problem of indoor localization based on Bluetooth low energy signal strength. Indoor localization is the main component of smart city services since people spend significant time in indoor environments. Our model learns the best action policies that lead to a close estimation of the target locations with an improvement of 23% in terms of distance to the target and at least 67% more received rewards compared to the supervised DRL model.

To ensure that the proposed low power transceiver can operate at 1 Mbps data rate, FSK modulation is implemented using an ADPLL with direct modulation technique. The SPDT switch is integrated to share the antenna and matching network between the transmitter and receiver, thus minimizing the system cost by reducing external components. The transceiver is implemented using 1P6M 55-nm CMOS technology. The die area of the transceiver with DC-DC converter is 1.79 mm(2). The power consumption of the Tx and Rx are 6 and 5 mW, respectively. The noise figure of Rx is up to 6.8 dB with respect to channel frequencies. The phase noise of the ADPLL is -84.7 and -118.9 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz and 1 MHz offset from 2.44 GHz, respectively.

An Ultra-Low-Voltage Single-Crystal Oscillator-Timer (XO-Timer) Delivering 16-MHz and 32.258-kHz Clocks for Sub-0.5-V Energy-Harvesting BLE Radios in 28-nm CMOS	IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); clock; CMOS; crystal oscillator-timer (XO-Timer); energy harvesting; Internet-of-Things (IoT); micropower manager (mu PM); ultra-low-power (ULP); ultra-low-voltage (ULV)	START-UP; POWER	This paper reports an ultra-low-voltage (ULV) single-crystal oscillator-timer (XO-Timer) for sub-0.5 V Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radios that aims for self-powering by harvesting the ambient energies. Specifically, we tailor an on-chip micropower manager (mu PM) to customize the voltage and current budgets for each sub-function of the XO-Timer. Such mu PM shows a high power efficiency by introducing a 3-stage cascaded structure and a single voltage-regulation loop; they together uphold the performance of the XO-Timer amid supply-voltage and temperature variations. The core amplifier of the XO-Timer is ULV-enabled, and is reconfigurable (i.e., 1-stage and 3-stage gm) to balance between the power budget and performance under the high-performance mode (HPM) and low-power mode (LPM). Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the XO-Timer in HPM generates a 16-MHz clock with a power of 24.3 mu W, and a phase noise of -133.8 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset, resulting in a Figure-of-Merit (FoM(1)) of -236 dBc/Hz. In the LPM, the XO-Timer delivers a 32.258-kHz clock while consuming 11.4 mu W. The sleep-timer FoM(2) is 14.8 mu W and the Allan deviation is 35.1 ppb, achieving the lowest supply voltage (0.25 V) not only for a dual-mode XO-Timer but also for a MHz-range XO.

A 0.2-V Energy-Harvesting BLE Transmitter With a Micropower Manager Achieving 25% System Efficiency at 0-dBm Output and 5.2-nW Sleep Power in 28-nm CMOS	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE); CMOS; energy harvesting; master-slave sampling filter (MSSF); micropower manager (mu PM); phase-locked loop (PLL); power amplifier (PA); power gating; transmitter (TX); ultralow-voltage (ULV); voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO)		This paper reports an ultralow-voltage (ULV) energy-harvesting bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transmitter (TX). It features: 1) a fully integrated micropower manager (mu PM) to customize the internal supply and bias voltages for both active and sleep modes; 2) a gate-to-source-coupling ULV voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) using a high-ratio (5.6:1) stacking transformer to improve the phase noise and output swing; 3) an ULV class-E/F-2 power amplifier (PA) with an inside-transformer LC notch to suppress the HD3, and finally 4) an analog type-I phase-locked loop (PLL) with a reduced duty cycle of its master slave sampling filter (MSSF) to suppress the jitter and reference spur. The TX prototyped in 28-nm CMOS occupies an active area of 0.53 mm(2) and exhibits 25% system efficiency at 0-dBm output at a single 0.2-V supply. Without resorting from any external components, both the output HD2 (-49.6 dBm) and HD3 (-47.4 dBm) comply with the BLE standard. The FSK error is 2.84% and the frequency drift in a 425-mu s data packet is <5 kHz under open-loop modulation. The use of negative-voltage power gating suppresses the sleep power of the entire TX to 5.2 nW.

Despite the abundance of available technologies to mute notifications, they all require a direct action from their users, thus potentially causing users to forget, or even neglect, to set their phones to silent mode. This article proposes an innovative, novel solution to this issue by implementing an environment with a predetermined perimeter known as the "quiet zone." The Implementation of a Quiet Zone (IoQZ) employs the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) by utilizing unique transmitters known as Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacons, which indicate that a smartphone has entered the proximity of a quiet zone. And in turn, the smartphone will dynamically interact with the beacon so that it automatically sets itself to silent mode in a quiet zone, and back to the previous mode setting once its user leaves the quiet zone range. Therefore, this method does not require any direct intervention from the user in order to mute notifications. The proposed solution is original and was developed, implemented, and tested in a real-world workplace. The results showed that this concept is valid, effective, and accurate. The solution also yields opportunities, features, and applications that can be studied and extended upon as future work.

J	Ye, HY; Yang, B; Long, ZQ; Dai, CH				Ye, Hongyun; Yang, Biao; Long, Zhiqiang; Dai, Chunhui			A Method of Indoor Positioning by Signal Fitting and PDDA Algorithm Using BLE AOA Device	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Receiving antennas; Transmitters; Linear antenna arrays; Bluetooth; Arrays; Mathematical models; Switches; Bluetooth low energy; angle of arrival; constant tone extension; frequency deviation; PDDA algorithm; positioning accuracy	LOCATION	Though Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has been pretty mature and widely used in our daily life, the positioning of the indoor environment cannot be realized due to the shielding of concretes or glasses by GNSS. Many positioning methods have been proposed to solve that problem, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the most widely used wireless technologies. This paper takes BLE Angle of Arrival (AOA) as the research object and proposes a method based on signal fitting and Propagator Direct Data Acquisition (PDDA) angle estimation algorithm. This method can be applied to both linear antenna array and rectangular antenna array and has good positioning performance. The method proposed in this paper does not need to calculate the phase differences between antennas, making it unnecessary to calculate the intersection of cones during spatial positioning. The angle estimation is divided into two steps. Firstly, the frequency deviation of Constant Tone Extension (CTE) is calculated based on the IQ samples captured during the reference period, and the received signal matrix of all antennas is fitted based on frequency deviation. Secondly, the antenna received signal model is established based on hardware antenna arrangement, and the arrival angle is estimated by the PDDA algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the plane and spatial positioning experiments are carried out using the BLE devices of Nordic Company, which shows a good positioning accuracy. In spatial positioning, the average positioning accuracy of BLE in channel 37, channel 38, and channel 39 is 0.59m, 0.74m, and 0.77m, respectively, which can meet the basic indoor positioning requirements and cover a large area by one receiver. Compared with the classical MUSIC algorithm, the PDDA algorithm has the same positioning accuracy but lower computational complexity, so it has certain advantages.

Despite these promising applications and thorough research, indoor localization remains a very challenging topic and (near) perfect accuracy continues to be an open research challenge. In this paper, we acknowledge the growth and potential of smart home environments and focus on the usage of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless indoor positioning in such cases. This is in contrast with existing work around BLE that more focuses on use-cases in large public areas or buildings. In particular, we compare the applicability of different distance functions for the fingerprinting localization method and propose a dynamic approach of selecting the most suited distance function. Furthermore, we investigate the impact on the quality of the fingerprints by looking at directional fingerprints and search space restrictions. Finally, we discuss the design and usage of a real-life location-aware smart home application, where a user controls the lights in a room through gestures.

WiFi Fingerprinting using a mobile phone is perhaps the most widely used method. However, this is powerhungry, and its typical positioning accuracy (2.0 to 3.0 meters) is not enough to differentiate between adjacent narrow aisles to locate items. In this paper, we present a novel (Bluetooth Low Energy) BLE Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) ranking based fingerprinting method that uses Kendall Tau Correlation Coefficient (KTCC) to correlate a new signal position with the signal strength ranking of multiple low-power iBeacon devices situated in a retail space. This offers a higher positioning accuracy and is supported in recent smartphones. An important source of error is the RSSI, which varies depending on the model and orientation of the phone. We present a novel way to mitigate this. We validated our method in a retail-like indoor space of Queen Mary Library. We achieved an average positioning error of 0.87 meters which was sufficient to differentiate between physical space aisles.

In addition, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE), a smartphone, a server, and a web page have been added to the system for remote monitoring. The TE can be attached to and removed from the singlet by a Velcro, which allows the user to dry-clean the TE easily for long-term use. A new holter-based ECG system has been designed to evaluate the TE-based ECG system and the average correlation between the recorded ECG signals is obtained as 99.23. A filtered digital signal, with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 45.62 dB, is transmitted to the smartphone via BLE. The ECG signal is plotted, the HR is calculated with 1.83 mean absolute percentage error, and displayed. The data are sent to the server, allowing the patient's physician to analyze the signals in real time through the web page or the smartphone. If HR reaches beyond the normal range or user presses the "HELP" button on the smartphone screen, the physician is informed automatically by an short message service (SMS) with a location pin on the map.

The proposed indoor positioning system utilizes 4 Estimote BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons to measure the user position with a smartphone. Each beacon broadcasts radio signal and a smartphone can receive these signals to estimate the distance by measuring RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values. In this paper, we proposed a new estimation algorithm to robustly calculate a user's position based on the strength of received signals. The proposed algorithm collects signals at a pre-processing stage to improve the quality of RSSI values, calculates the distance according to the signal strength from each beacon, and then estimates the user position with the triangulation of overlapped regions. The experimental result of our proposed indoor positioning system shows approximately 80% of accuracy within 2m error bound for three types of room. The proposed indoor position tracking is simple and well-suited with low-cost BLE beacons.

Recent advances in smart parking systems adopt Internet of Things (IoT) concepts which tend to improve traffic bottlenecks by providing information about available parking lots. The detection of vehicle presence at the parking lot usually means adopting solutions comprised of power-hungry and battery-operated sensor devices. In this article a hardware-based approach is introduced which aims at building a self-powered and autonomous sensing node equipped with supercapacitors (battery less) to feel the vehicle presence. For purposes of detection, solar-based energy harvester and wake-up trigger prototype is considered along with a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radio. The joint use of such technologies is exploited to develop a power autonomous node capable of cost-effectively sensing the car presence and transmitting the parking lot status. The developed triggering system consumes only 150 nA making it suitable as a low-power solution. To initiate the trigger only 6.5 W/m(2) in light level change is required comparing the two panels, which is more than adequate as the comparison of solar irradiance measured under the vehicle against diffuse horizontal irradiance shows a significant difference. The developed prototype uses a magnetometer to verify the vehicle presence upon trigger generation and BLE 5.0 technology for status change update, while supercapacitor discharge lifetime duration is estimated to be around 13 days in harsh conditions without charging from solar cells.

The RX employs a type-II loop configuration that offers improved stability compared with the previous type-I PT-RX solutions. In addition, the type-II loop is also very tolerant of long run-lengths of consecutive "1" or "0" symbol sequences. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the prototype PT-RX targets Bluetooth low energy (BLE) standard consuming only 1.5 mW at a supply of <= 0.7 V. It maintains an adjacent-channel rejection (ACR) of >=-11/3.5/17/27 dB at 0/+/- 1/+/- 2/+/- 3 MHz offset and can tolerate out-of-band (OOB) blockers of minimum -21 dBm across 1.0-3.5 GHz while also offering a best-in-class figure of merit (FoM) of 181 dB, with a 1-Mb/s BLE sensitivity of -93 dBm.

The prospects of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for smart farming are immense. However, the cost and the ease in controlling UAVs for smart farming might play an important role for motivating farmers to use UAVs in farming. Mostly, UAVs are controlled by remote controllers using radio waves. There are several technologies such as Wi-Fi or ZigBee that are also used for controlling UAVs. However, Smart Bluetooth (also referred to as Bluetooth Low Energy) is a wireless technology used to transfer data over short distances. Smart Bluetooth is cheaper than other technologies and has the advantage of being available on every smart phone. Farmers can use any smart phone to operate their respective UAVs along with Bluetooth Smart enabled agricultural sensors in the future. However, certain requirements and challenges need to be addressed before UAVs can be operated for smart agriculture-related applications. Hence, in this article, an attempt has been made to explore the types of sensors suitable for smart farming, potential requirements and challenges for operating UAVs in smart agriculture. We have also identified the future applications of using UAVs in smart farming.

Epidemic Exposure Tracking With Wearables: A Machine Learning Approach to Contact Tracing	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Sensors; COVID-19; Machine learning; Temperature measurement; Coronaviruses; Wearable computers; Protocols; Bluetooth low energy; contact tracing; disease outbreak; physical distancing; smartwatch; wearables; COVID-19; proximity sensing; pandemic; artificial intelligence; supervised learning; neural network	COVID-19 CLASSIFICATION; BLUETOOTH; LOCALIZATION; PROXIMITY; ACCURACY	The recent pandemic revealed weaknesses in several areas, including the limited capacity of public health systems for efficient case tracking and reporting. In the post-pandemic era, it is essential to be ready and provide not only preventive measures, but also effective digital strategies and solutions to protect our population from future outbreaks. This work presents a contact tracing solution based on wearable devices to track epidemic exposure. Our proximity-based privacy-preserving contact tracing (P3CT) integrates: 1) the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for reliable proximity sensing, 2) a machine-learning approach to classify the exposure risk of a user, and 3) an ambient signature protocol for preserving the user's identity. Proximity sensing exploits the signals emitted from a smartwatch to estimate users' interaction, in terms of distance and duration. Supervised learning is then used to train four classification models to identify the exposure risk of a user with respect to a patient diagnosed with an infectious disease. Finally, our proposed P3CT protocol uses ambient signatures to anonymize the infected patient's identity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed solution for real-world contact tracing problems. The large-scale dataset consisting of the signal information collected from the smartwatch is available online. According to experimental results, wearable devices along with machine learning models are a promising approach for epidemic exposure notification and tracking.

Bluetooth (BT) and BT Low Energy (BLE) technology is often embedded in such devices to support connectivity to a personal mobile device or a dock, when parked. BT/BLE transmit periodic beacons for node discovery that can be explored for V2X applications, such as safety and fleet management. We present a distributed system that explores periodic BT beacons sent by a module embedded in a bicycle to opportunistically locate nodes of interest (NOI). We address the particular application of stolen bicycle detection. In a scenario in which a bicycle is stolen and has its communication system tampered with but BLE remains functional, a service provider (e.g., fleet operator, authorities) is informed of this new NOI and shares an updated NOI list with the NOI detection-enabled bicycles. In turn, the bicycles flag contacts with stolen bicycles to the provider backoffice, at the earliest convenience (depending on available communications interfaces: immediately if cellular is available, or opportunistically when passing by a dock). We describe the operation and software architecture of the system, and an actual implementation in COTS equipment. Experimental measurements of the communication range and a demonstration of the system for proof-of-concept are also reported.

Coexistence Evaluation of Densely Deployed BLE-based Body Area Networks	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 04-08, 2017	YourSingapore, Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE, Intel, Natl Instruments, Huawei, Keysight Technologies Inc, Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Rohde & Schwarz	YourSingapore		BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; PERFORMANCE	In wireless body area network (BAN) applications such as wearable computing, healthcare and sports, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a new and promising technology, which uses the unlicensed 2.4-GHz spectrum band for data transmission. Since there exist many wireless technologies operating in this frequency band, the issues of cross-technology interference and coexistence present a major challenge. In this work, we develop a testbed to conduct our experimental studies, focusing on BLE and its coexistence capabilities when being deployed in a dense environment, under possible interference from WiFi and ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4. One scenario of interest is a network of several co-located BLE-based BANs, each of which is designed in a star topology with one gateway and multiple BLE sensor nodes. The second scenario represents a highly heterogeneous network where each BAN now carries both BLE and ZigBee sensors, while being exposed to interference from external WiFi transmission. Our results show that the performance of BLE is relatively robust to interference from other BLE transmissions as well as those from nearby ZigBee and WiFi devices.

Especially nowadays sitting periods at work or at home are increasing, and therefore consistent stance monitoring can help users improve their sitting habits and avoid related complications. In this work, we present SPoMo a real-time, practical, wearable system that automatically tracks the user's sitting posture, through wireless sensors attached to his back. Our prototype is based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that monitor the angle deviation from the optimal position. We have also developed a cloud-assisted mobile application able to continuously visualize the user's stance, archive his performance over time and provide insight for future development of proper posture. We focus on presenting SPoMo functionality and experimentally evaluate its performance. Our results prove our system to be accurate and therefore a good every-day solution that helps the consumer to avoid chronic improper posture.

In this paper, we propose a navigation system for car owners to find their cars in indoor parking garages. The proposed system comprises a car-searching mobile app and a positioning-assisting subsystem. The app guides car owners to their cars based on a "turn-by-turn" navigation strategy, and has the ability to correct the user's heading orientation. The subsystem uses beacon technology for indoor positioning, supporting self-guidance of the car-searching mobile app. This study also designed a local coordinate system to support the identification of the locations of parking spaces and beacon devices. We used Android as the platform to implement the proposed car-searching mobile app, and used Bytereal HiBeacon devices to implement the proposed positioning-assisting subsystem. We also deployed the system in a parking lot in our campus for testing. The experimental results verified that the proposed system not only works well, but also provides the car owner with the correct route guidance information.

The vast majority of mild and moderate OSA patients are positional patients, which means that these patients show most of their breathing abnormalities while sleeping in supine position. For these patients positional therapy may be a simple and effective treatment solution. In this study we present a training system for positional patients to alert them when a SpO(2) desaturation is occurring, or when they spend a long period of time sleeping in supine position. The alert is given to the patient initially as a smooth vibration in their wrist band, but if the condition persists, a buzzer is used for auditory indication. The system uses an accelerometer on the chest or abdomen to determine the sleeping posture and a commercial finger clip pulse oximeter to monitor heart rate and SpO(2).

However, its indoor positioning performance is still unsatisfactory. In recent years, numerous scholars have investigated Wi-Fi indoor positioning technologies. However, the distance error of such techniques can be higher than 5m. Some scholars have proposed new approaches of beacon-based indoor positioning to provide easier installation and decrease the distance error to 2.5m. For both better positioning performance and being economical, this paper proposes an approach of beacon-based positioning method, using cost-effective Estimate Proximity Beacons and Android smart phones for implementation. The result reveals that the mean distance errors of our method are 0.398m in stasis and 1.97m in motion.

Three protocols in particular, Zigbee, Z-wave, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are used for network communication on a significant number of IoT devices. However, devices utilizing each of these three protocols have been compromised due to either implementation failures by the manufacturer or security shortcomings in the protocol itself. This paper identifies the security features and shortcomings of each protocol citing employed attacks for reference. Additionally, it will serve to help manufacturers make two decisions: First, should they invest in creating their own protocol, and second, if they decide against this, which protocol should they use and how should they implement it to ensure their product is as secure as it can be. These answers are made with respect to the specific factors manufacturers in the IoT space face such as the reversed CIA model with availability usually being the most important of the three and the ease of use versus security tradeoff that manufacturers have to consider. This paper finishes with a section aimed at future research for IoT communication protocols.

However, this typical usage of a gateway is not suitable for every application. For short-range IoT wireless protocols [e.g., Bluetooth low energy (BLE)], multiple gateways are required to achieve broader coverage, which is inconvenient. In this article, an edge-based hybrid network system architecture is presented. The proposed system consists of hybrid routers and an IoT gateway. The router supports two wireless protocols, BLE and long range (LoRa), and is equipped with a solar energy harvester to extend the router's lifetime. It can extend the coverage of short-range BLE network by utilizing LoRa wireless technology, and support fundamental edge computing tasks such as preliminary data processing. The IoT gateway can support multiple IoT protocols, including LoRa, BLE, and XBee. It can perform more advanced edge computing tasks, such as data filtering, storage, processing, user interface, and cloud connection. Three case studies incorporating a wearable safety monitoring sensor network, a healthcare monitoring application, and a smart hospital application are studied with the proposed edge network system to demonstrate its promising capabilities to support IoT applications. Experimental evaluations indicate that by processing data at the edge, the minimal delay is only 11.5 ms. Furthermore, with the hybrid LoRa network implementation, the BLE network can be extended to 2.4 km.

First of all, multi-directional fingerprints are collected dynamically, and sparse fingerprint database is generated by combining Received Signal Strength (RSS) and coordinates. Subsequently, RSS of each new Reference Point (RP) is estimated by using optimized RBF approach. In particular, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize shape parameter, so as to improve interpolation accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve high localization accuracy as well as significantly reduce fingerprint database construction effort.

The smart charging system proposed in this paper allows the control of the electric vehicle's battery charging current in real time, based on the demand at the residence (home current), which is measured using a residential wireless sensor network (WSN). An Android mobile app was developed to access the vehicle's data. This app communicates with the wireless sensor nodes of an intro-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN), which was developed using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol.

PLL Fractional Spur's Impact on FSK Spectrum and a Synthesizable ADPLL for a Bluetooth Transmitter	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Phase locked loops; Frequency shift keying; Routing; Clocks; Harmonic analysis; Calibration; Analog circuits; All-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL); Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); fractional-N PLL; open source hardware; synthesizable PLL	N DIGITAL PLL; CALIBRATION; MDLL	In this work, we present an open-source fullysynthesizable fractional-N all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) designed for a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transmitter (TX) along with a semi-analytical model of the PLL fractional spur's impact on the BLE output spectrum. Based on the model and the BLE specification for spur emission, a requirement for the PLL fractional spurs is derived. To meet the derived spectral mask by reducing the fractional spurs, a novel synthesizable two-step time to digital converter (TSTDC) that employs embedded TDC (EMBTDC) as coarse and Vernier delay-line TDC (DLTDC) as fine TDC is proposed. We also present a digital calibration scheme to compensate for the nonlinearity induced by the place-and-route (P&R) tool. The PLL is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET and demonstrated in a BLE-TX. The measured BLE transmissions satisfy the standard requirements thanks to the reduced fractional spurs. In a standalone PLL mode, the proposed TSTDC and calibration scheme reduced the fractional spurs by 14.3 dB compared to only using an EMBTDC in near integer N operation. The PLL supports a frequency range of 1.8-2.7 GHz and consumes 3.91 mW at 2.4006 GHz achieving figure of merit (FoM) of -220.7 dB in fractional-N mode with a 40 MHz reference, occupying an area of 0.063 mm(2). A highly automated design flow is used for the PLL to lower the barrier for new developers and reduce the porting cost.	[Kwon, Kyumin; Abdelatty, Omar A.

At the same time, ubiquitous sensing encourages tiny, unobtrusive, energy-harvesting devices to eliminate the limited lifetime of batterypowered devices. In this paper, we design a new fire-and-forget room number broadcaster beacon to investigate the feasibility and performance of such a design point. We study how several factors including different deployment spaces, the storage capacity of the harvester, indoor light intensity levels, and spatial position of the receiver impact the performance in three real-world deployments. We find that the 95th percentile of inter-packet reception time is 35 s or less in a lab space with exposure to sunlight and indoor lights, 29 s or less in an industrial plant with indoor lights, and 405 s or more in office rooms. With strategic beacon placement and a light intensity level of only 390 lx, performance can be improved by 61%. We believe that these results will help guide future energy-harvesting beacon deployments. We also outline possible improvements for future energy-harvesting beacon designs.

The issue has been a hidden underneath bit energy and power consumptions of the devices. First, recent advances have changed energy consumption of the devices and secondly, in terms of power efficiency, the coding gain of the systems have been suppressed by Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) definition where the bit energy to noise ratio (Eb/No) value of the reception is more meaningful providing direct comparative value for the systems. In the end, the paper has concluded that the diversity gains of the systems are more effective, whatever the technique can provide a diversity gain over statistical average.

Indeed, museum managers are always pleased to hold these kinds of events where it offers the opportunity to the public to be a part of such experimentation and allowing us at the same time to popularize our research with them. In this paper, we describe an experiment that held within the museum of natural history of La Rochelle with a class of high school volunteers. We will explain our systems that has been built to work in this specific case, and among other things formalize our algorithm for indoor localization that has not had an equivalent in the state of the art. The minimal zone searching algorithm (MZS) can compute in real time the position of a visitor, shaped as a zone with an average surface of 3 m 2 when resources are limited and when the placement of nodes must respect the constraints imposed by the room's layout. This method offered good results with data collected during the experimentation, such as a meaningful representation of the position of a visitor and most importantly a stable execution during the whole experience even when the subject was in tight spaces.

An Outdoor Navigation Assistance System for Visually Impaired People in Public Transportation	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Navigation; Mobile applications; Real-time systems; Cameras; Indoor navigation; Global Positioning System; Blindness; Assistive technology; visually impaired people; partially sighted passenger; mobile application; public transport; Bluetooth low energy technology	BLIND PEOPLE; INDOOR; RECOGNITION	Visually impaired and blind people (VIBP) have to face significant difficulties locating public transport vehicles and bus stops due to their vision restrictions. Over the past decade, diverse assistance systems have been developed to solve this problem. However, most of them are based upon the global positioning system (GPS) and present satellite coverage problems in indoor environments. Some others are wearable prototypes that turn out to be onerous for the user. This paper presents an assistance system for VIBP in the use of public transportation. The proposed system uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for location and communication purposes, and a mobile application for user-smartphone interaction. The BLE beacons are installed on buses and their stops; accordingly, the mobile application tracks them in real-time and provides the relevant information to the user employing verbal instructions; transportation line, destination, next stop name, and current location. This information allows the user to properly select the desired bus in advance and get off at the correct destination stop. The proposed system has been tested in two scenarios: 1) under controlled conditions and 2) in a real environment. The results show that the proposed system is 97.6% effective when VIBP travel independently from one point to another. In addition, according to an assessment sheet completed by the participants, the proposed system grants them greater confidence and independence than GPS-based systems because of the following reasons; firstly, it can work with an internet connection or without an internet connection. Secondly, it is not an onerous system; information about the location of vehicles and stops is provided in real-time. Last but not least, it does not present satellite coverage problems in indoor environments.

As the traffic demand increases, APs are more densely deployed and the number of operating Wi-Fi channels also increases, which, however, results in additional scanning delay and makes the scanning a burdensome task. In this paper, we note that the co-location of Wi-Fi protocol with BLE protocol is a common practice in IoT networks, and develop a Wi-Fi passive scanning framework that uses BLE to assist scanning. Although the framework has great potential to improve scanning performance without explicit message exchanges, there are technical challenges related to time synchronization and channel switching delay. We address the challenges and develop a practical passive scanning scheme, named BLESS-Sync. We verify its performance through testbed experiments and extensive simulations, and show that BLESS-Sync significantly outperforms legacy Wi-Fi scanning in terms of scanning delay and energy efficiency.

Multiple indoor positioning algorithms have been researched and improved to provide better accuracy. For the purpose of the internet of things Bluetooth 4 (BLE) was introduced. However, a Bluetooth 4 signal is highly affected by obstruction attenuation and multipath. Deploying the BLE beacon could impose a significant cost if a large number of beacons need to be employed to avoid the obstacle attenuation and multipath effects. This paper proposes an algorithm to identify a beacon placed in a different room (isolated beacon). The proposed algorithm has a 68% probability of estimating the correct condition with an accuracy of up to 78% for a high attenuation obstruction.

Radio-frequency-based indoor-localization techniques for enhancing Internet-of-Things applications	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						Indoor location; Bluetooth Low Energy; Wi-Fi RTT	LOCATION; MOTION	An important capability of most smart, Internet-of-Things-enabled spaces (e.g., office, home, hospital, factory) is the ability to leverage context of use. Location is a key context element, particularly indoor location. Recent advances in radio ranging technologies, such as Wi-Fi RTT, promise the availability of low-cost, near-ubiquitous time-of-flight-based ranging estimates. In this paper, we build on prior work to enhance this ranging technology's ability to provide useful location estimates. For further improvements, we model user motion behavior to estimate the user motion state by taking the temporal measurements available from time-of-flight ranging. We select the velocity parameter of a particle-filter-based on this motion state. We demonstrate meaningful improvements in coordinate-based estimation accuracy and substantial increases in room-level estimation accuracy. Furthermore, insights gained in our real-world deployment provide important implications for future Internet-of-Things applications and their supporting technology deployments such as social interaction, workflow management, inventory control, or healthcare information tools.

Each sensor was powered by accumulators charged by an (8 x 14) cm(2) solar panel. The energy budget was carefully managed to allow long operating time for both the moisture sensor and the irrigation automation. We present here the hardware-software setup implemented in our proprietary moisture sensor for wireless communication, using Bluetooth Low Energy modules (BLE). The autonomy of the system may reach 4-5 cloudy days without the need of recharging the accumulators from the sun. Over the entire operating period, the moisture sensors send data wirelessly every sampling time (15 to 30 minutes) following water drips on the soil for the next 30 seconds, pushed by a low power micro pump. The micro-irrigation process is repeated every sampling time, until the soil moisture threshold is reached. In between the operating states, the sensor and watering automation go to sleep. The software algorithm ensures low energy (max. 2.8 mWh) consumption for the moisture sensor and 20 mWh for the irrigation automation, substantially increasing the accumulators discharge cycle.

In general those devices need to be connected to a computer to function properly. Moreover, applications that project images on such an HMD respond typically only to user inputs like mouse and keyboard actions and head movement. In this paper we go a step further by proposing a framework in which the movements of a person are translated into actions in a virtual world. This allows a user to walk around freely while wearing an HMD, increasing the reality of the virtual experience. We will focus in detail on the challenges related to the localization of the user and discuss different options like existing wireless localization technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and an object recognition algorithm. The latter is used in the final solution. Furthermore, we present an experimental and mobile setup to use an HMD in a portable manner. Our solution is demonstrated through a multiplayer game, in which two players compete against each other to capture a flag.

This article proposes a system architecture using industrial Internet of Things and digital twin technologies to fulfill spatial-temporal traceability and visibility with seamless cyber-physical synchronization for finished goods logistics in the workshop. A long short-term memory network-enabled genetic indoor-tracking algorithm (GITA) is developed to locate product trolleys via a bluetooth low energy technology, with ultra-wideband applied to sample labeling in the training stage. It is enlightened by genetics to achieve self-adapting online for the long-term performance. A feature selection method based on received signal strength indicator is designed to deal with signal multipath fading and streamline the learning process. In addition, the spatial-temporal information obtained is leveraged to activate location-based services that can help promote operational efficiency. Moreover, a real-life case study is carried out in a world-leading computer manufacturer's factory to illustrate the viability and practicality of the system and methods proposed, with hardware and software developed. By comparison, the GITA shows superiority over existing approaches despite various noises under the manufacturing scenario, attaining a location precision of about 2 m with a 98.12% accuracy.

Since Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is available in almost every IoT device in the market nowadays, a key to localizing and tracking IoT devices is to develop an accurate ranging technique for BLE-enabled IoT devices. This is, however, a challenging feat as billions of these devices are already in use, and for pragmatic reasons, we cannot propose to modify the IoT device (a BLE peripheral) itself. Furthermore, unlike WiFi ranging - where the channel state information (CSI) is readily available and the bandwidth can be increased by stitching 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands together to achieve a high-precision ranging, an unmodified BLE peripheral provides us with only the RSSI information over a very limited bandwidth. Accurately ranging a BLE device is therefore far more challenging than other wireless standards. In this paper, we exploit characteristics of BLE protocol (e.g. frequency hopping and empty control packet transmissions) and propose a technique to directly estimate the range of a BLE peripheral from a BLE access point by multipath profiling. We discuss the theoretical foundation and conduct experiments to show that the technique achieves a 2.44m absolute range estimation error on average.

Since the amount of harvested energy is very limited, it is impossible for the nodes to even "listen" continuously for the packets from neighbors. For the proper scheduling of communication, clock synchronization between the nodes is required. This paper describes the clock synchronization design for WSN in case the continuous listening is not possible. Practical power consumption measurements based on Nordic nRF52840 chip are provided. Parameters selection to minimize the clock synchronization time and power consumption are investigated and example calculations of Lightricity solar panel are provided for reference. Using only 140 mu W from this panel, designed clock synchronization allows 2 nodes to be synchronized within 180s time interval with typical 10ms error.

Thus, in general, based on the IP address to access the service uses the IP-based filtering techniques that limit the delivery of the service. We offer a novel location based authentication method by convenient and correct way to take advantage of the Bluetooth BLE Beacon technology using smart mobile devices or laptop devices. In this research, digital content manager initiates and broadcasts BLE beacon signal for checking the presence of users near a specified area/location. We make use of the BLE Sensor Tag device as the location identification method. In this work, a publisher wants to identify whether a user is from a certain institution subscribed as site license for a period of time or not. Until now, the publisher depends on only IP filtering technique to discriminate users. The IP filtering technique allows the publisher to exclude certain IP ranges from accessing the content. So, the publisher wants to leverage users or readers to pay for accessing a technical paper by credit card. In this research, a token is HMACSHA1 generated by a Beacon based on UUID and Time. The MAC is provided only to a person who is closed to a specified location. If a member has the token, our system will connect and report to the server that the users/students are attended the class or near the manager. If the member does not have the token, our system will report to the server that the users/students are not attended the class or not near the manager. By this way a publisher can easily check the readers/users has the right to access the contents. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Current approaches focus on the use of cloud-hosted backend services which allow file and app-state synchronization but fail in providing true resource sharing among mobile devices. To enable true resource/service sharing, the mobile devices of a single user should be combined into a cloud of cooperating mobile devices. Instead of accessing the resources/services of an individual device, a user should be able to seamlessly access the combined resources/services of his/her device cloud. Enabling seamless access to the resources/services hosted on different mobile devices is therefore a key challenge. Exposing the resources/services of each mobile devices within the user's device cloud via RESTful micro-services, is one possible approach. This paper focusses on the use of the IoT protocol CoAP as an application layer protocol. To minimize the energy costs of communication, it was necessary to replace CoAP's standard transport protocol (UDP) with BLE 4.1. This paper presents the performance of the CoAP protocol using BLE 4.1 on Android Lollipop.

In our approach to RPL over BLE, we propose to use both of advertising and data channels of BLE to create synergistic effects between RPL and BLE to jointly achieve high energy efficiency and reliable multi-hop routing. We design an adaptation layer between BLE and RPL (ALBER) which tightly couples RPL and BLE operations together. Specifically, ALBER provides RPL control message broadcast through BLE, RPL routing metric calculation that reflects BLE link quality, and routing table update that incorporates BLE connection management. We implement ALBER in a Linux kernel to realize RPL over BLE and compare its performance with that of RPL over IEEE 802.15.4 on a multi-hop testbed network. The performance results show that our architecture is not only feasible but also provides almost perfect packet delivery performance (similar to 100%) and reduces duty-cycle up to 32% compared to RPL over IEEE 802.15.4 under varying link dynamics. Our research shows that RPL over BLE is a promising approach which can increase the utility and impact of BLE across different application domains.

For these cases, an in-vehicle router is important because in-vehicle devices communicate with the external server via the in-vehicle router. The in-vehicle router activates devices outside the vehicle as necessary and maintain a stable speed for the in-vehicle devices. We proposed two methods to reduce the inaccurate activation of wireless devices and improve the throughput for in-vehicle wireless communication. The proposed methods were evaluated through field tests. These results showed that the probability of false positives was reduced and the throughput for each passenger was improved for each vehicle. These two methods were integrated into one system, and the system was used to provide appropriate information only for users who visited a destination.

A Computationally Efficient Method for Direction Finding with Known Transmit Sequence	2018 NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDOOR POSITIONING AND INDOOR NAVIGATION (IPIN 2018)	International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	SEP 24-27, 2018	Nantes, FRANCE	Team Geoloc, IFSTTAR		Angle of arrival; direction finding; localisation; Bluetooth low energy	DOA ESTIMATION	Angle of arrival (AoA) estimation or direction finding (DF) has been extensively studied in the literature. Many existing AoA estimation algorithms perform a search over the entire angle space for the correct result. While such computational complexity is manageable in a number of scenarios, for future commercial small and low power wireless devices such as Bluetooth based internet of things (IoT) devices, the existing methods may not be feasible. This problem is exacerbated in 3D DF where the elevation angles also need to be computed. In this paper, a low complexity direction finding approach is presented which assumes that the transmit sequence is known. Under additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean, averaging the received sequence over multiple time instances 'filters' out the noise. The task of determining the azimuth and elevation angles then reduces to simpler operations. We show that the proposed method yields similar estimation accuracy as the conventional MUSIC algorithm in both free space single path as well as indoor multipath environments while needs much less computation. The proposed method may also be used in combination with existing algorithms developed for more complicated DF scenarios.

Design patterns have been shown to be a pragmatic solution to control and manage information flows and provide order and meaning to data within a given context. Assisting users within their daily activities has become a key aspect for modern Artificial Intelligence Systems. Nevertheless, although the GPS technologies work well for outside location, indoor positioning is still problematic, while is a vital awareness component in ambient assistance. This paper shows a preliminary Bluetooth tracking system with a focus on the user's transition between areas of interest.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to develop an autonomous system for collecting environmental noise information. We designed a system to be highly scalable, easy to use, low-cost, and low-powered to encourage its widespread adoption. Power usage is kept low by investigating the use of Bluetooth Low Energy communication protocol for streaming environmental noise. Beyond merely detecting noise levels, the proposed system can classify the source of the measured noise. Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients are used to produce features of the noise and model Gaussian mixture models to classify the source of the noise. Information from the system is sent to a cloud storage service in real-time which enables visualization of noise levels, noise sources and battery level of the sensors in our web application. The system was able to reliably collect information over a 4-week field test. It has an average classification accuracy of 72% when subjected to four common environmental noise sources.

This wastage in part stems from the lack of real-time visibility of fine-grained thermal distribution in DCs. Wireless sensing is an ideal candidate for DC monitoring as it is cost-effective, facility-friendly, and can be easily re-purposed. In this paper, we develop LEMoNet, a novel low-energy battery operated wireless sensor network design for monitoring DCs. It employs a two-tier network architecture and a multi-mode data exchange protocol to balance the trade-offs between low power consumption and high data reliability. We have evaluated the performance of LEMoNet by deploying custom-designed sensor and gateway nodes in a production DC as well as through extensive simulation studies in networks of various sizes. We show experimentally that LEMoNet achieves an average data yield over 98% in the production DC. It scales well in large and dense networks in large-scale simulations. Under normal operations with one temperature and one humidity reading every thirty seconds, the battery lifetime of LEMoNet sensor nodes is projected to be 14.9 years on a single lithium coin battery.

However, due to its simple communication protocol architecture, which broadcasts a static payload, a BLE beacon-based infrastructure is vulnerable to different types of abuses and attacks, in particular free-riding and device spoofing. Many beacon manufacturers propose dynamically randomizing beacon advertisement packets at the device firmware level as a solution. However, this approach is difficult to implement for already deployed beacon nodes as it requires a firmware update on each device. To alleviate these drawbacks, a crowd-assisted architecture for securing BLE beacons is proposed in this paper. A detailed architecture is presented along with experimental results and an implementation to demonstrate its feasibility. It is found that the beacon ID can be changed by user's mobile phone within a 20 m range with probability of almost 100% under both stationary and mobile conditions.

However, the beacon performance is poor in terms of the indoor positioning accuracy because of noise, motion, and fading, all of which are characteristics of a bluetooth signal and depend on the installation location. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of beacon-based indoor positioning technology by fusing it with existing indoor positioning technology, which uses Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and so forth. This study proposes a beacon-based indoor positioning method using an extended Kalman filter that recursively processes input data including noise. After defining the movement of a smartphone on a flat two-dimensional surface, it was assumed that the beacon signal is nonlinear. Then, the standard deviation and properties of the beacon signal were analyzed. According to the analysis results, an extended Kalman filter was designed and the accuracy of the smartphone's indoor position was analyzed through simulations and tests. The proposed technique achieved good indoor positioning accuracy, with errors of 0.26 m and 0.28 m from the average x- and y-coordinates, respectively, based solely on the beacon signal.

They are used to monitor and control the environment by organizing the acquired data at a central device. Constructing fully connected networks using low power consumption sensors, devices, and protocols is one of the main challenges facing wireless sensor networks, especially in places where it is difficult to establish wireless networks in a normal way, such as military areas, archaeological sites, agricultural districts, construction sites, and so on. This paper proposes an approach for constructing and extending Bi-Directional mesh networks using low power consumption technologies inside various indoors and outdoors architectures called "an adaptable Spider-Mesh topology". The use of ESP-NOW protocol as a communication technology added an advantage of longer communication distance versus a slight increase of consumed power. It provides 15 times longer distance compared to BLE protocol while consuming only twice as much power. Therefore, according to our theoretical and experimental comparisons, the proposed approach could provide higher network coverage while maintaining an acceptable level of power consumption.

Researchers from all over the world have proposed many solutions for indoor positioning over the past several years. However, owing to the dynamic and complex nature of indoor environments, accurately and efficiently localising targets in indoor environments remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor positioning algorithm based on the received signal strength indication and pedestrian dead reckoning. In order to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our proposed probabilistic position selection algorithm in mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, a low-complexity identification approach is proposed to identify the change in the channel situation between NLOS and LOS. Numerical experiment results indicate that our proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy and is less impacted by NLOS errors than other conventional methods in mixed LOS and NLOS indoor environments.

A Smart Wireless Ear-Worn Device for Cardiovascular and Sweat Parameter Monitoring During Physical Exercise: Design and Performance Results	SENSORS			English	Article						wearables; ear; electrocardiogram; sweat; lactate; pH; Bluetooth Low Energy	FINITE INTEGRATION TECHNIQUE; VITAL SIGNS; TOMOGRAPHY; COLLECTION; SYSTEM	Wearable biomedical technology has gained much support lately as devices have become more affordable to the general public and they can easily interact with mobile phones and other platforms. The feasibility and accuracy of the data generated by these devices so as to replace the standard medical methods in use today is still under scrutiny. In this paper, we present an ear-worn device to measure cardiovascular and sweat parameters during physical exercise. ECG bipolar recordings capture the electric potential around both ears, whereas sweat rate is estimated by the impedance method over one segment of tissue closer to the left ear, complemented by the measurement of the lactate and pH levels using amperiometric and potentiometric sensors, respectively. Together with head acceleration, the acquired data is sent to a mobile phone via BLE, enabling extended periods of signal recording. Results obtained by the device have shown a SNR level of 18 dB for the ECG signal recorded around the ears, a THD value of -20.46 dB for the excitation signal involved in impedance measurements, sweat conductivity of 0.08 S/m at 1 kHz and sensitivities of 50 mV/pH and 0.8 A/mM for the pH and lactate acquisition channels, respectively. Testing of the device was performed in human subjects during indoors cycling with characteristic level changes.

This wastage in part stems from the lack of real-time visibility of fine-grained thermal distribution in DCs. Wireless sensing is an ideal candidate for DC monitoring as it is cost-effective, facility-friendly, and can be easily re-purposed. In this paper, we develop LEMoNet, a novel low-energy battery operated wireless sensor network design for monitoring DCs. It employs a two-tier network architecture and a multi-mode data exchange protocol to balance the trade-offs between low power consumption and high data reliability. We have evaluated the performance of LEMoNet by deploying custom-designed sensor and gateway nodes in a production DC as well as through extensive simulation studies in networks of various sizes. We show experimentally that LEMoNet achieves an average data yield over 98% in the production DC. It scales well in large and dense networks in large-scale simulations. Under normal operations with one temperature and one humidity reading every thirty seconds, the battery lifetime of LEMoNet sensor nodes is projected to be 14.9 years on a single lithium coin battery.

Among them, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons are a popular option for practical applications. This paper presents a new BLE RSS database that was created to aid in the development of new BLE RSS-based positioning methods and to encourage their reproducibility and comparability. The measurements were collected in two university zones: an area among bookshelves in a library and an area of an office space. Each zone had its own batch of deployed iBKS 105 beacons, configured to broadcast advertisements every 200 ms. The collection in the library zone was performed using three Android smartphones of different brands and models, with beacons broadcasting at -12 dBm transmission power, while in the other zone the collection was performed using of one those smartphones with beacons configured to advertise at the -4 dBm, -12 dBm and -20 dBm transmission powers. Supporting materials and scripts are provided along with the database, which annotate the BLE readings, provide details on the collection, the environment, and the BLE beacon deployments, ease the database usage, and introduce the reader to BLE RSS-based positioning and its challenges.

Increasingly, these use cases require the storage of sensitive user data or critical device controls on the BLE device, as well as the access of this data by an augmentative mobile application. Uncontrolled access to such data could violate user privacy, cause a device to malfunction, or even endanger lives. The BLE standard provides security mechanisms such as pairing and bonding to protect sensitive data such that only authenticated devices can access it. In this paper we show how unauthorized co-located Android applications can access pairing-protected BLE data, without the user's knowledge. We discuss mitigation strategies in terms of the various stakeholders involved in this ecosystem, and argue that at present, the only possible option for securing BLE data is for BLE developers to implement remedial measures in the form of application-layer security between the BLE device and the Android application. We introduce BLE-Cryptracer, a tool for identifying the presence of such application-layer security, and present the results of a large-scale static analysis over 18,900+ BLE-enabled Android applications. Our findings indicate that over 45% of these applications do not implement measures to protect BLE data, and that cryptography is sometimes applied incorrectly in those that do. This implies that a potentially large number of corresponding BLE peripheral devices are vulnerable to unauthorized data access.

In our previous work, we introduced a generic remote patient monitoring framework (Sensing At-Risk Population) that draws on the classification of human movements using a 3-axial accelerometer and the extraction of indoor localization using Bluetooth low energy beacons, in concert. Using the same framework, this paper addresses the longitudinal analyses of a group of patients in a skilled nursing facility. We try to investigate if the metrics derived from a remote patient monitoring system comprised of physical activity and indoor localization sensors, as well as their association with therapist assessments, provide additional insight into the recovery process of patients receiving rehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to observe longitudinal changes of sensor-based physical activity and indoor localization features of patients receiving rehabilitation at a skilled nursing facility and (2) to investigate if the sensor-based longitudinal changes can complement patients' changes captured by therapist assessments over the course of rehabilitation in the skilled nursing facility. Methods: From June 2016 to November 2017, patients were recruited after admission to a subacute rehabilitation center in Los Angeles, CA. Longitudinal cohort study of patients at a skilled nursing facility was followed over the course of 21 days. At the time of discharge from the skilled nursing facility, the patients were either readmitted to the hospital for continued care or discharged to a community setting. A longitudinal study of the physical therapy, occupational therapy, and sensor-based data assessments was performed. A generalized linear mixed model was used to find associations between functional measures with sensor-based features. Occupational therapy and physical therapy assessments were performed at the time of admission and once a week during the skilled nursing facility admission. Results: Of the 110 individuals in the analytic sample with mean age of 79.4 (SD 5.9) years, 79 (72%) were female and 31 (28%) were male participants. The energy intensity of an individual while in the therapy area was positively associated with transfer activities (beta=.22; SE 0.08; P=.02). Sitting energy intensity showed positive association with transfer activities (beta=.16; SE 0.07; P=.02). Lying down energy intensity was negatively associated with hygiene activities (beta=-.27; SE 0.14; P=.04). The interaction of sitting energy intensity with time (beta=-.13; SE 0.06; P=.04) was associated with toileting activities. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a combination of indoor localization and physical activity tracking produces a series of features, a subset of which can provide crucial information to the story line of daily and longitudinal activity patterns of patients receiving rehabilitation at a skilled nursing facility. The findings suggest that detecting physical activity changes within locations may offer some insight into better characterizing patients' progress or decline.

The SoC fully integrates a dc-dc converter, LDOs, a digitally controlled crystal oscillator (DCXO), a PHY, a microcontroller (MCU), a security engine, an SRAM, and an eFlash memory. A triplesupply configuration and low-voltage circuit design enable the SoC to be applied for a wide range of battery-powered systems energy-efficiently and to extend battery lifetime. The TRX employs a low insertion-loss on-die TRX switch with impedance matching circuits, a pseudodifferential current-mode class-D PA with HD2 calibration, a low-IF RX architecture with fast AGC algorithm and complex CT-Delta Sigma ADCs, and a low-power all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) with fast settling injection LDOs and an LMS-based two-point direct frequency modulation structure. The TRX implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process achieves an output power of +10 dBm with a calibrated HD2 of -63 dBc while consuming 45 mW and sensitivities of -98 dBm in 2-Mb/s BLE and -102 dBm in 256-kb/ s IEEE802.15.4 at 10(-3) BER while consuming 6 mW.

Unfortunately their accuracy might not be sufficient for some of the applications. One way to reduce localization errors is hybrid positioning, which combines measurement results obtained with different techniques. The paper describes a concept of a hybrid localization system in which Bluetooth Low Energy technology is supported with the use of laser proximity sensors. Results from both system parts are fused using a novel, simple positioning algorithm. The proposed system concept was tested using BLE and proximity sensors evaluation boards.

This requires the development of a flexible and standardized communication system in between individual Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) modules and production equipment. Therefore, we first derive the requirements for such a system in order to incorporate them in a generic communication concept. This concept focuses on the zero configuration and user-friendly expandability of the system, in which the communication unit is integrated in each WPT module. The paper describes the communication concept and discusses the advantages and dis-advantages. The work concludes with an outlook on the practical implementation in a research project.

However, the beacon technology can only provide one-way communication. If we need the smartphones to respond to the beacon messages, the smartphone users have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the information back to the backend system. In some cases the mobile Internet services may not be always available. Therefore, we develop an interactive positioning and tracking system based solely on the BLE technology. Specifically, we make the beacon devices capable of two-way communication. On one hand, our beacon devices can detect the presence of a specific customer at specific locations, and then the presence information can be sent to the application server via the BLE mesh network consisting of beacon devices. On the other hand, the application server can send a personalized location-based message to the customer, again via the relay of beacon devices. The benefit of our system is two-fold: not only the customers without Internet connections can enjoy the positioning services, but also the backend system can be aware of the presence of specific customers and track their real-time locations. Experimental results showed that our system is practicable with moderate transmission latencies in the BLE mesh network.

In daycare center, caretakers make a daycare report aiming to improve the senior citizen's Quality of Life. However, in the aged society, it is difficult for caretakers to record the senior citizen's activity in detail, since each caretaker needs to take care of several senior citizens at the same time. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic daycare report generation system. Our proposed system estimates the present area and activity of the senior citizen by utilizing the accelerometer-implemented-BLE-beacon tags and generate the daycare report. Based on the generated report, the caretaker works effectively. Evaluation result in a daycare center showed that our system estimated the subject's present area with F-measure: 80.6% and activity with F-measure: 73.8% and automatically generated the daycare report.

The oral cavity has a large accessible volume and exhibits a temperature close to the deep body temperature; the wireless monitoring of intra-oral temperature is also possible. However, devices must be small enough to not interfere with tongue movement. Here, we fabricated a mouthguard (MG) thermometer that housed a telemeter, a thermistor, and a battery on the buccal side surface of the molar and premolar of the upper jaw. The devices were sealed between two layers of MG material for waterproofing. Sealing the devices induced a longer response time to temperature changes (from 3.2 to 12.2 s), but the quantitative characteristics did not change. Rapid changes in intra-oral temperature were successfully monitored when ingesting water of various temperatures by using the MG thermometer. Moreover, a high correlation between the difference in the intra-oral and water temperatures and the intra-oral temperature change was observed. In addition, stable wireless measurement was possible during 3 h in an office with the wearer engaged in normal activities. The effects of changes in ambient temperature and the wearing of face masks on intra-oral and skin temperatures were also investigated, where an effect of ambient temperature on skin temperature but not on intra-oral temperature was observed. These results suggest that wireless temperature monitoring in the oral cavity is feasible.

For hearing-impaired people these solutions are not suitable. Other systems are equipped also with vibration motors and, thus, let the user choose if vibrations or sound signal are triggered when the alarm starts. These systems, though, require the time adjustment whenever the device is unplugged or when power outage takes place. Moreover, there is no solution available that gives a feedback to the caregivers, in order to be noticed that the user has been indeed waken by the alarm system. Through this paper, we propose an alarm clock system based on vibrations motors, ultrasonic sensors, Bluetooth and LoRa technology and server to wake the user, to ascertain the awakening and to send notifications to the caregivers. In addition, to mitigate the need to adjust the time in the case of a power failure, through the connection to LoRa server and to the battery operation, the time can be automatically updated.

The method has significant advantages: its implementation is easy and since it does not require any information on system infrastructure placement, it can be implemented in already deployed networks. However, it has a significant drawback, which is a high effort needed to create the radio map used for localisation. This study describes a low-effort method for automatic radio map creation intended for use in hybrid Bluetooth low energy/ultra-wideband (BLE/UWB) positioning systems. The proposed method adopts fingerprint crowdsourcing and radio map interpolation approaches. It consists in collecting signatures comprising user location calculated using an UWB subsystem and measured BLE signal levels. The recorded data is used to identify parameters of a log-distance path loss model and a Gaussian process regressor and interpolate a complete radio map. The presented concept was experimentally tested. The results have shown that the method allows for more accurate localisation than conventional received signal strength ranging based solution.

C	Khan, T			IEEE	Khan, Tareq			A Smart Wearable Gadget for Noninvasive Detection and Notification of Diaper Moister	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	International Conference on Electro Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)	MAY 03-05, 2018	Rochester, MI	IEEE		Bluetooth low energy; diaper moister; notification; smartphone app; temperature sensor		Wearing a wet diaper for a long time can be uncomfortable and cause health issues such as diaper rash. The best way to avoid diaper rash is to change the diaper often and as soon as possible after the baby urinates or passes stool. Daycare caregivers or parents sometimes forget or do not have time to manually check the diaper condition of the babies throughout the day. In this age of smart devices, many people are busy with their cell phones or tablets for social networking, texting, gaming, music etc. In this project, a novel wearable gadget is developed which sends an automatic notification to caregivers smart devices whenever the baby urinates. The proposed wearable detects urination event noninvasively by sensing the temperature rise on the outer surface of the diaper. The gadget is a small size, low power, low cost and reusable electronic device that is attached externally to the outer surface of the diaper using hook-and-loop fasteners. The gadget can be used with any disposable diaper, thus no change in the diaper production process or price increase is required. The smartphone app logs the urination events and creates databases and reports. This record can facilitate treating disease such as dehydration, where accurate previous records of urination are required. A prototype of the hardware gadget and a smartphone app is developed and tested.

We have also captured the Rib Cage (RC) and Abdomen (AB) movements using accelerometer sensors. In addition to measurement of phase shift between the chest wall compartments, the impacts of different body positions on AB and RC motions have been investigated. The performance of the presented system is evaluated and the average Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.14 is achieved for three breath timing variables. Moreover, the overall errors of phase angles for paradoxical and synchronous breath patterns are 0.25 degrees +/- 0.06 and 0.26 degrees +/- 6E-03, respectively. The system properly indicates a significant increase in the degree of ribcage and abdomen asynchrony in the paradoxical breathing compared to normal pattern.

This fact makes apparent the necessity of modernizing the road infrastructure, the signalling elements and the traffic management systems. Many initiatives have emerged around the term Intelligent Transport System (ITS) in order to define new scenarios and requirements for this kind of applications. We even have two main competing technologies for implementing Vehicular communication protocols (V2X), C-V2X and 802.11p, but neither of them is widely deployed yet. One of the main barriers for the massive adoption of those technologies is governance. Current solutions rely on the use of a public key infrastructure that enables secure collaboration between the different entities in the V2X ecosystem, but given its global scope, managing such infrastructure requires reaching agreements between many parties, with conflicts of interest between automakers and telecommunication operators. As a result, there are plenty of use cases available and two mature communication technologies, but the complexity at the business layer is stopping the drivers from taking advantage of ITS applications. Blockchain technologies are defining a new decentralized paradigm for most traditional applications, where smart contracts provide a straightforward mechanism for decentralized governance. In this work, we propose an approach for decentralized V2X (D-V2X) that does not require any trusted authority and can be implemented on top of any communication protocol. We also define a proof-of-concept technical architecture on top of a cheap and highly secure System-on-Chip (SoC) that could allow for massive adoption of D-V2X.

J	Huang, C; Zhuang, Y; Liu, H; Li, JY; Wang, W				Huang, Cheng; Zhuang, Yuan; Liu, Hao; Li, Jianyu; Wang, Wei			A Performance Evaluation Framework for Direction Finding Using BLE AoA/AoD Receivers	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Antenna arrays; Antenna measurements; Directive antennas; Transmitting antennas; Instruments; Frequency modulation; Internet of Things; Bluetooth low energy (BLE) Angle of Arrival (AoA); Angle of Departure (AoD) receiver (RX) test; direction finding (DF) test; phase difference test		Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has been significantly contributed to the Internet of Things applications due to its advantages, such as low power consumption and scalability. To further expand its applications, BLE has adopted the Angle of Arrival (AoA) and the angle of departure (AoD) to improve the accuracy in direction finding (DF). The AoA/AoD is calculated using the phase difference (PD) between slots in the received BLE data. The PD performance of BLE receiver (RX) in all directions should be evaluated in detail because it directly determines the accuracy of AoA/AoD. In the traditional test method, the reference PD is converted by an antenna array with switches, which is inaccurate due to the conversion errors and path mismatches. Moreover, because of the mechanical rotation of the turntable, the test processing is very time consuming. This article proposes a BLE test waveform generation method that directly includes the reference PD. A commonly used vector signal generator (VSG) is the only required instrument in the evaluation. The compact test setup not only eliminates the requirement of antenna array, switch, turntable, and anechoic chamber but also eliminates the measurement errors caused by these devices. After creating and downloading all BLE test waveforms with reference PD in the range of -180 degrees to 180 degrees by user-defined steps, the PD performance of BLE RX can be quickly evaluated by switching the test waveforms using commands or running them in the sequence mode. Furthermore, three enhanced test cases with automatic test procedures are proposed to evaluate the detailed PD accuracy of BLE RX under the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), carrier frequency offset, and modulation frequency deviation environments.

However, accurately identifying the patient's indoor location in a real-world complex environment, such as a hospital, is still a challenging problem, with interference and attenuation from patients, staff, walls and various electromagnetic sources (e.g., imaging devices). We present an indoor localization methodology that achieve a best-effort localization accuracy given the available sensors, (low-quality) motion data and computational platforms. First, we utilize machine learning methods to find a suitable accuracy/granularity balance and then proceed by training a localization model. Then, we apply a set of heuristics based on motion data to eliminate false location estimates. We validated of our approach in a real-life busy and noisy PED with a 92% accuracy.

The BLE neighbor discovery process (NDP) based on active scanning may be the core of multiple IoT applications in which a large and varying number of users/devices/tags must be detected in a short period of time. Minimizing the discovery latency and maximizing the number of devices that can be discovered in a limited time are challenging issues due to collisions between frames sent by advertisers and scanners. The mechanism for resolution of collisions between scanners has a great impact on the achieved performance, but backoff in NDP has been poorly studied so far. This paper includes a detailed analysis of backoff in NDP, identifies and studies the factors involved in the process, reveals the limitations and problems presented by the algorithm suggested by the specifications and proposes simple and practical adaptations on scanner functionality. They are easily compatible with the current definitions of the standard, which together with a new proposal for the backoff scheme, may significantly improve the discovery latencies and, thus, the probability of discovering a large number of devices in high density scenarios.

The latest CTC designs explore the PHY-layer to reach the standards' maximum rate, but leaving a critical gap to practicality - existing PHY-layer CTCs are commonly transmitter-side techniques requiring a high-end transmitter (with a high degree of freedom in signal manipulation) to emulate the receiver signal closely. This inherently limits the reverse direction (low-end to high-end) communication. We present XBee, a unique receiver-side CTC thatfi lls in the gap and makes a critical step towards achieving CTC bidirectionality. XBee is demonstrated as a ZigBee to BLE communication, where the key innovation lies in the unique mechanism of cross-technology decoding, or cross-decoding in short, which interprets a ZigBee frame only by carefully observing the bit patterns obtained at the BLE receiver. Technically, XBee counterintuitively explores the sampling offset to overcome the intrinsic challenge due to BLE's narrower bandwidth (1MHz) than ZigBee (2MHz). Extensive implementation and evaluation on USRP and commodity devices reaches 250 kbps under 85% reliability, a 15,000x improvement over state-ofthe-art ZigBee to BLE communication, and comparable with the latest PHY-layer CTCs to achieve CTC bidirectionality.

To reduce cellular tail energy use, existing solutions either require changing application behavior or assume the availability of low-level control of cellular interface (e.g., fast dormancy). We propose a collaborative cellular tail energy reduction approach for background traffic, which opportunistically discovers neighbors using low-power Bluetooth radio and shares their cellular bandwidth. Furthermore, we define a rigorous fairness notion by adapting the generalized processor sharing concept. Our sharing scheduling algorithm uses this notion to achieve substantial energy saving while ensuring fairness for participating phones and is also robust to whitewash attacks. Our evaluation demonstrates up to 90% saving for background traffic energy consumption in urban settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition, security features are required to secure data transmitted between the end devices and the server. In this study, we developed a secure multiprotocol gateway that supports for RF, ZigBee, BLE, and Ethernet protocols and utilizes TCP / IP protocols for advanced data processing after the gateway exit. Additionally, we added a data encryption algorithm for data security transmitted through the proposed gateway. To display the data the server receives, we added a dashboard to the gateway. The proposed multiprotocol gateway has been simulated using testbed environment in which the transmitted data was encrypted by default. The results showed that WiFi has the highest throughput compared to BLE and XBee, while the transmission delay tends to increase for all protocols but WiFi has the lowest delay compared to XBee and BLE.

Owing to the accompanying growth of the importance of privacy, a great deal of attention has focused on the issues of secure management and robust access control of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose the design of a blockchain connected gateway which adaptively and securely maintains user privacy preferences for IoT devices in the blockchain network. Individual privacy leakage can be prevented because the gateway effectively protects users' sensitive data from being accessed without their consent. A robust digital signature mechanism is proposed for the purposes of authentication and secure management of privacy preferences. Furthermore, we adopt the blockchain network as the underlying architecture of data processing and maintenance to resolve privacy disputes.

We employ the positioning data of users; thus, we avoid recording the action or any conversation pertaining to the users. We use the beacon signal to find a user's location and choose a subgroup, which is a temporary group obtained using the location of the users. The proposed method analyzes the familiarity using two different methods. The proximity-based method is used to calculate the familiarity based on the time for which the user has stayed in the subgroup. The direction-based method is used to calculate the familiarity based on the direction of each user in the subgroup. This study addressed situations arising in an event or a group activity in indoors to analyze the degree of familiarity by determining the location of a user.

J	Lo, NW; Yohan, A				Lo, Nai-Wei; Yohan, Alexander			BLE-Based Authentication Protocol for Micropayment Using Wearable Device	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Authentication; Bluetooth low energy; Physical unclonable function; Micropayment; Wearable device	INTERNET; SCHEME	Rapid growth of global wearable device market within the last 5 years shows the tremendous interest of modern society on environmental sensing technology to develop intelligent and convenient services for human beings. Wearable devices like smart watch and intelligent eyeglasses have been successfully deployed or associated to various application domains such as gamification of healthcare, real time location identification, mobile online games and health indicator monitoring. The idea of incorporating micropayment capability within wearable device has become a hot issue along with the market growth of wearable devices. Security strength, performance efficiency and deployment cost are the three major factors to develop a user-friendly wearable-device-oriented micropayment environment. As almost all wearable devices with screen display including smart watches and smartphones manufactured in recent years are equipped with Bluetooth communication module as a default deployment model; a Bluetooth-based authentication frontend is a reasonable choice for a user-friendly wearable-device-oriented micropayment system in terms of the reduction of system deployment cost. In this paper, a robust and lightweight BLE-based authentication protocol to support wearable-device-oriented micropayment system is proposed. The proposed authentication protocol generates unique and secure session key for each communicating session utilizing Physical Unclonable Function. Security analysis is conducted to evaluate security strength of the proposed protocol. Performance comparison among existing protocols shows that the proposed protocol is superior to other solutions.

This paper demonstrates a discrete level real time encryption system using analog circuitry on a printed circuit board. The encryption system uses op amps, multipliers and resistors to implement the encryption.

J	Eras, L; Dominguez, F; Martinez, C				Eras, Leonardo; Dominguez, Federico; Martinez, Caril			Viability characterization of a proof-of-concept Bluetooth mesh smart building application	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Review						Bluetooth Mesh; wireless mesh networks; smart buildings		Bluetooth low energy is an almost ubiquitous technology currently embedded in billions of power-constrained Internet of Things devices around the world. The Bluetooth mesh profile, released by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group in July 2017, allows Bluetooth low energy devices to form a mesh network, further enabling smart home and building applications where long-range connectivity is required. However, the current release of Bluetooth mesh profile still has power and deployment constraints that limit its applicability. To explore the viability of Bluetooth mesh profile in home/building automation applications, we built the Smart Doorbell: a proof-of-concept Bluetooth mesh profile-based visitor notification system for office spaces. The Smart Doorbell was implemented using a mesh network topology with nodes distributed across office building floors, serving as a real Internet of Things deployment and as a testbed for mesh network protocols. Similar Bluetooth mesh profile evaluations found in literature use mostly development kits and/or synthetic traffic in artificial settings; we contribute by using the Smart Doorbell, a system as close as possible to a minimum viable product, to evaluate power consumption and responsiveness as a proxy for product viability. This article presents the architecture of the Smart Doorbell, the viability evaluation results, and a direct comparison with FruityMesh, a competing Bluetooth low energy mesh network protocol. Overall, the fact that Bluetooth mesh profile devices can directly communicate with a user's mobile phone (using Bluetooth low energy) considerably eases deployment and provisioning. However, the use of flooding to forward messages across the mesh network increases power consumption, precluding the use of battery-powered nodes on the network's backbone and severely limiting the applicability of Bluetooth mesh profile in building automation.

PD exhibits a physical occurrence where a localized electrical discharge happens in insulation materials. This phenomenon causes damage to the insulating parts and, in various circumstances, leads to complete insulation breakdown. As a consequence, it can produce more costly outcomes such as abrupt outages or lost production. Therefore, PD detection plays a vital role in preventing insulation failure. In this work, we propose a system that utilizes heterogeneous sensors for the PD detection along with multi-sensor interface, real-time advanced denoise processing, flexible system operation, and Bluetooth-low-energy (BLE)-based ad hoc communication. Among the variety of heterogeneous sensors, several are developed by the application of nanomaterials and nanotechnology, thus outperforming the regular types. The proposed system successfully identifies the presence of PD from sensor signals using a microprocessor-based processing system and effectively performs an advanced denoising technique based on the wavelet transform through field-programmable-gate-array (FPGA)-based programmable logics. With the development of the system, we aim to achieve a solution with low cost, high flexibility and efficiency, and ease of deployment for the monitoring of power grid systems.

To support locating applications in indoor environments, numerous systems with different deployment costs and positioning accuracies have been developed over the past decade. One useful method, based on received signal strength (RSS), provides a set of signal transmission access points. However, compiling a remeasurement RSS database involves a high cost, which is impractical in dynamically changing environments, particularly in highly crowded areas. In this study, we propose a dynamic estimation resampling method for certain locations chosen from a set of remeasurement fingerprinting databases. Our proposed method adaptively applies different, newly updated and offline fingerprinting points according to the temporal and spatial strength of the location. To achieve accuracy within a simulated area, the proposed method requires approximately 3% of the feedback to attain a double correctness probability comparable to similar methods; in a real environment, our proposed method can obtain excellent 1 m accuracy errors in the positioning system.

Researchers have addressed the problem of automatic floor map construction in indoor environments using various modalities, such as inertial sensors, Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting and video cameras. Considering that some of these techniques are unavailable or impractical to implement in residential environments, in this paper, we focus on using RF signals to predict the number of walls between a wearable device and an access point. Using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on two data sets; a system-level data set of Bluetooth packets, and measurements on the signal attenuation, we construct wall prediction models that yield up to 91% identification rate. As a proof-of-concept, we also use the wall prediction models to infer the floor plan of a smart home deployment in a real residential environment.

In this context, we propose EEG-over-BLE, a novel architecture for multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring systems. Basically, the proposed architecture combines Bluetooth technology with a near-lossless EEG compression algorithm and a simple channel encoding scheme in order to largely reduce power consumption. Here we present the results of a detailed simulation campaign aimed at assessing the performance of the proposed architecture in terms of energy consumption, packet loss rate and end-to-end latency. According to simulation results, when EEG-over-BLE sensor nodes are powered with commercial small form factor batteries, their lifetime is over 66 days. At the same time, a packet loss rate lower than 0.1% and a latency below 40 ms are achieved.

It is becoming increasingly relevant for vehicles to become aware of their surroundings. Therefore, having knowledge of nearby Bluetooth devices, both inside and outside other vehicles, can provide the listening vehicles with enough data to learn about their environment. In this paper, we collect and analyze a dataset of Bluetooth Classic (BC) and Low Energy (BLE) discoveries. We evaluate their respective characteristics and ability to provide context-aware information from a vehicular perspective. By taking a look at data about the encountered devices, such as GPS location, quantity, quality of signal and device class information, we infer distinctive behaviors between BC and BLE relative to context and application. For this purpose, we propose a set a features to train a classifier for the recognition of different driving environments (i.e. road classes) from Bluetooth discovery data alone. Comparing the performance of our classifier with different sampling parameters, the presented results indicate that, with our feature selection, we are able to predict with reasonable confidence up to three classes (Highway, City, Extra-Urban) by using only discovery data and no geographical information. This outcome gives promising results targeted at low energy and privacy-friendly applications and can open up a wide range of research directions.

By using custom firmware for microchips like the ESP32, it was possible to build custom trackable accessories similar to an Apple AirTag in size and functionality. OpenHaystack Mobile is a cross-platform mobile application that runs on Android and iOS. It extends previous work, which was tied to macOS, to be available to more users. It provides BLE-based location tracking functionality based on Apple's Find My network. We built a cross-platform capable app by using the Flutter framework for the user interface and the cryptographic operations. The user experience is improved compared to a desktop-based app because it allows tracking lost valuables anywhere. Furthermore, the app allows directly route users to lost devices with smartphone navigation apps like Google Maps.

A method for mobile device positioning using a sensor network of BLE beacons, approximation of the RSSI value and artificial neural networks	COMPUTER OPTICS			Russian	Article						indoor positioning; bluetooth low energy; Kalman filter; approximation; artificial neural network		The paper considers the development of a method for positioning a mobile device using a sensor network of BLE-beacons, the approximation of RSSI values and artificial neural networks. The aim of the work is to develop a method for positioning small-scale industrial mechanization equipment for building unmanned systems for product movement tracking. The work is divided into four main parts: data synthesis, signal filtering, selection of BLE beacons, translation of the RSSI values into a distance, and multilateration. A simplified Kalman filter is proposed for filtering the input signal to suppress Gaussian noise. A description of two approaches to translating the RSSI value into a distance is given: an exponential approximation function with a coefficient of determination of 0.6994 and an artificial feedforward neural network. A comparison of the results of these approaches is carried out on several test samples: a training one, a test sample at a known distance (0 - 50 meters) and a test sample at an unknown distance (60 - 100 meters). The artificial neural network is shown to perform better in all experiments, except for the test sample at a known distance (0 - 50 meters), for which the r.m.s. error is higher by 0.02 m(2) than that for the approximation function, which can be neglected. An algorithm for positioning a mobile device based on the multilateration method is proposed. Experimental studies of the developed method have shown that the positioning error does not exceed 0.9 meters in a 5x5.5-m room under monitoring. The positioning accuracy of a mobile device using the proposed method in the experiment is 40.9 % higher. Experimental studies are also conducted in a 58.4x4.5 m room, showing more accurate results compared to similar studies.	[Astafiev, A., V; Zhiznyakov, A. L.; Demidov, A.

The environmental factors of ambient light, ambient temperature, ambient noise levels, barometric pressure and relative humidity are recorded by the smart collar system in addition to behavioral information about barking incidences and activity levels. The data are collected from the sensors and transmitted via Bluetooth to the handler's smartphone where the custom app also acquires GPS positioning using the on-board smartphone sensors. The stored data on the smartphone are uploaded to the IBM Cloud once the user is connected to a WiFi network. The low power design of the smart collar system permits it to be used continuously for 27 hours with a 290 mAh lithium polymer battery. The cost of the system is low enough to let the handlers have multiple collars and exchange it if needed or recharge it overnight when not in use. This system is currently being scaled up to be tested on hundreds of canine puppies by a preeminent guide dog school in the US. As a result, the design emphasis here has been on the cost and power reduction, comfortable ergonomics, user friendliness, and robustness of data streaming. We expect the system to provide continuous quantitative data for improving guide dog training programs in addition to contributing the well-being of other working dogs in the future.

Low-Power Multi-Lead Wearable ECG System With Sensor Data Compression	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy (BLE); electrocardiogram (ECG)-sensing electrodes; lossless compression algorithm	QRS DETECTION; SCHEME	This study proposes a low-power wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition system for monitoring human health in daily life. A flexible sensing electrode was designed to replace traditional silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes for measuring ECG signals from leads I, II, and V1. The traditional multi-lead-wired ECG detector limits the movements and activities of the patient and requires medical staff to assist in collecting ECG signals. The portable ECG acquisition device proposed in this article is not only comfortable to wear but also convenient for patients to use anytime, anywhere. To increase the sampling rate of the device to obtain more ECG signal information, this study proposes an innovative Huffman lossless ECG data compression algorithm based on variable-word length coding (VLC). This algorithm can efficiently realize data compression and reduce power consumption. It makes the whole system operate continuously for a long period of time and acquire abundant ECG information, which is helpful for clinical diagnosis. Experimental results show that when the sampling rate is 400 Hz, the working current is only 3.64 mA, and the compression ratio (CR) of the device can reach 2.38.

It has transformed its techniques by using intelligent gadgets that can be acquainted with patients in different configurations. The data obtained from devices like pulse rate monitors, weighing scales, blood glucose measuring devices, etc. is to be stocked and tracked as awareness of health statistics is vital for all. A hefty portion of these measures requires a follow-off with a specialist. This commences the preference of using IoT based smart devices to deliver more valuable data to the patient and drop off the necessity for direct patient-doctor interaction. Improving the standard of service, it brings particularly high value for the patients requiring constant supervision and quick data access and analysis. This paper will demonstrate automatic communication between the smart devices and android mobile application via Bluetooth and data storage on Cloud. Also, it shows automatic control over oxygen cylinder using mobile app for admitted patients who require supplementary oxygen. Thus, our system serves the purpose of minimizing doctors' efforts and providing seamless experience to the patient with IoT, Cloud and Wireless Technology like Bluetooth helping in saving millions of lives.

Central device samples data from channels and supplies energy for the channels. It transfers data further to a device providing the user with graphical interface. Connection from central device to user interface device can be with or without wires. Very common drawback of such systems is that the wires limit patient movements; make EMG measurements relatively uncomfortable and they are not available for personal use because of relatively high prices. The goal of this project was to design, construct and test a compact-size, wireless and surface-electrode EMG measurement system. The intention is that device could be used as a single channel wireless EMG acquisition system which uses smartphone as a graphical user interface. Due to its simplicity and low price it is hoped to be available for home, everyday, personal use.

There are some devices on the market, that are designed for measuring of human body motion. Some of them can be used for research, allowing user to change settings of sensors or data transmission using their software development kits. But the aim of this project was to develop the data measurement unit and control every acquisition process inside, with possibility to extend the device in the future. Also, segments of this complex device can be used in other custom applications. Therefore, a multipurpose device for analysis of human body movement was developed.

Rectangular Antenna Arrays guarantee good performances, both in azimuth and elevation in the Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. This paper studies the eight antenna rectangular array topology, called URA8. Historically, MUSIC has been the most used algorithm on this type of array. Unfortunately in HAAT real-time applications, where it is essential to have a fast response from the DoA Locator, MUSIC, due to its high computational complexity in the peak searching over the pseudo-spectrum, may be inadequate for the scope. This paper proposes an innovative approach to reduce the complexity of this peak-searching phase: instead of only one peak-search over the complete azimuth-elevation hemisphere, we propose a two step search, the first with a reduced resolution and the latter with a fine resolution inside a proper confidence region, found in the first step. The proposed method ensures a good trade-off between computational complexity and detection performances: it turns out to approximately 6 times faster than the classic MUSIC, maintaining the same precision.

J	Bui, NT; Vo, TH; Kim, BG; Oh, J				Ngoc Thang Bui; Tan Hung Vo; Kim, Byung-Gak; Oh, Junghwan			Design of a Solar-Powered Portable ECG Device with Optimal Power Consumption and High Accuracy Measurement	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; ECG monitoring; solar energy harvesting; low power consumption	POINT TRACKING; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	One of the best ways to monitor the health of the heart is to regularly record its electrical activity by using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Abnormal ECG signals may indicate conditions such as heart attack, arrhythmia, or heart defects. There are many ECG devices available which can detect and amplify this differential biological signal from the heart, allowing a lot of information to be collected quickly. The ECG is often small and easy to use, but its power is supplied from regular batteries, which need to be replaced after a certain period of use. This causes discomfort for elderly users. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we aim to develop a solar-powered, portable Bluetooth device for ECG measurements. The device can be interfaced with smartphones or other wireless devices via Bluetooth by a distance up to 100 m. The ECG device was designed to use solar energy, which is also the main power source. Following the solar energy harvesting circuit is a solar panel with an output voltage of 2.4 V and a power out of 0.25 W. We optimized the design to have a very low power consumption and in sleep mode the current consumption is only around 40 mu A. The device was designed with 24-bit resolution and a sampling frequency of up to 2133 Hz, which can allow high accuracy ECG measurements. The device is not only used for heart rate monitoring, but it can also assist doctors in analyzing ECG signals with a high accuracy via embedded operating software.

Utilizing mobile beacons in IPS environment has made localization more accurate and cost-effective. This paper proposes an Filtered RSSI and Beacon Weight Approach (FRBW) based on improved Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values using a Kalman filter. This algorithm takes both the distance and improved RSSI measurements between beacon nodes into consideration. Kalman filter applied on the RSSI measurements that eliminate noise of the signal and then applied on FRBW positioning algorithm. The proposed algorithm was applied using eight beacons. The results show that this FRBW approach has better positioning accuracy and minimum location error, and can be applied in IoT applications in smart city.

There is a wide array of PDTs that a common person uses frequently including Automated Teller Machines (ATM), interactive kiosks, self-service kiosks and so on to accomplish numerous day-to-day tasks. Improving the usability of PDTs has been targeted from various aspects by Human Computer Interaction researchers. Research in this area has spanned from using multimodal approaches, revised guidelines for kiosk construction, navigation restructuring, to alternative methods of user authentication to provide an improved and enhanced user-experience. The main issue with the solutions provided to this day is that they all target improving the device. Providing a personalized solution remains unanswered. The widespread use of smartphones and tablets has given rise to the next generation of e-commerce commonly known as m-commerce. Although m-commerce have made huge strides in the areas of mobile payments, the area of making use of mobile technology with public access terminals is still limited. As technology edges towards cardless and contactless transactions, we propose to provide an accessible and scalable solution to the use of PDTs using proximity-aware technology. The main objective of the work presented in this paper is to identify and discuss the feasibility of using proximity-aware solutions to address the security, privacy and accessibility concerns when using PDTs.

At the same time, security and privacy concerns regarding IoT technologies are also attracting significant attention given the risks that are inherently associated with the respective devices and their numerous applications, ranging from healthcare, smart homes, and cities, to intelligent transportation systems and industrial automation. Considering the still heterogeneous nature of the majority of IoT protocols, a major concern is to find common references for investigating and analyzing their security and privacy threats. To this end, and on top of the current literature, this work provides a comprehensive, vis-a-vis comparison of the security aspects of the thus far most widespread IoT Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols, namely BLE, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Thread, and EnOcean.

New enhancements over BLE have focused on supporting mesh network topology. Compared to other mesh networks, BLE mesh has only considered a managed flooding protocol in its first version. Managed flooding may generally seem inefficient in many contexts, but it is a high desirable option when data transmission is urgent, the network is small or its configuration changes in a very dynamic way. Knowing the interest to many application contexts, this paper analyses the impact of tweaking several features over the reliability and efficiency of the mesh network. These features are configured and controlled in different layers: message repetition schemes, the transmission randomization, the election of a scheme based on an acknowledged or unacknowledged transmission, etc. In order to estimate the real performance of a mesh network deployment, this paper evaluates the effects of the interaction of the chosen parameters, their appropriate adjustment in relation with the characteristics of real implementations and the true overhead related to the whole protocol stack. The paper identifies configuration challenges, proposes network tuning criteria and outlines possible standard improvements. For this purpose, a detailed assessment on the implementation and execution of real devices has been performed with their chipset limitations.

Although living alone allows more independence, it raises the risk of serious or even fatal accidents. To help assist those who live alone, we propose a monitoring system to detect indoor position by using a smartwatch and beacons, which are effective and low cost, easy to install, convenient, and unobtrusive in daily life. Data mining techniques were applied to classify indoor positioning zones. A noise reduction process combining two data smoothing techniques was incorporated. The best model for indoor positioning was chosen from various algorithms and different window sizes of data to achieve the best usage in a real-time classification. Both the number and positioning of beacons were also considered in this research. Various useful screens with easy-to-understand visualizations are provided for monitoring subject behaviors and time spent in certain areas, giving a summary of indoor positioning. Finally, the system allows users to manage indoor positioning by combining the marked spots as zoning areas.

Model-based IPSs have the advantage of not having an exhausting training and signal characterization of the environment, as required by the fingerprint technique. However, most model-based IPSs are done using fixed model parameters, treating the whole scenario as having a uniform signal propagation. This might work for most small scale experiments, but not for larger scenarios. In this paper, we propose PoDME (Positioning using Dynamic Model Estimation), a model-based IPS that uses dynamic parameters that are estimated based on the location the signal was sent. More specifically, we use the set of anchor nodes that received the signal sent by the mobile node and their signal strengths, to estimate the best local values for the log-distance model parameters. Also, since our solution depends highly on the selected anchor nodes to use on the position computation, we propose a novel method for choosing the three best anchor nodes. Our method is based on several data analysis executed on a large-scale, Bluetooth-based, real-world experiment and it chooses not only the nearest anchor but also the ones that benefit our least-square-based position computation. Our solution achieves a position estimation error of 3 m, which is 17% better than a fixed-parameters model from the literature.

In this regard, the paper proposes a novel Event-Triggered (ET) IMU monitoring/communication strategy for indoor localization in IoT applications. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work to develop ET methodologies within this context where communication only occurs when specific events are identified via a local triggering mechanism implemented at the sensor level. Different experimental scenarios are implemented illustrating effectiveness of the proposed ET-based IMU communication.

Based on the analysis of the signal strength of adjacent reference points in the fingerprint database, the methods for the eight-neighborhood template matching and generation were studied. In this study, the indoor environment was divided into four quadrants for each access point and the expected values of the received signal strength indication (RSSI) difference between the center points and their eight-neighborhoods in different quadrants were chosen as the generation parameters. Then different templates were generated for different access points, and the unknown point was located by the Euclidean distance for the correlation of RSSI between each template and its coverage area in the fingerprint database. With the spatial correlation of fingerprint data taken into account, the influence of abnormal fingerprint on locating accuracy is reduced. The experimental results show that the locating error is 1.0 m, which is about 0.2 m less than both K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN) algorithms.

New commodity objects and wearables implementing Bluetooth Smart technology (Low Energy) are released everyday. In particular, the ever increasing number of discoverable devices both inside and outside a populated area gives us an encouraging insight on future research directions for this technology. In this paper, based on a sensing system developed as an Android application, we evaluate Bluetooth Classic and Low Energy discovery characteristics from a vehicular perspective. By recording information about devices nearby (e.g. the number of discovered devices, their signal strength, manufacturer information) and the GPS location we can derive interesting information about a driver's situation, as well as his/her environment. Presented results indicate that the amount of discovered devices and signal strengths are dependent on velocity and road category. Finally, future work and discussions address potential use-case applications based only on Bluetooth discovery, such as low energy and privacy friendly road and traffic context awareness.

Most of the efficient IPS methods utilize radio-based solutions to meet the accuracy requirement of indoor LBS. Typically fingerprinting localization is realized, which requires a site survey process where radio signatures of a localization area are annotated with their actual recorded locations. The site survey is time-consuming and labor-intensive that intensifies practical limits and challenges in realizing a reliable and scalable IPS. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing-based approach to acquire the training data set for Gaussian process regression (GPR). In particular, we suggest combining access point (AP) proximity information and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) to collect labeled data without any human intervention. The crowdsourced training data are fed to model a Gaussian process, which predicts the mean RSS and its corresponding variance across the testbed. To validate the proposed method, we compared the predicted data with the manually measured one and utilized the predicted data for localization using weighted k-nearest neighbor (Wk-NN) and maximum likelihood (ML) based fingerprinting localization. Experimental results obtained by real field deployment show that the average difference between the predicted RSS and manually measured RSS is 3.87 dBm and 80% of the localization estimation error are below 5.5m.

We present a set of these pieces, including a gateway, four hardware building blocks, multiple sensor platforms, an indoor localization system, and software for connecting users and devices. Each piece plays an integral role towards enabling applications, from facilitating rapid development of wireless smart devices to composing data streams and services from a diverse set of components. By providing layered interoperable systems, our toolkit offers cohesive support for moving beyond single-device, cloud-centric applications-typical in today's IoT landscape-and towards richer applications that incorporate multiple data streams, human interaction, cloud processing, location awareness, multiple communication protocols, historical data, access control, and on-demand user interfaces. To show how the pieces in the toolkit cooperate, we demonstrate a location-based access control application where a user's smartphone can control a room's lighting, but only from within the room. Further, data streams from the phone and nearby sensors are used to provide a constant lighting service which attempts to maintain a user-set brightness under variable external lighting conditions.

Two-factor authentication is one way to mitigate these issues, but suffers from low user acceptance due to (perceived) additional effort. We introduce SecuriCast, a method to provide two-factor authentication using WebBluetooth as a secondary channel between an unmodified web browser and the user's smartphone. Depending on the usage scenario and the desired level of security, no device switch and only minimal additional interaction is required from the user. We analyse SecuriCast based on the framework by Bonneau et al., briefly report on results from a user study with 30 participants demonstrating performance and perceived usability of SecuriCast, and discuss possible attack scenarios and extensions.

In nursing homes, carers need to make a daily report for each resident aiming to improve his/her quality of life. However, in the present understaffed situation, it is difficult and burdensome for carers to record the resident's activity in detail since each carer needs to take care of several residents at the same time. In this paper, we propose an automatic daily report generation system which can monitor the activity of multiple residents in nursing homes. Knowing that important activities such as toilet, bathing, rehabilitation and so on take place in specific areas in a nursing home, it is possible to record residents' activities by tracking their stay areas and movement between the areas within the day. Our proposed system estimates stay areas of multiple residents by machine learning for RSSI values that are sent from BITE beacons attached to residents and received at BEE scanners deployed over multiple areas, and records activities of the residents determined based on their estimated stay areas. The proposed system can also output a daily report of each resident based on the recorded data.

In this context, the Internet of Things technologies could allow to analyze the elderly's behavioral in an unobtrusive way, thus helping to prevent Mild Cognitive Impairment and frailty problems. To this end, this work aims to define a reliable system for controlling the position and the body motility of the elderly in low-cost and low-power way. Movements and body motility are, indeed, good indicators of behavioral changes.

One of the main challenges that exists with these platforms in multi-residential houses is activity labeling. As most of the activity sensors do not provide any information regarding the identity of the person who triggers them, it is difficult to label the sensor events in multi-residential smart homes. To deal with this challenge, individual localization in different areas can be a promising solution. The localization information can be used to automatically label the activity sensor data to individuals. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a promising technology for this application due to how easy it is to implement and its low energy footprint. In this approach, individuals wear a tag that broadcasts its unique identity (ID) in certain time intervals, while fixed scanners listen to the broadcasting packet to localize the tag and the individual. However, the localization accuracy of this method depends greatly on different settings of broadcasting signal strength, and the time interval of BLE tags. To achieve the best localization accuracy, this paper studies the impacts of different advertising time intervals and power levels, and proposes an efficient and applicable algorithm to select optimal value settings of BLE sensors. Moreover, it proposes an automatic activity labeling method, through integrating BLE localization information and ambient sensor data. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed structure is also demonstrated in a real multi-resident smart home scenario.

Many IoT devices are equipped with restricted microcontrollers that do not have efficient security systems. One such device is a beacon that emits Bluetooth low-energy signals. Applications using beacons are novel, but they lack security mechanisms due to the Bluetooth low-energy specification and the limited resources of beacons. This paper discusses the main security threats faced by applications using Bluetooth beacons. In addition, a security protocol based on lightweight cryptography is proposed for the establishment of a shared secret key and the generation of ephemeral identifiers as a countermeasure against security threats in these types of applications.

Performance analysis of fingerprinting indoor positioning methods with BLE	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fingerprinting; BLE; Indoor positioning; Support Vector Machines (SVM); Multilayer Perceptron (MLP); Weighted k-Nearest Neighbours (Wk-NN)	SIGNAL STRENGTH; NEURAL-NETWORK; LOCALIZATION; SYSTEM	Indoor positioning with smartphone-compatible technologies has fostered much research attention in recent years. In this context, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) reveals a good performance for this type of task. It offers more flexibility and better achievements when compared with similar systems based on IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) technology, especially for fingerprinting-based positioning systems. The literature on these systems is rich and growing; however, not all its possible algorithms have been tested and compared under similar conditions for this emergence technology. This work presents a thorough analysis of the state of the art on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) algorithms used for fingerprinting systems. Based on this study, a novel scheme for fingerprinting methods classification is proposed. Then, a performance comparison between the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) databases is carried out, assessing training time, parameter optimization, computational time, and positioning accuracy. For the sake of completeness, a new database is provided and compared with the others to analyze how the environment can affect the accuracy of each method. The results show that those techniques based on the Weighted k-Nearest Neighbours (Wk-NN) algorithm perform better on average for large scale deployments; besides, they do not require any previous training and consume less time to optimize their parameters. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines (SVM) provides the best accuracy with less computational and training time in small environments.

The goal is to investigate the physical layer and establish an antenna recommendation system for a specific harsh environment, i.e., an engine compartment of a vehicle. We propose the usage of electromagnetic (EM) and ray tracing simulations as a computationally cost-effective method to establish such a recommendation system, which we test by means of an experimental testbed-or test environment-that consists of both a physical, as well as its identical simulation, model. A pool of antennas is evaluated to identify and verify antenna behavior and properties at specified positions in the harsh environment. We use a vector network analyzer (VNA) for accurate measurements and a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for a first estimation of system performance. Our analysis of the experimental measurements and its EM simulation counterparts shows that both types of data lead to equivalent antenna recommendations at each of the defined positions and experimental conditions. This evaluation and verification process by measurements on an experimental testbed is important to validate the antenna recommendation process. Our results indicate that-with properly characterized antennas-such measurements can be substituted with EM simulations on an accurate EM model, which can contribute to dramatically speeding up the antenna positioning and selection process.

Bluetooth LE supports the star network topology; however the tree network topology is not supported. To implement a tree topology, three different nodes are designed: the central or the root node which collects all the data, the intermediate node formed by combining two Bluetooth devices in one package and the leaf node which is the lowest node of the network. Important WSN parameters such as ranges between nodes, power consumption and latency are evaluated. According to the test results, it can be concluded that the tree topology can be used with Bluetooth low energy for the purposes of range extension, extending the number of network nodes or even just data processing by the central node.

The proposed system uses a SimpleLink Bluetooth SensorTag and a mobile application to collect environmental data from a subject's surroundings on a daily basis.

An enhanced version of a tongue-operated robotic rehabilitation system is presented for accelerating the rate of improvement in the upper extremity motor functions for patients with severe hemiparesis following stroke. A new rehabilitation robot, called Hand Mentor ProTM (HM), was utilized by reading its pressure and joint angle sensors, combined with control commands from the Tongue Drive System (TDS) to enable both isometric and isotonic target-tracking tasks in a coordinated tongue-hand rehabilitation paradigm. Preliminary results in 3 healthy subjects who performed a sinusoidal target tracking task demonstrated the TDS-HM system functionality in hand-operated isometric, hand-operated isotonic, tongue-operated isotonic discrete control and tongue-operated isotonic proportional control modes with average normalized root-mean-square errors of 0.058 +/- 0.023, 0.043 +/- 0.011, 0.184 +/- 0.087, and 0.148 +/- 0.075, respectively.

Rather than prior arts that rely on power-hungry resistive/current combiners or the IQ-assisted binary-search algorithm with large power T&H circuits for the reference generation, this design benefits from the fully dynamic power characteristic of the time-domain operation, thus leading to an energy-efficient phase ADC design. By introducing several on-chip calibration techniques, the design achieves good robustness with the proposed time-domain operation. The prototype is fabricated in the standard 65-nm CMOS technology, achieving an ENOB of 3.42 bits at 1 MS/s with near Nyquist input, while dissipating 7 mu W from a 1-V supply. It leads to a 1.36-pJ/conversion-step Walden Figure of Merit at Nyquist input (FoM@Nyquist).

To address this problem, we propose to use the approach of combining dynamic collection of fingerprint samples with Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation. Specifically, the raw sparse fingerprint database is constructed from a small number of fingerprints collected on a few paths, in which the pedestrian track correction algorithm improves the validity and accuracy of the sparse fingerprint database. Then, the RBF interpolation approach is applied to enrich the sparse fingerprint database, in which the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the free shape parameter and the cut-off radius is determined according to the experimental results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach guarantees high interpolation and localization accuracy and also significantly reduces the effort of manual collection of fingerprint samples.

Electromagnetic (EM) simulations are essential and inevitable for modern LC oscillator design. Although EM-simulators provide high accuracy, the EM-simulation time is very long when metal-oxide-metal (MoM) capacitors are present. The proposed frame-based EM-simulation can significantly reduce the EM-simulation time even in the presence of MoM capacitors without influencing the accuracy. To verify the proposed method, a DCO was fabricated using a 55-nm CMOS process. Measurements of the DCO are in good agreement with the frame-based post-layout simulation results. In addition, the DCO has good performances with a low power consumption of approximately 0.68 mW.

In this work a strapdown INS (SINS) in terms of Inertial Navigation System is discussed. INS is an electronic device, containing an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), implementing a Dead Reckoning (DR) algorithm. This algorithm estimates position, velocity and orientation utilizing readings from motion sensors. The logic behind DR algorithm is to continually adding detected changes from the sensors to its previously calculated results. This is the main reason why INS is limited to measure relative position and orientation. Thus the accuracy of the propagated position depends heavily on the quality of the initial conditions. In addition, if absolute position or orientation updates are obtained by another sensor source at a high rate, the INS can be used to deliver high precision positions. In this paper, an INS fused with the new Bluetooth v4.0 technology is described.

There are various treatment methods exist for this condition both invasive and non-invasive, but they all have their weaknesses and strengths. Electrical stimulation method seems to be the most promising non-invasive method in terms of efficiency and adherence rate. This study introduces a low- cost, easy-to-use and wireless novel device to treat obstructive sleep apnea based on electrical stimulation method. The developed device uses an accelerometer to track respiration and apnea episodes and when an apnea episode is detected delivers a small electric current to dilator muscles to make them regain their muscle tone, thus treating obstructive sleep apnea. The device also communicates with a smartphone application to keep a recording of respiration and apnea data to enable further studying of data by medical professionals and researchers.

This information is useful in dwindling unnecessary energy usage, such as consumption in unoccupied spaces or energy-wasting due to unnecessarily active appliances. We present an empirical experiment on office occupancy detection using simple office sensors. We choose generic power meters and mobile phones. First, we classify beacon signals received by mobile phones into a room location. A workspace map is assumed to be available to facilitate the mapping between room locations and the occupancy state of users' workspace. Second, we infer the individual occupancy state utilizing the aggregated electricity consumption of occupant-related devices (i.e., monitors) in shared offices. The later solution helps to keep costs and intrusiveness level low compared to deploying a power meter for each device or user. We experiment in an work environment with two shared offices, a personal office, and a social corner involving five volunteers. Given the acquired data, three techniques based on machine learning, optimization, and probabilistic approach are implemented and compared to evaluate their performance. The results indicate that localization and occupancy based on beaconing works best for three of the five volunteers, reaching 95% F-measure. Further findings shows that occupancy inference based on the aggregated power consumption performs well for the four volunteers when using Decision Tree classification, reaching more than 90% F-measure. Our effort on the fusion of two modalities gives a positive result for all five volunteers, ranging from 92% to 99% F-measure.

J	Pu, YC; You, PC				Pu, Yu-Chi; You, Pei-Chun			Indoor positioning system based on BLE location fingerprinting with classification approach	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Location fingerprinting; k-nearest neighbor; Weighted k-nearest neighbor		Position estimation is an important technique for location-based services. Many services and applications, such as navigation assistance, surveillance of patients and social networking, have been developed based on users' position. Although the GPS plays an important role in positioning systems, its signal strength is extremely weak inside buildings. Thus, other sensing devices are necessary to improve the accuracy of indoor localisation. In the past decade, researchers have developed a series of indoor positioning technologies based on the received signal strength (RSS) of WiFi, ZigBee or Bluetooth devices under the infrastructure of wireless sensor network for location estimation. We can compute the distance of the devices by measuring their RSS, but the correctness of the result is unsatisfactory because the radio signal interference is a considerable issue and the indoor radio propagation is too complicated to model. Using the location fingerprint to estimate a target position is a feasible strategy because the location fingerprint records the characteristics of the signals and the signal strength is related to the space relation. This type of algorithm estimates the location of a target by matching online measurements with the closest a-priori location fingerprints. The matching or classification algorithm is a key issue in the correctness of location fingerprinting. In this paper, we propose an effective location fingerprinting algorithm based on the general and weighted k-nearest neighbour algorithms to estimate the position of the target node. The grid points are trained with an interval of 2 m, and the estimated position error is about 1.8 m. Thus, the proposed method is low computation consumption, and with an acceptable accuracy.

Existing solutions use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for CTC modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10 b/s). Our approach, called BlueBee, explores the dense PHY-layer information for CTC by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames with the Bluetooth radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance and transparency for its only modifying the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at either the Bluetooth sender or the ZigBee receiver. Our implementation on both USRP and commodity devices shows that BlueBee can achieve standard ZigBee bit rate of 250 kb/s at more than 99% accuracy, which is over 10 000x faster than the state-of-the-art packet-level CTC technologies.

The main idea hereby developed is to start from a specific set of requirements (given by the selected telecommunications standards) in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) and blocker mask scenario in frequency domain, and to finally achieve a certain set of specifications for each stage in the receiver chain (i.e., LNA, mixer, baseband and ADC). The proposed system-level design algorithm allowsfixing the receiver specifications-per-stage with a reduced set of equations and successive iterations. Moreover, an optimum design for baseband section (i.e., complex-filter and the ADC) is also found, by achieving an optimum trade-or between-filter order and ADC equivalent-number-of-bits (ENOB). In order to validate the hereby proposed algorithm, a low-energy Bluetooth low-IF receiver has been modeled and simulated (by Simulink), and extensive time-domain simulation results have been provided, complying with the expected Bluetooth standard signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR).

The advancement of sensor technology allows us to quickly measure our posture in every scene using consumer-grade devices such as a wrist-worn type tracking sensors, smartphones, and shoes embedded with several kinds of sensors. It is not difficult to detect correct postures of athletes who can train at fully equipped facilities. However, for ordinary users, it is necessary to use a combination of such consumer portable devices for checking proper postures during daily exercise. In this study, we present a posture detection system using sensors embedded in consumer portable devices, for the purpose of posture checking. Experiments are performed to illustrate the feasibility of our system by the use of some exercise motions.

Such platform is useful to support an innovative ICT-based application of the Chronic Care Model (CCM). The platform exploits wearable sensors, a BT/BLE connectivity to the local gateway and then a connection, using standard formats and cyber-secure protocols, to a server-based application and repository. The platform allows clinicians and practitioners to realize aggravations and act promptly, before they become irreversible and lead to hospitalization. The system also implements data analysis, by processing multiple parameters in parallel. As well as monitoring the state of health, the proposed telemedicine platform can be also used to monitor the emotional and psychological state of the patient.

BLE devices are designed to maximize the battery life, i. e., to run for long time on a single coin-cell battery. In typical application scenarios of home automation and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), the sensors that monitor relatively unpredictable and rare events should coexist with other sensors that continuously communicate health or environmental parameter measurements. The former usually work in connectionless mode, acting as advertisers, while the latter need a persistent connection, acting as slave nodes. The coexistence of connectionless and connection-oriented networks, that share the same central node, can be required to reduce the number of handling devices, thus keeping the network complexity low and limiting the packet's traffic congestion. In this paper, the medium access management, operated by the central node, has been modeled, focusing on the scheduling procedure in both connectionless and connection-oriented communication. The models have been merged to provide a tool supporting the configuration design of BLE devices, during the network design phase that precedes the real implementation. The results highlight the suitability of the proposed tool: the ability to set the device parameters to allow us to keep a practical discovery latency for event-driven sensors and avoid undesired overlaps between scheduled scanning and connection phases due to bad management performed by the central node.

Such apps typically use peer-to-peer Bluetooth data transfer to record a contact. However, they suffer from low adoption rates, high false alarm contact indications, battery drain, and user privacy concerns. This paper proposes BECT or BEacon-based Contact Tracing, a contact tracing framework using static Bluetooth beacon devices installed in public or private places that periodically broadcast packets to nearby users that are stored as coins. Users that are positively diagnosed submit their coin IDs to a third-party service (e.g., local health authority) which can mark these coins as infected and disseminate them to other users. A match between a user's stored coins and an infected coin implies that the user has come in direct or indirect contact with an infected person. The BECT framework does not expose users' private data and conserves the device battery. We use MATLAB simulations to compare the performance of the BECT framework to phone-phone apps in a restaurant scenario and show that BECT has superior contact tracing performance. We also provide general deployment guidelines.

In other words, it is the most common and essential requirement of all drivers in a car park to fast search a preferred parking spot. Recently most parking lots provide a sensing-based display system to notify available parking spots. However, such systems are still unable to tell drivers exact parking spots and make any recommendation to improve the traffic conditions and driver experiences. In this paper, a novel machine-learning-aided smart parking system based on Internet of Things, smart mobile devices and edge computing is proposed. This novel parking system aims at providing customized parking experience to users through highly accurate positioning and user activity sensing computed as the edge intelligence. The proposed system mainly focuses on increasing user experience for parking through the concatenated autoencoder design for improving performances of the user positioning mechanism.

This requires the control of the switch between the antenna and the control circuitry to achieve both low insertion loss and high isolation. This paper presents a low insertion loss and high isolation switch based on Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) switch for 2.4 GHz Bluetooth low power (BLE) transceiver. The body-floating technique is used to improve the insertion loss's performance. An ultra-small on-chip matching network with high Q-factor is proposed. The shunt transistors are used as active shunt capacitors that create the active matching network to improve isolation characteristics. The proposed SDPT switch was designed using 55 nm CMOS process with the total area of 110 m x 210 m. The insertion loss and isolation characteristics of the proposed SPDT switch observed at 2.4 GHz are 1.85 dB and 40 dB, respectively.

However, this process can become disrupted, temporary or permanently, leading to a condition called xerostomia. Previous research regarding xerostomia successfully utilized electro-stimulation of the nerves in the oral cavity to treat the symptoms and manage the discomfort created by the condition. This paper describes a revolutionary way of treating xerostomia, by using a permanent micro-electronic implant which can measure and stimulate the salivary secretion in the oral cavity.

People are panic buying and crowding without social distancing and practice hygiene after exchanging physical touch with objects or cashiers at retail stores. A Smart Shopping System that utilizes RFID and integrated with mobile website technology can improve efficiency and effectiveness for customers to shop even during a pandemic in a more controlled manner. It can be achieved by integrating closely both hardware and software over an active internet connection to send and receive data for real-time updates for each respective customer. The research aims to facilitate users for an improved shopping experience that highlights the accessibility of easy, contactless purchasing, engaging marketing and simultaneously reduces direct contact with public possessions during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. An extensive discussion of the existing similar systems reviews, literature review and the current developments are performed in depth. The research gathered public insights through a quantitative research approach and applied the gather data for meaningful information in order to recommend an efficient solution. With the creation and visualization of a prototyping model, the researcher demonstrated how a Smart Shopping System could achieve efficiency and effectiveness in a retail store on a small scale.

Networks that self-maintain and self-heal are inherently more reliable. We study efficient and effective network self-healing and update methods for routing recovery following routing failures in a wireless multi-hop network. Network update processes are important since they enable local nodes to maintain the latest and updated neighbor information for routing given the network changes caused by failures. Network update also introduces control signals overhead. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between routing performance and overhead cost with different network update algorithms and we characterize the performance of the proposed algorithms using network simulations. We show that network updates have positive impacts on routing. In particular, the on-demand route update method provides better results among compared techniques. The improvement is varying depending on the network topology and failure condition scenario.

When it comes to thermal comfort, the best conditions for ensuring worker activity, productivity, and well-being include not only the proper design of spaces and cooling/heating systems, but also constant, real-time monitoring of the worker's physical condition. This work aims to present a complete system comprising various components capable not only of ensuring the worker's thermal comfort through the use of innovative textiles for optimal heat exchange between the individual and the environment, but also of continuously monitoring certain physiological parameters useful in determining whether the worker is subject to thermal stress. The system developed also allows the worker to be warned in the event of thermal stress and provides control and analysis tools to safety operators. This work, in particular, provides ample space for the description and validation of the textile component, in addition to presenting the system architecture and describing the main components. Finally, the wireless sensors designed to monitor physiological parameters are described and validated, and a brief functional validation of some of the architecture's software components is presented.

In indoor positioning method, fingerprinting is better than trilateration in that it is possible to avoid problems that are not effectively applied to indoor wireless attenuation model. Fingerprinting compares the radio propagation condition that is measured at the time of positioning with the set of radio propagation conditions that are measured in initial training, and estimates the position according to its similarity. However, since radio waves are superimposed by the reflection of the walls and floors in the indoor environment, positioning accuracy decreases when the layout of the environment is changed after creation of the initial training data. To solve this problem, we propose a method to infer whether some obstacle exists between each pair of transmitter and receiver by principal component analysis of RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) of multi-frequency, to detect LOS (Line-of-Sight)-shielded transmitters and to eliminate them from calculation for positioning. Comparing with existing method on typical fingerprinting, our method improved up to 31% on robustness.

The Estimation of the Potential for Using Smart-Trackers as a Part of a Medical Indoor-Positioning System	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						telemedicine; indoor-positioning system; remote health monitoring; Bluetooth Low Energy; smart-bracelet	TRACKING	This research aims to estimate the feasibility of using smart-bracelets as a part of a medicine indoor-positioning system, to monitor the health status and location of patients in a hospital. The smart-bracelet takes on the role of a token of the system and can measure pulse, blood pressure and saturation and provide data transmission over the BLE. The distance between token and anchor was calculated by the RSSI. The position of a token and anchor relative to each other was determined by the trilateration method. The results of the research showed that the accuracy of the developed system in a static position is 1.46 m and exceeds 3 m in a dynamic position. Results of experiments showed that measurements from the smart bracelets are transmitted to the server of the system without distortion. The study results indicated that smart-bracelets could be used to locate patients inside a hospital or estimate their current health state. Given the low accuracy of systolic pressure measurement, it is recommended to develop an algorithm that will allow smooth measuring error for higher-precision estimation of the patient's general health state. In addition, it is planned to improve the positioning algorithm.

An Empirical Performance Study of Intra-vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks under WiFi and Bluetooth Interference	2013 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 09-13, 2013	Atlanta, GA	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc		Intra-vehicular; intra-car; wireless sensor network; IVWSN; ZigBee; Bluetooth; WiFi; interference	ZIGBEE	Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Network (IVWSN) is a new automotive architecture that applies wireless technologies to the communications between Electrical Control Units (ECUs) and sensors. It can potentially help achieve better fuel economy, reduce wiring complexity, and support additional new applications. In the existing works, most of the popular wireless technologies applied on IVWSNs occupy the same 2.4 GHz ISM frequency bands as WiFi and Bluetooth do. It is therefore essential to evaluate the performance of IVWSNs under interference from WiFi and Bluetooth devices, especially when these devices are inside the vehicle. In this paper, we report the results of a comprehensive experimental study of IVWSNs based on ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy under WiFi and Bluetooth interference. The impact of the interference from Bluetooth and WiFi devices can be clearly observed from the experiments. The results of the experiments conducted suggest that Bluetooth Low Energy technology outperforms ZigBee technology in the context of IVWSNs when WiFi interference exists in the car.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on energy conserving issues and solutions in using diverse wireless radio access technologies for IoT connectivity, e.g., the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) machine type communications, IEEE 802.11ah, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Z-Wave. We look into the literature in broad areas of standardization, academic research, and industry development, and structurally summarize the energy conserving solutions based on several technical criteria. We also propose future research directions regarding energy conserving issues in wireless networking-based IoT.

In this paper, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system has been designed in order to create better living conditions for older people. In this way, people can live independently longer in their own house with an improved quality of life. The proposed system includes several features. On the one hand, it is able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sources (i.e., environmental sensors and medical devices). On the other hand, it is able to guarantee outdoor and indoor localization aimed to know the real-time position of the elderly both inside and outside their home. A remote reasoning system processes all collected data with the aim of generating appropriate events and alerts. The architecture was validated from a functional point of view through a proof-of-concept.

Various appliances like thermostats, smoke detectors, intelligent lighting systems, etc., have appeared on the market to create a smart home. Vendors have the availability over multiple wireless technologies to connect their products to the smart home and communicate with the user. The most adopted technologies are the ones that can interface directly with a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet, without the need for an additional gateway. Within this context, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are the dominant technologies. In this paper we look at home automation devices that have chosen to solely support Bluetooth 4.0 as communication interface. We highlight the downsides of this technology in a home setting and try to mitigate this problem by exploiting the Wi-Fi capabilities of other devices, in particular smartphones. The proposed solution realizes a Wi-Fi bridge on the smartphone that is connected to the Bluetooth device. This enables other smartphone users to connect to the Bluetooth device over the Wi-Fi network, alleviating some of the downsides of the Bluetooth technology.

The proposed scheme adopts four classification parameters to classify and prioritize data from a sensor. With the packet prioritization scheme, the sensed data having the lowest priority is only delivered using the proposed keep-alive message notification to decrease the number of packets transmitted. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme shows the improvement of resource utilization in energy consumption, and bandwidth usage compared with the existing CoAP methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme supports quality-of-service (QoS) per packet by differentiating transmission delays regarding priorities.

Among other technologies, readily available BLE can be exploited to achieve an energy-efficient and low-cost solution. This work presents the design, implementation and comparison of a RSSI-based and a MCPD-based indoor localization system. The implementation is based on a lightweight wkNN algorithm that processes RSSI and MCPD distance data from connection-less BLE Beacons. The designed hardware and firmware are implemented around the state-of-the-art SoC for BLE, the nRF5340 from Nordic Semiconductor. Experimental evaluation with real-time data processing has been evaluated and presented in a 7.3 m x 8.9 m room with furniture and six beacon nodes. The experimental results on randomly chosen validation points within the room show an average error of only 0.50 m for the MCPD approach, whereas the RSSI approach achieved an error of 1.39 m.

Although modern parking lots have installed the sensing and display systems to inform drivers on the availability of parking areas, such systems are unable to tell drivers exact parking spots and make any recommendation to improve the traffic conditions and driver experiences. In this paper, a novel analytic-based smart parking system clustering Internet of Things, smart mobile devices and edge computing is proposed. This novel parking system aims at providing customized parking experience to users through highly accurate positioning and user status detection which are achieved by joint mobile sensing-machine learning based analytics as the edge intelligence. Based on the proof-of-concept implementation, the proposed scheme can achieve 99.1% positioning accuracy of a parking spot; in terms of user status sensing, especially getting in a car and out of a car, detection accuracy shows 96%; finally, it shows much shorter service consumption time of 15.6 times than the legacy approach.

J	Park, S				Park, Soochang			D-PARK: User-Centric Smart Parking System over BLE-Beacon Based Internet of Things	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						smart parking; Internet of Things; Bluetooth Low Energy; status sensing; proximity detection; anlaytics		Our daily life services are quickly becoming smarter with intelligence and information through artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data technologies. Parking services are one of the most frequently used in our daily life-cycle. This parking application could be classified into several features according to demands and properties, such as parking capacity balancing on a city-level view, parking fee maximization for achieving the service provider demand, empty parking spot notification within a parking lot, etc. This paper concentrates on parking space detection and alert to users. Most smart services rely on smart mobile derives of users such as smartphones and smartwatches. The proposed novel mechanism for smart parking is based on a smart device to gather mobile sensing data such as users' activity and position data. Acquired mobile data are analyzed via machine learning technologies to provide dedicated parking services per user. Based on real testbed setups on campus and the proof-of-concept implementation, the proposed localization can achieve accuracy of a parking spot scale (2m-second guess 95%); moreover, it shows a much lower service operation period of 6.8 times (34s) than the legacy approach (230s).

The aims of this study were to investigate the characteristics of EDA, to design a portable electronic device capable of acquiring it and to formulate a hypothesis regarding the relationship between EDA and diabetic foot. Materials and methods: This study investigated the relationship between EDA signal and diabetic neuropathy using a self-designed device, and tested it with a procedure defined for diabetic foot screening. After that, mean skin conductance level (M-SCL), mean skin conductance response (M-SCR) to stimuli, and difference in mean SCL between feet (DBF) were obtained. Participants were assessed based on whether they had diabetes or not and on their clinical history and care habits. Afterwards, 3 groups were selected, namely reference, people with diabetes out of risk, and people with diabetes at risk of diabetic foot. Results: 22 patients were included in the final test. Several types of stimuli were applied through a test, and responses were recorded and analyzed. Diabetic patients reflected lower MSCL and M-SCR values. Statistical difference was found for those being at risk regarding M-SCR (P<0.01). Conclusion: A test protocol was defined, based on prior tests and measures, to acquire proper and reliable data. Lower SCL and SCR were found according to the diabetes progress. In particular, significant difference was found for M-SCR. No significant difference in DBF values for those at risk was found. These results have the potential to be used as part of a diagnostic tool, which may include other parameters and questionnaires, for diabetic foot screening.

The concept of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) can help people in everyday tasks in life. This study proposes a smart trash bin to help solve the problem of waste management and monitoring. Traditional methods of garbage disposal require human labor, and pose a hazard to the worker. The proposed smart garbage bin can move itself by using ultrasonic sensors and a web camera, which serves as its "eyes." Because the smart garbage bin is designed for indoor use and mobility, we use a Bluetooth beacon for location tracking, whereby the bin transmits a constant signal that the other devices in the environment can detect. A smart garbage bin was developed in this study to be used in the E315 research room in the Electrical Engineering Department of the National Chin-Yi University of Technology. An Android application was also developed to help users monitor waste in the smart bin.

There are great expectations in using IoT in healthcare, but most studies describe very futuristic and disruptive solutions for the healthcare real world. In a near future these solutions could be implemented, but now we need some "baby steps" to reach an e-Health with IoT technology. In this paper it is presented a solution to transform a doctor's office in an IoT office by helping the doctor attend a patien. This solution has impact in the doctor's work because (s)he has a limited time to attend a patient and a big part of this time is spent writing the results of the appointment in a computer record - the electronic patient record. By other hand the patient improve their experience because the doctor will give them more attention and care.

Its value is currently monitored by performing few measurements per day, acquired through heel pricks or arterial samplings. Unfortunately, the frequency of those samplings is quite low in preterm newborns, who are very low birth weight infants, due to their fragility. As a result, hyper-or hypo-glycemia events occurring between two separate measurements remain often unnoticed. A medical research group working at the University Hospital of Padova already proved the clinical benefits of continuous glucose monitoring for preterm newborns hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. However, glucose data are still sampled through individual devices that are not integrated into a central monitoring system. Thus the health care staff has to visit regularly the cradles, watch the glycemia trends and pay attention to alarms. Our contribution deals with the implementation of a system based on mobile technologies that sends the data acquired through commercial glucometers to a central database, so that they become available in real time for the staff in the ward room. Moreover, we also integrated into that system an algorithm described in the literature for recommending the most appropriate glucose infusion rates based on the last readings of the patient.

Certain audits and papers show that Quick Response (QR) codes have low rates of usage which might affect the effectiveness of contact tracing efforts, especially in Fiji. This paper is a limited review of the technologies as well as contact protocols used in contact tracing, the official contact tracing apps used in the south pacific and an overview of the careFiji app. The aim of this is to find out about the contact tracing technologies and protocols to aid in designing a solution to the problems encountered in careFiji as well as other similar contact tracing apps in the South Pacific. The authors propose a NearField Communication (NFC) Contact Tracing Solution Model to supplement the current QR scanning feature of the careFiji app to allow for increased usage of the location-coupled tracking feature of contact tracing efforts. Results of tests conducted prove the convenience and time saving measures of a sample contact tracing app employing NFC versus the careFiji app relying on QR scanning for location-coupled tracking.

The low power consumption of Bluetooth low energy (LE) devices compared to the conventional Bluetooth devices has enhanced its importance in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Therefore, Bluetooth low energy device based solution needs expansion in the IoT network infrastructure. The transceivers in the literature and modulation schemes are compared and summarized. Energy consumption of modulation schemes in Bluetooth communication are analyzed and compared using the model presented in this work. In this approach considering both circuit and signal power consumption, optimum modulation order for minimum energy consumption has been found using numerical calculation and relation between signal to noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. Battery life for IoT sensors using Bluetooth LE technology as a wireless link has been analyzed considering multiple transaction times for transmitters having different power consumption. MFSK and more bandwidth-efficient GFSK are identified as low energy solution for all smart devices.

J	Lorenc, A; Szarata, J; Czuba, M				Lorenc, Augustyn; Szarata, Jakub; Czuba, Michal			Real-Time Location System (RTLS) Based on the Bluetooth Technology for Internal Logistics	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						real-time location system; Bluetooth; Bluetooth Low Energy; sensor; internal logistics; disruption; location		The problem of object localization in indoor environments is very important in order to make a company effective and to detect disruption in the logistics system in real-time. Present research investigates how the IoT (Internet of Things) location system based on Bluetooth can be implemented for this solution. The location based on the Bluetooth is hard to predict. Radio wave interference in this frequency is affected by other devices, steel, vessels containing water, and more. However, proper data processing and signal stabilization can increase the accuracy of the location. To be sure that the location system based on the BT (Bluetooth) can be implemented for real cases, an analysis of signal strength amplitude and disruption was made. The paper presents R&D (Research and Development) works with a practical test in real cases. The signal strength fluctuation for the receiver is between 7 and 10 dBm for ESP32 device and between 13 and 14 dBm for Raspberry. For commercial implementation the number of devices scanned in the time window is also important. For Raspberry, the optimal time window is 5 s; in this time six transmitters can be detected. ESP32 has a problem with detecting devices in a short time, as just two transmitters can be detected in 4-8 s time window. Localisation precision depends on the distance between transmitter and receiver, and the angle from the axis of the directional antenna. For the distance of 10 m the measurement error is 1.2-6.1 m, whilst for the distance of 40 m the measurement error is 4.9 to 24.6 m. Using a Kalman filter can reduce the localization error to 1.5 m.

The suitability of commodity wireless chipsets for traffic sensing purposes was already described in the literature: The signal propagation paths inside a wireless sensor network nearby a street are affected by the presence of a passing car. This leads to detectable field strength variations and enables traffic monitoring applications. However, all existing low-cost approaches suffer from missing spatial information, which leads to counting inaccuracies for high-density traffic scenarios. It was recently shown that the frequency dependence of the Received Signal Strength contains coarse information about the surrounding. We show that this information is suitable for traffic monitoring purposes and propose a low-cost traffic counting approach that allows to observe the traffic on a two-lane road individually for each lane. It is further shown that the counting accuracy can be significantly improved compared to existing low-cost approaches that cannot distinguish between individual lanes. Using a Bluetooth implementation, a detection rate of 99.6 % with a false-positive rate of 1.1 % was achieved.

An IPS has direction relies nearby anchors and also can be entirely local to your smartphone. With the rapid growth and sharp increase in Indoor Positioning System (IPS) demand in the world, there are a lot of researchers trying to invent new algorithm to develop IPS. This paper proposed the Bluetooth-Base Indoor Positioning Algorithm. The RF characteristics such as RSSI and WLAN RSSI fingerprinting system normally formed by two phases, fist is offline phase and second is online phase. Fingerprinting system handling both off-line and online data and estimate the user's location. Our algorithm design is a collection of Weighted KNearest Neighbors (WKNN) and Filtering algorithms by KALMAN Filter. Finally, to avoid the problems of IPS and get a better accurate we proposed two algorithms: Weighted KNearest Neighbors Particle Filter (WKNNPF) and Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors Extended Kalman Filter (WKNNEKF) compare to KNN and WKNN result. After comparing we found that the result of WKNNPF and WKNNEKF is better result than KNN and WKNN. The Probability in 3M of WKNN is about 79%, WKNNEKF is about 89%, and WKNNPF is about 95.1%. Among one of the proposed algorithms WKNNPF is better than WKNNEKF on accuracy 1.7-2 meters with 42.2m/s response time.

In this article, we present our proposal - PrecaElevator, a novel elevator system in smart building that enables passengers to reduce their waiting time through pre-registering elevator calls. After upgraded a traditional elevator to Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled and transferred the real-time computational capability to the agent server, the elevator was upgraded as a smart object computing on context awareness in both elevator and passengers. By leveraging BLE-based localization of the passenger, PrecaElevator enables the passenger to pre-register elevator call if his/her location was detected within the callable range for elevator control. We have experimented the proposed system in the real smart building environment. The simulations based on the calculated waiting time from elevator historical records showed the effectiveness of waiting time reduction.

Multi-purpose and multi-source energy management system for biomedical implants	26TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON SOLID-STATE TRANSDUCERS, EUROSENSOR 2012	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	26th European Conference on Solid-State Transducers (Eurosensors)	SEP 09-12, 2012	Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Microsystem Elect & Photon, Krakow, POLAND		Wroclaw Univ Technol, Fac Microsystem Elect & Photon	Energy harvesting; power management; wireless communications		This paper describes a multi-purpose energy management system that can harvest energy from a multitude of power sources. In order to suffice power needs of a smart hip prosthesis, a prototype was built considering the use of two types of power sources: energy harvesting micro-power generators for intermittent implant electronics powering; wireless energy, by means of an activation system, responsible for, when needed, continuously powering the implant electronics and also configuring its mode of operation. Intermittently or continuously, it is now possible to energize more power demanding systems as the ones that uses a RF transceiver. The smart hip prosthesis can now become a wireless body sensor network node using LR-WPAN protocols such as Bluetooth low energy as is intended in this work. Preliminary results proved that is possible to energize a Bluetooth low energy module, for over 100 s, solely using the stored energy produced by one of the micro-power generators.

BM introduces a novel network concept that supports up to 32767 devices and 127 hops. So far no readily available dataset or toolset exists to perform systematic in-depth performance analysis of this standard. In this paper, we present insights on the performance and practical usability of BM. We conduct realistic smart office experiments with heterogeneous devices distributed throughout an area of approximately 1100m(2). By varying network parameters and BM node features, we collect the first public available BM dataset. Based on our experience, the use of current implementations is error-prone due to the complexity of BM. To facilitate researchers to conduct further experiments, we propose a toolset to configure and systematically evaluate BM performance. Finally we discuss several pitfalls that should be avoided in designing and deploying such networks.

These microchips help stay informed concerning other objects, as well as a significant number of these devices sense their surroundings and report it to different machines and also to the people, so is the application of home environment. The viable significance of the IoT is made conceivable through enabling technologies, for example, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), essentially utilized for detecting operations. In any case, there is a principle prerequisite that makes a wireless sensing perfect for use in the IoT, which is the energy efficiency. Much of the time, the sensing devices are battery-powered, so low-power system is prime requirement. Several mechanisms can be adopted in order to reduce the power consumption while designing the devices that implement a wireless protocol. This paper has presented a comparative study of various energy efficient IoT techniques.

An on-skin platform for wireless monitoring of flow rate, cumulative loss and temperature of sweat in real time	NATURE ELECTRONICS			English	Article								Monitoring the flow rate, cumulative loss and temperature of sweat can provide valuable physiological insights for the diagnosis of thermoregulatory disorders and illnesses related to heat stress. However, obtaining accurate, continuous estimates of these parameters with high temporal resolution remains challenging. Here, we report a platform that can wirelessly measure sweat rate, sweat loss and skin temperature in real time. The approach combines a short, straight fluid passage to capture sweat as it emerges from the skin with a flow sensor that is based on a thermal actuator and precision thermistors, and that is physically isolated from, but thermally coupled to, the sweat. The platform transfers data autonomously using a Bluetooth Low Energy system on a chip. Our approach can also be integrated with advanced microfluidic systems and colorimetric chemical reagents for the measurement of pH and the concentration of chloride, creatinine and glucose in sweat. A wearable platform, which uses a thermal sensing module isolated from biofluids and a Bluetooth Low Energy system on a chip for wireless data transfer, can be used to continuously monitor sweat.

In order to combat with this issue, the World Health Organization has developed the five moments of hand hygiene. However, studies show that approximately only 50% of all necessary hand disinfections are done in hospitals and care facilities. These facts point out the need for the development of solutions which will improve the compliance to the hand hygiene regulations. In this paper a system for indirect hand disinfection assistance using ultra-low power Bluetooth Low Energy beacons is presented. A personal wearable hygiene assistant gives the user tailor-made feedback on compliance to the hand hygiene regulations. More precisely, the hand hygiene moments are mapped when entering or leaving defined areas. These areas are bounded by ultra-low power Bluetooth Low Energy beacons which are capable of bounding small areas due to their significantly low transmission power. The developed solution is capable of successfully detecting and assisting with three out of the five moments of hand hygiene.

Operating in a body area network around a smartphone user they serve a variety of commercial, medical, and personal uses. Whether used for fitness tracking, mobile health monitoring, or as remote controllers, wearable devices can include sensors that collect a variety of data and actuators that provide haptic feedback and unique user interfaces for controlling software and hardware. Wearables are typically wireless and use Bluetooth LE (low energy) to transmit data to a waiting smartphone app. Frequently, apps forward this data onward to online web servers for tracking. Security and privacy concerns abound when wearables capture sensitive data or provide critical functionality. This paper develops a platform, called SecuWear, for conducting wearable security research, collecting data, and identifying vulnerabilities in hardware and software. SecuWear combines open source technologies to enable researchers to rapidly prototype security vulnerability test cases, evaluate them on actual hardware, and analyze the results to understand how best to mitigate problems. The paper includes two types of evaluation in the form of a comparative analysis and empirical study. The results reveal how several passive observation attacks present themselves in wearable applications and how the SecuWear platform can capture the necessary information needed to identify and combat such attacks.

The characteristics required by applications, such as coverage area, scalability, transmission data rate, and applicability, refer to the Physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer designs of protocols. This paper presents a deep study of medium access control (MAC) layer protocols that are used in IoT with a detailed description of such protocols grouped (by short and long distance coverage). For short range coverage protocols, the following are considered: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1, Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4, Wireless Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol (Wireless-HART), Z-Wave, Weightless, and IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ah. For the long range group, Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT), Long Term Evolution (LTE) CAT-0, LTE CAT-M, LTE CAT-N, Long Range Protocol (LoRa), and SigFox protocols are studied. A comparative study is performed for each group of protocols in order to provide insights and a reference study for IoT applications, considering their characteristics, limitations, and behavior. Open research issues on the topic are also identified.	[Oliveira, Luiz; Rodrigues, Joel J. P. C.] Natl Inst Telecommun Inatel, BR-37540000 Santa Rita Do Sapucai, MG, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Joel J. P.

The ability to constantly monitor the patient's vital signs for abnormalities, in addition to alerting first responders to immediate problems, would allow for more rapid medical treatment. As the population of the United States ages, low-cost and ubiquitous medical devices will improve the ability of medical personnel to diagnose potential health issues early, thus increasing the survival rate and decreasing the potential complications. Electrocardiograms are a major focus of the medical community due to the prevalence of heart issues among elderly Americans, and as the cost of sensors and wireless communication decreases, new devices are possible. This paper describes a Bluetooth-based, dry electrode electrocardiogram monitoring system seamlessly integrated into a T-shirt. The shirt used three dry silver-based electrodes to collect the ECG signal and streamed the resulting signal to an Android smartphone for analysis.

We propose a system that optimizes both the number of beacons and their placement in a given environment. We propose a novel cost-function, called CovBSM, that allows to simultaneously optimize the 3-coverage while maximizing the beacon spreading. Using this cost function, we propose a framework that maximize both the number of beacons and their placement in a given environment. The proposed solution accounts for the indoor infrastructure and its influence on the RF signal propagation by embedding a realistic simulator into the optimization process.

Many of them are compatible with several transmission protocols to collect data from IoT end-nodes (e.g. sensors/actuators). This paper introduces a new approach for the management of multi-protocol IoT architecture with redundancy features. Assuming the functional view diagram of IoT Architecture reference project (IoT-A), adaptations in communication and management functional blocks have been introduced to support redundancy based on multi-protocol and all the related management issues. The main goal is to keep this feature transparent for the rest of the system, which includes the application and its users. An experimental setup was designed and experiments were carried out to demonstrate feasibility and to characterize performance of the proposed solution. The results show that, with the multi-protocol redundancy activated, the IoT framework is capable of transparently delivering more information to the user application.	[Silva, Diego R.

It has recently been shown, though, that foot-worn sensors alone cannot reflect variations in the exerted energy that stems from changes in the running economy. In order to support long-term improvement in running, these changes need to be taken into account. We propose leveraging the presence of two additional sensors worn by the most ambitious recreational runners for improved measurement: a watch and a heart rate chest strap. Using these accelerometers, which are already present and distributed over the athlete's body, carries more information about metabolic demand than a single foot-worn sensor. In this work, we demonstrate the mutual information between acceleration data and the metabolic demand of running by leveraging the information bottleneck of a constrained convolutional neural network. We perform lab measurements on 29 ambitious recreational runners (age = 28 +/- 7 years, weekly running distance = 50 +/- 25 km, VO2max = 60.3 +/- 7.4 mL . min(.)(-1)kg(-1)). We show that information about the metabolic demand of running is contained in kinetic data. Additionally, we prove that the combination of three sensors (foot, torso, and lower arm) carries significantly more information than a single foot-worn sensor. We advocate for the development of running power systems that incorporate the sensors in watches and chest straps to improve the validity of running power and, thereby, long-term training planning.

In this paper, we focus on how to specify and verify where and how the data are received. The challenging issue here is how to utilize trustworthy 3rd party verification mechanisms to check whether a requester is in the designated area specified by the creator and whether the delivery follows a desired path. We call this new service Right Place, Right Path Data Delivery (R2D2). The current network and geolocation techniques are investigated for their capabilities in verifying and ensuring such R2D2 services. We created software tools to specify and verify such R2D2 services. We show that the verification of R2D2 services is quite challenging.	[Ashary, Ehab; Chow, C.

However, the vast majority of works deals only in monitoring the activities of a single inhabitant. Nevertheless, most of the people in the current context of ageing population does not live alone. Recognizing the activities performed by each inhabitant in a house is an important challenge. A first step to achieve this is to be able to distinguish where each inhabitant is in the house. In this paper, we present a new device to track and identify people in a multi-residents context. Experiments have been conducted to validate the reliability and accuracy of the proposed device.

The efficacy of these devices relies on the UV-C dose they deliver to surfaces. This dose is dependent on the room layout, the shadowing, the position of the UV-C source, lamp degradation, humidity and other factors, making it challenging to estimate. Furthermore, since UV-C exposure is regulated, personnel in the room must not be exposed to UV-C doses beyond occupational limits. We proposed a systematic method to monitor the UV-C dose administered to surfaces during a robotic disinfection procedure. This was achieved using a distributed network of wireless UV-C sensors that provide real-time measurements to a robotic platform and operator. These sensors were validated for their linearity and cosine response. To ensure operators could safely remain in the area, a wearable sensor was incorporated to monitor the UV-C exposure of an operator, and it provided an audible warning upon exposure and, if necessary, ceased the UV-C emission from the robot. Enhanced disinfection procedures could then be conducted as items in the room could be rearranged during the procedure to maximise the UV-C fluence delivered to otherwise inaccessible surfaces while allowing UVC disinfection to occur in parallel with traditional cleaning. The system was tested for the terminal disinfection of a hospital ward. During the procedure, the robot was manually positioned in the room by the operator repeatedly, who then used feedback from the sensors to ensure the desired UV-C dose was achieved while also conducting other cleaning tasks. An analysis verified the practicality of this disinfection methodology while highlighting factors which could affect its adoption.

Our device enables researchers to wirelessly configure stimulator settings, such as amplitude, pulse width, channel selection, and frequency, via a phone app. The system uses impedance-independent current-mode stimulation and steers current to a selected channel. In addition to monophasic and biphasic stimulation, the system also supports arbitrary waveform stimulation using pre-stored lookup tables. The system uses a configurable grounding phase to clear residual charge and a stimulation compliance monitor to ensure safe operation. The compliance monitor wirelessly reports the current during stimulation, the amount of passive recharge current, and the DC voltage of the electrode interface. The 400mAh battery is easy to replace and can go over 40 hours between charges. The system can be built for less than $50 using easy-to-source components to support inexpensive, highly-parallel research applications.

That's why indoor localization has been attracting researcher attention. A popular method for indoor localization is Fingerprinting. However, it is not easy to reach high accuracy in positioning with only Fingerprinting. Several current techniques could be used to improve the accuracy of Fingerprinting such as Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL). In this paper, we propose an BLE iBeacon-based indoor localization system using Fingerprinting method. The system applies k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) - an ML algorithm to decide the user position. In order to reduce the computational cost and ensure the accuracy of the system, we propose to use lightweight feature vectors that include information of the nearest beacons and device azimuth for training Machine Learning algorithm. We performed some experiments to verify the proposed system. The results show that the method provides a feasible indoor positioning solution with high accuracy.

Accuracy in indoor positioning is always a big challenge that requires the endeavor of researchers. Without any extra cost, Trilateration is considered a feasible method to be able to build an indoor positioning system.

In this paper, we present an indoor navigation system based on a combination of wall-mounted wireless sensors, a mobile health application (mHealth app), and WiFi/Bluetooth beacons. Such a system can be used to track and trace people with neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, throughout the hospital complex. The Contact tracing is accomplished by using Bluetooth low-energy beacons to detect and monitor the possibilities of those who have been exposed to communicable diseases such as COVID-19. The communication flow between the mHealth app and the cloud-based framework is explained elaborately in the paper. The system provides a real-time remote monitoring system for primary medical care in cases where relatives of Alzheimer's patients and doctors are having complications that may demand medical care or hospitalization. The proposed indoor navigation system has been found to be useful in assisting patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) while in the hospital building.

However, the formation of a mesh network, overlaying on the existing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons infrastructure, can severely degrade the lifetime of underlying beacons owing to the excessive current drawn by the scanning event. Even though we can sustain the lifetime of the underlying beacon with duty-cycle scanning, such duty-cycle scanning imposes another challenge to the overlay mesh in disseminating the packet. To this end, this paper proposes a novel overlay protocol that: 1) employs duty-cycle scanning to guarantee the lifetime of the underlying beacon, while 2) defining a set of scanning policies to increase the packet dissemination rate through the overlay mesh network. The duty-cycle scanning defines the scanning time slot based on the lowest feasible duty cycle unveiled through a comprehensive analysis of energy consumed by advertising and scanning events. The scanning policies, on the other hand, allow each node to explore all possible time slots before locking their scanning event to a particular time slot that is most likely to hear the incoming packet. Extensive experiments with practical implementation demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed overlay mesh for real-world use cases.

J	Tang, Q				Tang, Qiang			Another Look at Privacy-Preserving Automated Contact Tracing	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SPATIAL ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						COVID-19; contact tracing; security; privacy		In the current COVID-19 pandemic, manual contact tracing has been proven to be very helpful to reach close contacts of infected users and slow down spread of the virus. To improve its scalability, a number of automated contact tracing (ACT) solutions have been proposed, and some of them have been deployed. Despite the dedicated efforts, security and privacy issues of these solutions are still open and under intensive debate. In this article, we examine the ACT concept from a broader perspective, by focusing on not only security and privacy issues but also functional issues such as interface, usability, and coverage. We first elaborate on these issues and particularly point out the inevitable privacy leakages in existing Bluetooth Low Energy based ACT solutions, including centralized and decentralized ones. In addition, we examine the existing venue-based ACT solutions and identify their privacy and security concerns. Then, we propose a generic venue-based ACT solution and a concrete instantiation based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Our solution monitors users' contacting history only in virus-spreading-prone venues and offers higher-level protection for both security and privacy than its predecessors. Finally, we evaluate our solution from security, privacy, and efficiency perspectives, and also highlight how to reduce false positives in some specific indoor environments.

While mobile applications have been used with good success in managing ICSs, traditional methods of distributing applications (e.g., app stores) are not well suited to the task of discovering, distributing, and building human machine interfaces (HMIs) for ICS, as the highly individualized and often proprietary individual components of ICSs have vastly different interfaces leading to a need to download hundreds of applications. We propose the No Effort Rapid Development (NERD) middleware framework to address the challenges of in-field HMI discovery, provisioning, communication, and co-evolution with related ICSs. Middleware services offer the ability to simplify on-demand HMI distribution and operation of ICSs. NERD leverages existing ICS device-markers (e.g., QR-codes or RFID tags) or Bluetooth low-energy protocols for rapid cyber-physical discovery and provisioning of HMIs in the field. Device-markers and Bluetooth low-energy protocols have a very limited data capacity and transmission speed, and to achieve on-device storage of HMIs, we propose using a compact data-driven domain-specific language that emphasizes data sources and sinks between the HMI and IC.

Although some variants exist, IoT systems are basically composed of many devices and servers and therefore require the development of both device-and server-side systems. This makes the development of IoT system difficult. In this paper, an IoT architecture is proposed that avoids this requirement, thereby simplifying the IoT system development. As an example of our proposed architecture, we present a Global Positioning System (GPS) improvement system from the device side only. Each device communicates with other devices to acquire more accurate GPS data. The accuracy of our GPS improvement system was verified with prototype application.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based sensors can be considered as a solution for monitoring personal vital signs data. In this study, we propose a personalized healthcare monitoring system by utilizing a BLE-based sensor device, real-time data processing, and machine learning-based algorithms to help diabetic patients to better self-manage their chronic condition. BLEs were used to gather users' vital signs data such as blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and blood glucose (BG) from sensor nodes to smartphones, while real-time data processing was utilized to manage the large amount of continuously generated sensor data. The proposed real-time data processing utilized Apache Kafka as a streaming platform and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the patient. The results show that commercial versions of the BLE-based sensors and the proposed real-time data processing are sufficiently efficient to monitor the vital signs data of diabetic patients. Furthermore, machine learning based classification methods were tested on a diabetes dataset and showed that a Multilayer Perceptron can provide early prediction of diabetes given the user's sensor data as input. The results also reveal that Long Short-Term Memory can accurately predict the future BG level based on the current sensor data. In addition, the proposed diabetes classification and BG prediction could be combined with personalized diet and physical activity suggestions in order to improve the health quality of patients and to avoid critical conditions in the future.

Such systems include location estimation algorithms based on time series data from Wi-Fi, BLE, and other devices. Algorithms use to tracking location in real-time and obtain a trajectory close to the actual path. This, in turn, opens up opportunities for finding typical pathways, queues, and bottlenecks in various indoor places. IPS are often used in healthcare, and they are an essential part of the organization of internal processes in the case of a virtual hospital. In this research, we use iBeacons equipment because of its low cost and ease of use. However, the signals received at the objects have high noise, and the location estimation algorithms have an error that accumulates over time. This paper considered two ways to solve high noise: a probabilistic-based method and a neural network method. These algorithms have closer errors (2.11 - 0.96 m), but using the neural network method makes it possible to increase the performance of the indoor positioning algorithms. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Capacity Control in Indoor Spaces Using Machine Learning Techniques Together with BLE Technology	JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); machine learning; COVID capacity control; level occupancy; occupancy detection; indoor detection		At present, capacity control in indoor spaces is critical in the current situation in which we are living in, due to the pandemic. In this work, we propose a new solution using machine learning techniques with BLE technology. This study presents a real experiment in a university environment and we study three different prediction models using machine learning techniques-specifically, logistic regression, decision trees and artificial neural networks. As a conclusion, the study shows that machine learning techniques, in particular decision trees, together with BLE technology, provide a solution to the problem. The contribution of this research work shows that the prediction model obtained is capable of detecting when the COVID capacity of an enclosed space is exceeded. In addition, it ensures that no false negatives are produced, i.e., all the people inside the laboratory will be correctly counted.	[Beato Gutierrez, M.

These applications provide users with convenience and efficiency, however, they are vulnerable to various attacks, such as skimming, eavesdropping, and relay attacks. Modern mobile devices are equipped with sophisticated sensors and receivers to facilitate the process of proximity verification by collecting and comparing information retrieved from the environment. In this paper, we propose multiple physical security features which are accessible through smart devices, namely, RSSI (Receiving Signal Strength Indicator), round-trip time, GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates, and Wi-Fi access point lists, to precisely identify the close proximity of two devices. These security features are highly efficient to provide proof of physical proximity. We first evaluate each physical security feature individually, through real-life experiments, to demonstrate their efficacy in identifying environment characteristics. Then, we evaluate the performance of each security feature using Wilcoxon test. The results show that the proposed security features are effective in identifying physical proximity and can be combined for better accuracy.

The demodulator is based on a phase-shift quadrature discriminator. A preamble detector controls the sequencing of the blocks operation to minimize power consumption. An IF input signal of 1 MHz is used, the same of the data rate, hence, allowing a low-power receiver implementation. The implementation is fully digital with a silicon area of 0.06 mm(2) in 130 nm process. Simulations show a state-of-art current consumption of about 143 mu A from a single 1.2 V supply voltage. The proposed demodulator requires a SNR of 15 dB for a BER of 0.1 % for up to +/- 200 kHz frequency offset variation.

The data transmission control algorithm applied allows for the transmission of additional information using the standard PDU format and, at the same time, goes beyond the Bluetooth teletransmission standard (BLE). The episodic broadcast transmission makes it possible to receive information from sensors without the need to create a dedicated radio link or a defined network structure. The radio transmission controlled by the occurrence of a specific event in the monitored signal is combined with the reference wire transmission. The signals from two different types of sensors and the simulated ECG signal are used to control the BLE transmission. The presented results of laboratory tests indicate the effectiveness of episodic data transmission in the BLE standard. The conducted analysis showed that the mean difference in pulse detection using the episodic transmission compared to the wire transmission is 0.038 s, which is about 4% of the mean duration of a single cycle, assuming that the average adult human pulse is 60 BPM.

Against this background, this research investigates the impact of different beacon sensor locations in a construction site on how quickly a worker can receive the individualized hazard alarms. This research took an experimental study approach to address this objective. After a prototype of a beacon-based hazard alarm system was developed, the system was tested in a concrete structure building under construction. In the experiment, the locations where the experimenter received the first hazard alarm were recorded in repetitive trials while the beacon sensor was located in four different locations, such as (1) at the entrance of the room, (2) behind the front side wall, (3) on the internal wall facing the access point, and (4) on the internal wall not facing the access point and in a partially enclosed room in the concrete structure. The rate of successful alarm notification (i.e., the rate that the person received the hazard alarm before arriving at the target location) was 89%, 68%, 48%, and 19%, respectively, for the four locations of the beacon sensor. Meanwhile, the heat maps indicating where the hazard alarm notification was received show that the "behind the front side wall" setting yielded the most desired pattern of notification reception, wherein the person received the hazard alarm just before arriving at the room. These results show that the hazard alarm function of the system could be severely affected by the beacon sensor's location and implies that the locations of beacon sensors should be decided carefully based on the type of hazard involved and the workers targeted for receiving the alarms.

Electromagnetic interference collected by antennas can propagate in the receiver front-end causing communication errors. Therefore, the parasitic coupling between PCB printed antenna and an interference source is discussed through simulations and a lumped-element equivalent circuit is proposed. The main causes of errors induced by low-frequency electromagnetic interference are analyzed referring to two different front-end integrated circuits. The low noise amplifier is considered responsible for communication errors. The susceptibility of the receiver to EMI is evaluated by injecting low-frequency interfering waveforms in the receiver front-end once the wireless communication is established. The susceptibility criteria used are the packet error rate and the number of packets lost. Vulnerability to low-frequency interference was found. Some practical design guidelines are discussed for systems incorporating both RF transceiver and power switching circuits.

In the most dangerous cases, the use of special devices for GPS tracing is recommended. However, the truth is that they are used only in extreme cases. This work describes the idea and operation of a mobile application to combat domestic violence. Among the main technologies that are used in the implementation of the proposal are Android, BLE and LTE. If an offender gets close to a victim, even if the established threshold distance has not been broken, the victim is warned thanks to the application. Besides, if the threshold distance is broken, automatic streaming of a real-time video is sent to the police and a list of stored contacts are warned so that they can try to help to protect the victim till the police arrives.

The principal goal of this study is to implement strategies for low power consumption rates during the device's smooth and uninterrupted operation as well as during data transmission. Our approach is organised in three basic levels. The first level regards the initial modelling and creation of the template for the following two stages. The second level regards the development of code for programming integrated circuits and simulation. The third and final stage regards the transmitter's implementation at the evaluation level. In particular, more than one software and device are involved in this phase, in order to achieve realistic performance. Our research aims to evolve such technologies so that they can transmit wireless data with simultaneous energy efficiency.

However, the system design and verification methodologies that capture the complexity of multistandard RF SoC's are still limited. In this paper, an HDL design methodology is introduced for multistandard RF SoC's, which covers all the design layers from system design, to automatic extraction of the models from circuits and a systematic top level verification. The offered HDL based design methodology combines top down and bottom up design approaches, and brings the design and verification closer by reflecting the circuits to models automatically via an Automatic Parameter Extraction (APX) tool. System or block level verification is obtained with models automatically by overnight runs, without the need for extra test benches or designer interaction. This enables short term detection of functional errors or performance losses. A first time tape out of a multimode Bluetooth transceiver SoC is designed and fabricated in 8 months by using the offered methodology. The accuracy of the system level simulations show a very good match with the measurement results after fabrication. The test SoC is fabricated with 0.13 mu m CMOS technology.

The neighbor discovery process enables a BLE device called a scanner to discover another neighboring BLE device called an advertiser. Advanced neighbor discovery process is an extended version of the basic one designed to accommodate environments where there are a large number of BLE advertisers. However, the advanced neighbor discovery process has a fatal drawback. That is the hidden node problem which makes it very difficult to discover an advertiser when more than two scanners try to discover the advertiser at the same time. Therefore, how to overcome this problem is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a solution that enables multiple scanners to discover an advertiser successfully. The proposed scheme can dynamically adapt to different numbers of scanners and achieve better discovery performance. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

For mobile applications, smartphones with Internet access have become a commonly used tool to make this data remotely accessible. However, the yet presented architectures are quite complex and lack flexibility. Our aim was to investigate how existing communication architectures for smartphone/WPAN sensor ensembles can be simplified and to provide a transparent solution where the smartphone doesn't require knowledge about sensors for which it serves as an Internet gateway. We therefore present an IP-based communication architecture, that allows applications to easily integrate remote sensor data of mobile users based on existing Internet standards. In particular, our solution provides simple Web service-based APIs and does not require the smartphone to process sensor data. Instead, the smartphone becomes a transparent gateway as it only forwards IP packets.

Our system uses BLE-based ID logs to analyze daily social behaviors, such as how a child spent the day with his/her friends. Furthermore, we also use accelerometer logs to detect the period when the user (i.e., a child) was with friends or not, and what kind of activity (e.g., walking or staying in one place) the user was involved in. We conducted a five-day experiment with four families using our system. We also interviewed the families' parents and compared their responses with the analyzed results to investigate the accuracy of the above detection and usability of our system. The result shows that our system can detect the period when the child was with other friends or alone, as well as the activity (s) he was involved in.

However, the adoption of these vital monitors faces challenges such as high-power consumption and limited battery lifetime. In this paper, to overcome these challenges, a self-powered wearable monitoring system is designed, integrated, and experimentally validated. The system includes a photovoltaic panel (PV), a DC-DC converter, supercapacitors, a pulse sensor, an accelerometer, a microcontroller unit and a Bluetooth module to extract critical physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, activity of daily living and deliver wireless data access to a mobile device. A theoretical model of the energy balance model was established to realize the balance between the energy harvesting capability and sensing power consumption. In an experimental study, a 50 F supercapacitor stored 430 J in 4 hours (29.9 mW) using a PV energy harvester at 500 W/m(2), which allows the sensor system (power consumption 5mW) to run sustainably for 24 h.

In this paper, we propose a guidance system that interacts with a voice controlled smartphone interface to address this issue. The proposed system aims to present the student with a way to navigate from one location to another, in addition to an emergency system that is triggered when the alarm system goes off in any building or manually by the user. We discuss in this paper the main components of the system which include the guider application's navigation algorithm, the emergency process, the IoT features used, the data over sound functionality as well as the student's interface and voice recognition process. We also describe the results of the user evaluation process that we performed.

Current procedures in firefighting standards require several rehab activities such as measuring body temperature and electrocardiogram (ECG) for prescribed intervals during incidences. In this work, we developed a novel wirelessly powered, non-contact electrode (NCE) bio-potential sensor system with wireless communication for continuous ECG monitoring of firefighters. The system includes a passive flexible NCE ECG unit to be embedded in the base layer of the fire suit and an external unit to carry out wireless power transfer (WPT) via inductive coupling. The battery unit located on the fire entry suit provides power through a class-E amplifier operating at 1 MHz. WPT and real-time ECG acquisition were demonstrated and characterized. Our proposed method can also be implemented to obtain other physiological parameters, such as motions and body temperature, thus holding promise to promote safety of firefighters.

As most of these nodes run on batteries, discovering service providing devices in an IoT-Fog environment has to be performed in an energy-efficient way. In this paper, we propose Power Efficient Node Discovery (PEND), which is an MQTT-driven IoT-fog integration solution for the sustainability of object discovery in a publish/subscribe environment. By enabling the MQTT broker to serve as a fog node to trigger turning on/off of the Bluetooth interfaces of subscriber objects, Bluetooth Low Energy Scanner (BLE-S), and to monitor the trajectories of publishers/advertisers, Bluetooth low Energy Advertiser (BLE-A), we introduce significant reduction in the Bluetooth, CPU, and process-specific power consumption of the mobile devices. The reduction in the battery drain by the BLE interface under the proposed scheme can be as low as 10%-20% of a naive, locality based discovery benchmark whereas the process specific battery drain of the proposed scheme can be as low as 55%-62% of the node discovery benchmark. Furthermore, with the synchronization of the publishers and subscribers at the fog layer entity, i.e., MQTT broker, 100% node discovery can be achieved by the scanning/service subscriber devices.

We used beacons - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitters - as a source of signal. Received signal strength (RSS) fluctuates over time and has negative effect on localization accuracy. To minimize the fluctuation of RSS, we used methods for aggregation of RSS and elimination of inaccurate transmitters. We combined those methods with our implementation of particle filter in the prototype for mobile devices.

Anyway, in harsh environments, the achievable accuracies using received signal strength indicator measurement data are comparably low. However, restrictions due to geometry allow more accurate estimates of smartphone positions and trajectories. Based on received signal strength data from Bluetooth low energy beacons and Gaussian assumptions, an application of a discrete-state hidden Markov model - taking the geometry into account - in combination with dynamic model parameter estimation, leads to a significant improvement of error statistics.

This growth results in an increasing number of mobile applications including: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, Electronic-Health (eHealth), and Mobile-Health (mHealth). A number of emerging mobile applications that require 3G and 4G mobile networks for data transport relate to telemedicine, including establishing, maintaining, and transmitting health-related information, research, education, and training. This review paper takes a closer look at these applications, specifically with regard to the healthcare industry and their underlying link technologies. The authors believe that the BlackBerry platform and the associated infrastructure (i.e., BlackBerry Enterprise Server) is a logical and practical solution for eHealth, mHealth, sensor and M2M deployments, which are considered in this paper.

Unfortunately, in most current uses, data acquisition, processing, and streaming of data from event-based cameras are performed by power-hungry hardware, mainly high-power FPGAs. For this reason, the overall power consumption of an event-based system that includes digital capture and streaming of events, is in the order of hundreds of milliwatts or even watts, reducing significantly usability in real-life low-power applications such as wearable devices. This work presents FlyDVS, the first event-driven wireless ultra-low-power visual sensor node that includes a low-power Lattice FPGA and, a Bluetooth wireless system-on-chip, and hosts a commercial ultra-low-power DVS camera module. Experimental results show that the low-power FPGA can reach up to 874 efps (event-frames per second) with only 17.6mW of power, and the sensor node consumes an overall power of 35.5 mW (including wireless streaming) at 200 efps. We demonstrate FlyDVS in a real-life scenario, namely, to acquire event frames of a gesture recognition data set.

Because of this problem, an adaptive fading memory based bluetooth sequence matching localization algorithm is proposed. Firsly, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning(PDR) and Nearest Neighbor Algorithm(NNA) are applied to performing position calibration and Received Signal Strength(RSS) mapping of Motion Sequences. Secoudly, according to the relevance of neighboring locations, a sequence recursive search method is used to construct fingerprint sequence database. Finally, an adaptive fading memory algorithm and initial sequence matching degree are considered to realize the position estimation of target. The experimental results show that this algorithm is able to consume low construct time overhead and achieve high indoor localization precision.

Many countries have been working towards developing suitable digital contact-tracing apps to allow the measurement of the physical distance between citizens and to alert them when contact with an infected individual has occurred. However, the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps has faced several challenges so far, including interoperability between mobile devices and users' privacy concerns. There is a need to reach a trade-off between the achievable technical performance of new technology, false-positive rates, and social and behavioural factors. This paper reviews a wide range of factors and classifies them into three categories of technical, epidemiological and social ones, and incorporates these into a compact mathematical model. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing apps based on received signal strength measurements. The results highlight the limitations, potential and challenges of the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps.

A single-ended digitally modulated PA is implemented to modulate the RF envelope. A novel RX/TX co-matching method using bondwires is presented to optimize RX/TX performance. The measured sensitivity and max output power in 2.4G BLE mode are -97.5dBm and +12dBm while consuming only 10.8mW and 55.6mW. The 28.5% overall system efficiency in TX mode is a leader in state-ofthe-art designs. In 5.8G BLE mode, the sensitivity is -95.8dBm and max output power is +3dBm. In EDR3 mode, the sensitivity and max output power are -88.5/-86.8dBm and +10/0dBm at 2.4G/5.8GHz. The DEVM is 8.5% with +/- 45o/0ophase rotating data due to limited PLL deviation frequency. The 110/99dB link budget in BLE/EDR mode with low power consumption greatly extends the IoT coverage range and battery life.

No optimal trade-off, able to concurrently address several problems of the acquisition system like robustness, miniaturization, versatility, and power efficiency, has yet been found. In this tutorial we present a solution to most of these issues, embedding in a single device both an sEMG acquisition channel, with our custom event-driven hardware feature extraction technique (named Average Threshold Crossing), and a digital part, which includes a microcontroller unit, for (optionally) sEMG sampling and processing, and a Bluetooth communication, for wireless data transmission. The knowledge acquired by the research group brought to an accurate selection of each single component, resulting in a very efficient prototype, with a comfortable final size (57.8mm x 25.2mm x 22.1mm) and a consistent signal-to-noise ratio of the acquired sEMG (higher than 15 dB). Furthermore, a precise design of the firmware has been performed, handling both signal acquisition and Bluetooth transmission concurrently, thanks to a FreeRTOS custom implementation. In particular, the system adapts to both sEMG and ATC transmission, with an application throughput up to 2 kBs(-1) and an average operating time of 80 h (for high resolutions EMG sampling), relaxable to 8Bs(-1) throughput and about 230 h operating time (considering a 110 mAh battery), in case of ATC acquisition only. Here we share our experience over the years in designing wearable systems for the sEMG detection, specifying in detail how our event-driven approach could benefit the device development phases. Some previous basic knowledge about biosignal acquisition, electronic circuits and programming would certainly ease the repeatability of this tutorial.

There are two major approaches are proposed: fingerprinting and trilateration techniques.

In order to realize high sample rate monitoring applications, it requires either transmitting raw data using a high-throughput radio transceiver or performing computation within the sensor node and then transmitting a small amount of information. In relation to a energy constrained wireless sensing node, a quantitative evaluation of raw data transmission using different short range wireless technologies and in-sensor processing is conducted in this paper. The results, associated with the energy consumption of two data intensive monitoring applications, suggest that in-sensor processing resulting in a small amount of data to be transmitted consumes less energy as compared to that of raw data transmission, even under ideal channel conditions.

It focuses, in particular, on algorithm design and implementation, data acquisition, and transmission under constrained resources. A thorough investigation of the suitability of nine existing algorithms for on-sensor QRS feature detection is conducted, with respect to metrics such as sensitivity, positive predictivity, power consumption, parameter choice and time delay. Optimisation of data acquisition on CPU-based IoT systems is performed, and the current consumption is reduced by a factor of 3 using a combination of direct memory access (DMA) list approach and low-level register manipulations for task delegation. The acquisition data rate, sampling rate, buffer and batch size are also optimised. To reduce the power consumption by data transmission, the effect of on-sensor versus off-sensor processing is investigated. While focusing on CPU-based systems with experiments performed on a generic low-power wearable platform, the design optimisation and considerations proposed in this work could be extended to custom designs and allow further investigation into QRS detection algorithm optimisation for wearable devices.

The traditional TSBs use sign boards as a signal for vehicles and expect the drivers to be aware the sign board. In some scenarios, such as rains, traffic jam, light intensity, and vehicle speed, reduce the visibility of the TSBs. In this work, we proposed a smart traffic sign board system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system opportunistically advertises the TSB information to road users (e.g., drivers, passengers, and riders) using BLE.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of a time synchronization strategy from this class. The performance is evaluated in terms of number of nodes, workload of main processor, workload of main processor, and distance. We implement a measurement system and used extensive testbed experiments on BLE devices to study the performance of the time synchronization strategy under various scenarios. The result of our experiments shows that time synchronization based on the selected method can achieve accuracy of less than 17 mu s in worst condition.	[Dian, F.

We then develop a Maximum Likelihood (ML) based weighted iterative algorithm to jointly estimate the CFO and AOA from the received signal.

Time difference of arrival (TDOA) values measured with UWB radios are periodically used to improve RSS based localization. The paper contains a description of proposed hybrid positioning algorithm. Results of simulations and experiments confirming algorithm's efficiency are also included.

The method estimates the distance between the BLE transmitter and the handset by two different ways, i.e. the first one uses the pathloss-distance relationship, and the second one uses the Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) relying on accelerometers built in the handset. The location is jointly estimated by using both results. Experimental results show that the localization error of the proposed method was 1.14 m on average, which is 2.16 m smaller than that of the method using only pathloss-distance relationship.

This paper examines the use of BLE beacons for the discovery of content in mobile guides implemented as Progressive Web Applications. Cilogi is a framework for the creation of guides that run on mobile devices. BLE beacons are small devices that broadcast their identity to nearby mobile devices using much less energy than classic Bluetooth devices. The new Eddystone message format broadcasts enables broadcasting of a URL. This makes BLE beacons an alternative way of communicating the URL of individual pages of a mobile guide in an exhibition setting.

The problem is that updates can be used by attackers to inject malicious code. This work presents a lightweight protocol to update each device in a secure way. The cryptographic keys employed are fresh and are not stored but reconstructed by exploiting the Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) of the device hardware. The feasibility of the proposal is illustrated with experimental results of IoT devices that use the SRAM PUFs in their Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system on chips.	[Prada-Delgado, M.

In IoT, BLE gateways should discover surrounding BLE devices in a short time. However, this requirement is difficult to achieve when the number of BLE devices is very large. As the number of BLE devices increase, the signal density increase, and the collision problems become more serious. In this paper, we analyze the performance of BLE by considering both signal collision and density. The simulation results show that there exists the optimal AdvInterval for given number of BLE devices.

In the IPS where there are fixed scanners and portable advertisers which are sending no additional data, the RSS is the only reference for location process. Therefore, it is important to suppress RSS fluctuation caused by fading. The proposed method uses spatial diversity (SIMO approach) in combination with frequency diversity. Two different distances between four antennas were tested and for a quarter of the wavelength additional arrangement using back-side reflector was taken.

Due to multipath propagation in indoor environments, wireless technologies have to cope with frequency selective fading. Thus, this paper presents an enhanced frequency hopping mechanism for reliable interconnection of low power smart home devices. The evaluations are based on the Bluetooth Low Energy standard.

A Blind Zone Alert System Based on Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automotive sensors; blind zone detection; Bluetooth low energy (BLE); vehicle safety; vehicular networks; wireless sensor networks (WSN)	EFFICIENT; PROTOCOL	Due to the increasing number of sensors deployed in modern vehicles, intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks (IVWSNs) have recently received a lot of attention in the automotive industry, as they can reduce the amount of wiring harness inside a vehicle. By removing the wires, car manufacturers can reduce the weight of a vehicle and improve engine performance, fuel economy, and reliability. In addition to these direct benefits, an IVWSN is a versatile platform that can support other vehicular applications as well. An example application, known as a side blind zone alert (SBZA) system, which monitors the blind zone of the vehicle and alerts the driver in a timely manner to prevent collisions, is discussed in this paper. The performance of the IVWSN-based SBZA system is evaluated via real experiments conducted on two test vehicles. Our results show that the proposed system can achieve approximately 95%-99% detection rate with less than 15% false alarm rate. Compared with commercial systems using radars or cameras, the main benefit of the IVWSN-based SBZA is substantially lower cost.

Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and Bluetooth beacons are deployed in most indoor environments to provide service for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi target different applications, they both share the 2.4 GHz frequency band. The re-transmissions caused by interference with Wi-Fi packets is costly for BLE in terms of energy consumption. Techniques such as Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) in BLE addresses this problem. However, the static nature of AFH is not performing well for highly dynamic environments. Therefore, there is a need for a predictive model to optimize the spectrum usage. In this paper, we propose a machine learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the wireless activities in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and its impact on BLE channels. We apply the proposed model to analyze the Wi-Fi interference trend on these channels. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) results for several experiments on both channels indicate the high performance of the proposed LSTM model over Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) broadcast beacon is a one of possible method to broadcast a detailed information to users. However, BLE beacon doesn't provide a way to assay an authenticity of beacon since BLE broadcast is insecure untrusted communication. Out-of-band authentication is used to improve trustworthiness for such untrusted pathway. A new authentication protocol is proposed to assay the authenticity of digital signage when the information is broadcasted via BLE beacon. The authors implement the protocol and evaluate its effectiveness.

Methods A prototype wireless module was designed that modifies the input impedance of an active catheter to keep the temperature rise during MRI below a threshold, Delta T-max. The wireless module (MR safety watchdog; MRsWD) measures the local temperature at the catheter tip using either a built-in thermistor or external data from a fiber-optical thermometer. It automatically changes the catheter input impedance until the temperature rise during MRI is minimized. If Delta T-max is exceeded, RF transmission is blocked by a feedback system. Results The thermistor and fiber-optical thermometer provided consistent temperature data in a phantom experiment. During MRI, the MRsWD was able to reduce the maximum temperature rise by 25% when operated in real-time feedback mode. Conclusion This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of an MRsWD as an alternative or complementary approach to reduce RF-induced heating of active interventional devices. The automatic MRsWD can reduce heating using direct temperature measurements at the tip of the catheter. Given that temperature measurements are intrinsically slow, for a clinical implementation, a faster feedback parameter would be required such as the RF currents along the catheter or scattered electric fields at the tip.

J	Tomazic, S; Skrjanc, I				Tomazic, Simon; Skrjanc, Igor			An Automated Indoor Localization System for Online Bluetooth Signal Strength Modeling Using Visual-Inertial SLAM	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor localization; visual-inertial SLAM; constrained optimization; path loss model; particle swarm optimization; Bluetooth low energy; beacon	CONJUGATE-GRADIENT METHOD; LOW-ENERGY; INTERIOR	Indoor localization is becoming increasingly important but is not yet widespread because installing the necessary infrastructure is often time-consuming and labor-intensive, which drives up the price. This paper presents an automated indoor localization system that combines all the necessary components to realize low-cost Bluetooth localization with the least data acquisition and network configuration overhead. The proposed system incorporates a sophisticated visual-inertial localization algorithm for a fully automated collection of Bluetooth signal strength data. A suitable collection of measurements can be quickly and easily performed, clearly defining which part of the space is not yet well covered by measurements. The obtained measurements, which can also be collected via the crowdsourcing approach, are used within a constrained nonlinear optimization algorithm. The latter is implemented on a smartphone and allows the online determination of the beacons' locations and the construction of path loss models, which are validated in real-time using the particle swarm localization algorithm. The proposed system represents an advanced innovation as the application user can quickly find out when there are enough data collected for the expected radiolocation accuracy. In this way, radiolocation becomes much less time-consuming and labor-intensive as the configuration time is reduced by more than half. The experiment results show that the proposed system achieves a good trade-off in terms of network setup complexity and localization accuracy. The developed system for automated data acquisition and online modeling on a smartphone has proved to be very useful, as it can significantly simplify and speed up the installation of the Bluetooth network, especially in wide-area facilities.

Among them, expert systems have the opportunity to deal with knowledge bases dynamically varying according to real-time data collected by position sensors, movement sensors, etc. However, it is necessary to design and implement opportune architectural solutions to avoid expert systems are responsible for data acquisition and representation. These solutions should be able to collect and store data according to expert systems desiderata, building a homogeneous framework where data reliability and interoperability among data acquisition, data representation and data use levels are guaranteed. To this aim, the wearable environment notion has been introduced to treat all those information sources as components of a larger platform; a middleware has been designed and implemented, namely WEAR-IT, which allows considering each sensor as a source of information that can be dynamically tied to an expert system application running on a smartphone. As an application example, the mHealth domain is considered.

A Low-Cost IoT-Based System to Monitor the Location of a Whole Herd	SENSORS			English	Article						precision livestock farming; global positioning system; bluetooth low energy; low-power wide-area network; wireless sensor network	GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM; CATTLE BEHAVIOR; GPS; TRACKING; PERFORMANCE; MOVEMENTS; COLLARS; SHEEP	Animal location technologies have evolved considerably in the last 60 years. Nowadays, animal tracking solutions based on global positioning systems (GPS) are commercially available. However, existing devices have several constraints, mostly related to wireless data transmission and financial cost, which make impractical the monitorization of all the animals in a herd. The main objective of this work is to develop a low-cost solution to enable the monitorization of a whole herd. An IoT-based system, which requires some animals of the herd being fitted with GPS collars connected to a Sigfox network and the rest with low-cost Bluetooth tags, has been developed. Its performance has been tested in two commercial farms, raising sheep and beef cattle, through the monitorization of 50 females in each case. Several collar/tag ratios, which define the cost per animal of the solution, have been simulated. Results demonstrate that a low collar/tag ratio enable the monitorization of a whole sheep herd. A larger ratio is needed for beef cows because of their grazing behavior. Nevertheless, the optimal ratio depends on the purpose of location data. Large variability has been observed for the number of hourly and daily messages from collars and tags. The system effectiveness for the monitorization of all the animals in a herd has been certainly proved.

It is estimated that the number of connected devices will exceed 20 billions in 2020, and machine-to-machine (M2M) devices will account for nearly half of total connected devices. However, existing cellular systems and wireless standards, designed primarily for human-to-human (H2H) communications focusing on reducing access latency, increasing data rate, and system throughput, are not well suited for M2M communications that require massive connections, diverse QoS requirements, and low energy consumption. Radio resource management (RRM) in conventional H2H communications aims at improving spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Similarly, RRM also plays a vital role in M2M communications. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art research activities on RRM in M2M communications. First, we discuss the issues on RRM for machine-type communications in LTE/LTE-A cellular networks including access control, radio resource allocation, power management, and the latest 3GPP standards supporting M2M communications. Acknowledging the fact that a single technology can not support all M2M applications, we discuss RRM issues for unlicensed band radio access technologies in M2M capillary networks, including IEEE 802.11ah, Bluetooth low energy, ZigBee, and smart metering networks. We also survey M2M RRM methods in heterogeneous networks consisting of cellular networks, capillary networks, and ultra dense networks. Finally, we review recent standard activities and discuss the open issues and research challenges.

The present transmissions are emitted by dedicated radio frequency sources, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, mounted to the vehicle to determine the driver/passenger(s) proximity or relative position(s). Based on empirical data, a model of the measurements noise, which utilises skewed distributions, is proposed to capture inconsistencies in reception and the impact of occlusions on the RSSI profile in an automotive setting, for example occlusions in car parks. Experimental data is used to demonstrate the suitability of the introduced model.

There are already various technologies that can be used to gather data and more or less precisely estimate the user's location. In our work, we use Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. When these transmitters are properly placed in the environment, their signal can serve as a data input. We designed a feed-forward artificial neural network that processes this data and produces estimated coordinates that denote the position of the user. Experiments show, that our approach achieves the best average precision of 1.21 meters which is comparable to results reported by other known approaches.

The Internet of Things uses low-power wireless communication for wireless connectivity and efficient energy. Low-power wireless communication is applied to IoT for wireless connection and efficient energy consumption in various areas such as wearable devices, smart homes, and power plants in order to send and receive data and control the environment. Security is becoming more important because the Internet of Things controls real physical systems. For the security of the Internet of Things, the encryption key is important to identify and authenticate devices that are trusted. The static encryption key method used for devices is likely to be calculated in reverse through the value of the key and is vulnerable to exploitation attacks. This requires the application of dynamic encryption keys that generate keys periodically. However, in the case of low-power wireless communication, the asynchronous communication method and the packet loss make it difficult to apply existing dynamic encryption key technologies. In this paper, we proposed dynamic encryption key method that applies the mechanism of the block chain to solve these problems. Based on the history of sensor data between devices, encryption keys are dynamically generated. The proposed method is to generate the same encryption key between devices with only one step of asynchronous communication considering packet loss. The proposed method is also validated in terms of availability and security in the Internet of Things low-power wireless communication.

Thus, humans as they walk in cities pass by different beacons and the sequence of beacons form a path. In this paper, we present how those augmented paths can authenticate a user in a secure way whereby the users can prove they have passed by a path, even with current unsecure beacons. We have built a prototype to validate this new authentication scheme with unsecure Estimote beacons. In addition, as an alternative to BLE, a similar system utilizing Wi-Fi to detect user proximity is reviewed as well.

Until the 5G network will create the infrastructure for sensors direct to the internet, the connection through Bluetooth Low Energy remains the most suitable solution for Internet of Things connectivity.

This corresponds to nonlinear measurements with respect to the device position in relation to the network nodes. Therefore, particle filtering is applicable for positioning. Positioning performance is evaluated in a typical office area with Bluetooth-low-energy beacons deployed for proximity detection and report.

Fast dichotomic supervised I/Q imbalance compensation algorithm	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article							RECEIVERS	A fast I/Q imbalance compensation algorithm is presented. It is demonstrated through MATLAB simulations that with a few samples an image-to-signal ratio (ISR) lower than -25 dB was achieved. On the basis of digital processing of the received signal, this algorithm is compliant with low-cost and low-complexity wireless receivers because it does not require extra time and resources for calibration. Moreover, its fast convergence allows reaching a high enough image rejection ratio by adapting the compensation weight during the reception of a known preamble such as defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 or the Bluetooth low energy standards.

However, their experiences of system adoption or pilot testing via implementation were not shared with others or evaluated in a real environment. Therefore, we aimed to share our experiences and insight regarding a real-time location system, obtained via the implementation and operation of a real-time asset tracking system based on Bluetooth Low Energy/WiFi in a tertiary care hospital, which can be used to improve hospital efficiency and nursing workflow. Methods: We developed tags that were attached to relevant assets paired with Bluetooth Low Energy sensor beacons, which served as the basis of the asset tracking system. Problems with the system were identified during implementation and operation, and the feasibility of introducing the system was evaluated via a satisfaction survey completed by end users after 3 months of use. Results: The results showed that 117 nurses who had used the asset tracking system for 3 months were moderately satisfied (2.7 to 3.4 out of 5) with the system, rated it as helpful, and were willing to continue using it. In addition, we identified 4 factors (end users, target assets, tracking area, and type of sensor) that should be considered in the development of asset tracking systems, and 4 issues pertaining to usability (the active tag design, technical limitations, solution functions, and operational support). Conclusions: The successful introduction of asset tracking systems based on real-time location in hospitals requires the selection of clear targets (e.g., users and assets) via analysis of the user environment and implementation of appropriate technical improvements in the system as required (e.g., miniaturization of the tag size and improvement of the sensing accuracy).

It uses an ISS for simulating the execution of application and runtime-system code. To emulate the BLE protocol stack and motion sensor, we propose a novel approach of linking the stack and peripherals with an emulation library that redirects their access to the native features on the host in terms of the actual BLE protocol or sensors on the mobile device, while actuators can be rendered by animation on the mobile device screen. Experimental results show our methodology to be effective at emulating the execution of a wide range of applications on the user's existing mobile device.

We propose three methods to increase the utilization efficiency of harvested Radio Frequency (RF) energy in the beacon system, by which the energy consumption level becomes low enough to fit within the energy harvesting budget. We implement FreeBLE using off-the-shelf Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and RF energy harvesting devices, and test FreeBLE in a laboratory environment.

This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the performance of a low-cost wireless PPG device in detecting ultra-short-term time-domain pulse rate variability (PRV) parameters in different postures and breathing patterns. A total of 30 healthy subjects were recruited. ECG and PPG signals were simultaneously recorded in 3 min using miniaturized wearable sensors. Four heart rate variability (HRV) and PRV parameters were extracted from ECG and PPG signals, respectively, and compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Scheirer-Ray-Hare test with post hoc analysis. In addition, the data loss was calculated as the percentage of missing sampling points. Posture did not present statistical differences across the PRV parameters but a statistical difference between indicators was found. Strong variation was found for the RMSSD indicator in the standing posture.

This leads to the question whether a Bluetooth Mesh network could inadvertently serve the same purpose, leading to unexpected location privacy violations. We analyze the information broadcasted by a typical Bluetooth Mesh installation and show that it can indeed be utilized by a potentially malicious smartphone app in order to localize a smartphone user within a building. This is facilitated by the unique advertising address regularly emitted by each mesh node. Further, we show that implementing address randomization on the side of the mesh network completely prevents this type of positioning without having a negative impact on the functioning of the mesh network.

This combination has the potential to enable a wide range of new applications. When individuals wear a radio frequency tag, they may be both identified and localized. In thisway, the technology may interact with individuals in a personalized way. In this paper, two radio frequency identification technologies, UHF Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), are combined with a stereo-based people detection system to recognize individuals in groups in complex outdoor scenarios in medium sized areas up to 20 m. The proposed approach is validated in crosswalks with pedestrians wearing portable RFID passive tags and active BLE beacons.	[Llorca, D. F.; Quintero, R.; Parra, I.; Sotelo, M.

For such a network to become widely adopted, the sensors should have battery lives at least as long as a full farming season. While the standard low-power wireless sensor communication platforms, e.g., Zigbee and ANT, may potentially satisfy this requirement, they lack common hardware support in consumer devices. By using more ubiquitous technology, such as cellphones and tablets, the costs and complexity and be significantly reduced. Nearly all mobile devices currently on the market have Bluetooth capability, making it a viable wireless protocol choice. In addition, the recent release and adoption of the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) standard has solidified it as a strong candidate for use in very low power, long battery life networking. This work investigates how various BLE configurations affect network size, network throughput, and sensor battery lifetimes. We present a strategy to select network parameters that achieve at least a certain sensor update interval and connection latency while simultaneously minimizing the sensor's energy requirements and data latency and conforming to network size and throughput constraints. We present a simple BLE energy model created from current consumption measurements of the commercially available TI CC2540 BLE module. The combination of this BLE energy model and a simple battery capacity model allows the estimation and validation of sufficient battery life. Sensor lifetimes on the order of multiple years can easily be achieved for large update interval and connection latency sensors, which would be typical in mobile agricultural equipment.	[Balmos, A.

Under this light, positioning services that harvest location fingerprinting based on received signal strength indications (RSSIs) are widely popular due to the massive data generation that IoT settings provide. However, the labor-intensive and repetitive task of the radio map construction through offline RSSI fingerprint collection prevents such services from becoming standard equipment for future smart facilities. In this paper, we present a location-aware infrastructure that combines a broad sensing layer, edge computing, and centralized cloud federation support. Our setting gives rise to a sensing mechanism that enables in-facility crowdsourcing able to aid fingerprinting localization services. To that end, instead of extensive offline measurements, we use the facility occupants to gather unlabeled RSSI samples. To support the localization functionality, we develop a probabilistic cell-based model that is constructed by an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our black-box approach maintains the positioning accuracy regardless of changes in the underlying hardware or indoor environment. To evaluate our approach, we have deployed a multistorey facility testbed and performed an extensive real-subject trial to gather the unlabeled fingerprint dataset. The proposed unsupervised method yields average location classification accuracy of 0.8 that can rise up to 0.9 when a semi-supervised approach is considered. We also provide insights into the performance of the proposed infrastructure regarding mobility tracking, and under varying deployment scenarios.

Therefore, we propose a synergetic multi-connectivity strategy utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) discovery and Wi-Fi Peer to Peer (P2P) fast connection for agile service delivery. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive BLE discovery algorithm to enhance the discovery performance. Finally, the experiment of the multi-connectivity scheme and the theoretical simulation of the discovery algorithm show that the proposed approach excellently provides the fast service delivery with low power discovery.

In this study, a novel method was proposed to optimize the localization of an indoor BLE positioning system with low beacon density in a real-world environment. The proposed method combines three major machine learning concepts (Semi-Supervised Learning, Informed Machine Learning, and Soft Computing) in its analysis pipeline and presents a different perspective to approaching Genetic Fuzzy Systems (GFSs).

We review the basics of contact tracing during the spread of a virus, we contextualize the numbers to the case of COVID-19 and we analyze the state of the art for proximity detection using Bluetooth Low Energy. Our contribution is to assess if there is scientific evidence of the benefit of a contact tracing app in slowing down the spread of the virus using present technologies. Our conclusion is that such evidence is lacking, and we should re-think the introduction of such a privacy-invasive measure.

A beacon receiver (BR) was installed in a room near the doorframe to deteimine people's movements (i.e., entering, departing, or passing by the room), based on the variations in received signal strength (RSS) over lime. This system is aimed at providing tracking information for people in school buildings, hospitals, and nursing homes.

Being the most of the nodes mobile, the node discovery process assumes a crucial role for service seekers and providers, especially in IoT-fog environments where most of the devices run on battery. This paper proposes an original model and a fog-driven architecture for efficient node discovery in IoT environments. Our novel architecture exploits the location awareness provided by the fog paradigm to significantly reduce the power drain of the default baseline IoT discovery process. To this purpose, we propose a deterministic and competitive adaptive strategy to dynamically adjust our energy-saving techniques by deciding when to switch BLE interfaces ON/OFF based on the expected frequency of node approaching. Finally, the paper presents a thorough performance assessment that confirms the applicability of the proposed solution in several different applications scenarios. This evaluation aims also to highlight the impact of the nodes' dynamic arrival on discovery process performance.

J	Jimenez, AR; Seco, F				Jimenez, Antonio R.; Seco, Fernando			Improving the Accuracy of Decawave's UWB MDEK1001 Location System by Gaining Access to Multiple Ranges	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor localization; ultrawideband radio (UWB) based positioning; accuracy; robust positioning methods; wireless sensor networks; bluetooth low energy (BLE)		The location of people, robots, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has become increasingly important. Among the available location technologies, solutions based on ultrawideband (UWB) radio are having much success due to their accuracy, which is ideally at a centimeter level. However, this accuracy is degraded in most common indoor environments due to the presence of obstacles which block or reflect the radio signals used for ranging. One way to circumvent this difficulty is through robust estimation algorithms based on measurement redundancy, permitting to minimize the effect of significantly erroneous ranges (outliers). This need for redundancy often conflicts with hardware restraints put up by the location system's designers. In this work, we present a procedure to increase the redundancy of UWB systems and demonstrate it with the help of a commercial system made by Decawave. This system is particularly easy to deploy, by configuring a network of beacons (anchors) and devices (tags) to be located; however, its architecture presents a major disadvantage as each tag to be located can only measure ranges to a maximum of four anchors. This limitation is embedded in the Positioning and Networking Stack (PANS) protocol designed by Decawave, and therefore is not easy to bypass without a total redesign of the firmware. In this paper, we analyze the strategies that we have been able to identify in order to provide this equipment with multiple range measurements, and thus enable each tag to be positioned with more than four measured ranges. We will see the advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies, and finally we will adopt a solution that we implemented to be able to measure up to eight ranges for each mobile device (tag). This solution implies the duplication of the tags at the mobile user, and the creation of a double interleaved network of anchors. The range among tags and the eight beacons is obtained through an API via a wireless BLE protocol at a 10 Hz rate. A robustified Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed to estimate, by trilateration, the position of the pair of mobile tags, using eight ranges. Two different scenarios are used to make localization experimentation: a laboratory and an apartment. Our position estimation, which exploits redundant information and performs outlier removal, is compared with the commercial solution limited to four ranges, demonstrating the need and advantages of our multi-range approach.

However, the signal acquisition and the subsequent processing are typically outsourced to expensive data acquisition boards and complex software, resulting in expensive solutions. As a side effect, the integration of condition monitoring systems in wireless sensor networks can be tough to achieve. Aiming to overcome such issues, a low-cost and small-size electronic module to be placed in the proximity of the bearing to be monitored was developed. The acoustic signal delivered by the bearing is acquired, and the corresponding frequency spectrum is evaluated on-board. Based on that, the developed module automatically detects the presence of defects and notifies the remote controller via a wireless connection only when a fault is detected, thus avoiding the use of data cables whilst minimizing the amount of transferred data. Experimental tests carried out on the proposed system assessed the accuracy of the evaluated frequency spectrum, resulting in an amplitude error within +/- 0.6%, as well as the fault detection capability in the presence of environmental acoustic noise.

J	Abner, M; Wong, PKY; Cheng, JCP				Abner, Michael; Wong, Peter Kok-Yiu; Cheng, Jack C. P.			Battery lifespan enhancement strategies for edge computing-enabled wireless Bluetooth mesh sensor network for structural health monitoring	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy technology; Edge computing; Internet of things; Sensor lifespan enhancement; Structural vibration monitoring; Wireless mesh networks	BLE	Wireless sensor networks (WSN) offer an automated, convenient, and low-cost option for building IoT networks for monitoring the structural health of complex infrastructures. The limited bandwidth of a typical WSN is not favorable for intensive data transfer. Therefore, utilizing edge computing that allows raw data to be processed and compressed at IoT devices enables efficient data transfer to the central terminal for data storage and further analytics. However, edge computing requires an additional microcontroller unit (MCU), which significantly increases the edge device power consumption and thus reduces the device's battery lifespan. In this paper, three strategies are developed for saving the battery power of sensor devices with edge computing: (1) managing the connectivity settings of the wireless protocol settings, (2) managing the operations of the edge computing chip, and (3) adding battery capacity with parallel connections. The first strategy focuses on fine-tuning the trade-off between the WSN data throughput and power consumption. The second strategy develops two modes for power saving in certain computationally relaxing periods: Shutdown mode and Low-power mode. The Shutdown mode suspends the operations of the edge computing chip, allowing the edge computing chip to run for a limited time per day. The Low-power mode allows continuous operation of the edge computing chop at low clock speed, which consumes less current. The third strategy doubles the device lifespan by doubling the battery charge capacity using parallel connections. Combining all three strategies significantly enhances the sensor battery lifespan from three weeks to at least six months, notably reducing the frequency of on-site hardware maintenance while providing smooth data transfer due to edge computing.

To be able to record relevant biomechanical parameters during training in the field, the development of measuring systems exploiting the athlete's full potential is the key. Known mobile monitoring systems for measuring forces on ski poles use comparably heavy uniaxial load cells mounted on the pole with a data logger also attached to the pole or carried by the athlete. Measurements that are more accurate can be acquired using wire-based systems. However, wire-based systems are highly immobile and only usable when the athletes undergo a stationary test, e.g., on a treadmill. This paper focuses on the functional design of a measuring system using specialized, miniaturized electronics for acquiring data from strain sensors. These data are then used to determine the technique-related parameters pole force and angle of bend. The functional design is also capable of transmitting the acquired data wirelessly via Bluetooth to a smartphone that runs a proprietary app. This approach is advantageous regarding mass, dynamic behavior, analyzing functionality, and signal processing compared to the state of the art.

However, that method has the problem that it costs to create a database by measurement in a vast outdoor environment. Therefore, we considered to build a part of the fingerprint database using virtual space modeling received power measurement environment in a pasture. Experimental results showed that an average distance error to GPS data is about 6 m by training DNN using the database and additionally training DNN using actual GPS data.

For example, enforcing close physical proximity to a patient when using a barcode medication administration system (BCMA) can mitigate the consequences of unsafe barcode scanning workarounds. We present Beacon+, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device that extends the design of Apple's popular iBeacon specification with unspoofable, temporal, and authenticated advertisements. Our prototype Beacon+ design enables secure location sensing applications such as realtime tracking of hospital assets (e.g., infusion pumps).

Piezoelectric discs were placed in the key locations of forearm and gestures from the arm were predicted by the system using an approximator neural networks. Each approximator creates a characteristic curve and event data for each sensors correlating to each finger movement. Using a segmentator, the event can be recorded, then compared to the approximated data by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) to find the most similar, identifying the gesture. After classification, the result is transmitted wirelessly using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to a robotic hand to mimic the gesture.	[Rodriguez-Labra, J. I.; Narakathu, B. B.; Atashbar, M.

Microlocation is the process of locating any entity with a very high accuracy, possibly in centimeters. Such technologies require high detection accuracy, energy efficiency, wide reception range, low cost, and availability. In this article, we provide in-sights into various microlocation-enabling technologies, techniques, and services and discuss how they can accelerate the incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart buildings.

On-board execution of such tasks allows to identify which samples actually contain useful information. Thus, it reduces required input/output bandwidth, so that connection to the external environment can be implemented using a Bluetooth Low Energy device. The overall SoC architecture has power consumption compliant with implant-related constraints with a battery lifetime of around one-day.

Wireless Capacitive-Based ECG Sensing for Feature Extraction and Mobile Health Monitoring	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						ECG; respiration rate; capacitive sensing; active electrode; wireless wearable sensing; remote health monitoring	ELECTRODES; SENSOR	In this paper, the concept of a wireless wearable device capable of measuring electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration rate (RR) through the use of non-contact capacitive-based electrodes was designed and implemented. Both ECG and RR were measured using only the active electrodes and an analog conditioning circuit. The device utilizes Bluetooth low energy for low-power wireless communication to the remote server. The measured data is used to calculate heart rate variability, RR, and extract ECG related features. It was found that the use of non-contact active chest electrodes is a viable approach for measurement. The system focuses on user comfort and the minimization of the ratio of the number of wearable sensors to sensed physiological parameters.

A conduction-angle-reduced 8dBm power amplifier utilizing a real-time output waveform symmetry feedback (SFB) is proposed to achieve both high efficiency and robust harmonic suppression capability. The spurious emission during the startup of the TX is suppressed by a preset function of the SFB. The RX with a MODEM supports Bluetooth 5 long-range modes. Using only a total of 9 off-chip components the proposed SoC achieves 113dB link budget and 22% TX efficiency including MODEM and PMU with a 3V supply. The SoC is compliant with the FCC regulations over PVT conditions.

Many systems of which, propose the use of Received Signal Strength Indicator based location methods. The unpredictable propagation of these signals, in combination with surrounding signal noise and variable environmental conditions, makes it difficult to implement such systems as a simple entity. With the multitude of beacons on the market, it may be difficult to develop an optimal indoor positioning system for the desired application. To help address this issue, this paper compares three popular beacons, presents a simple mobile application based Kalman filter, and explores the correlation between transmit power and desired Kalman filter parameters.

In order to save power in these applications, we consider two stages for the nodes as synchronization timeslot and the synchronous task that can run on different clock frequencies. Implemented on a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chip, decreasing the clock frequency from 16 MHz to 1 MHz results in 2x and 7.5x reduction in crystal oscillator and timer run currents, respectively. Experimental results show that when the synchronization timeslot runs on the 16 MHz clock and then the clock frequency reduces to 1 MHz for executing the task, synchronization accuracies are similar to the case where only the high frequency clock is used.

In such system, single beacon device recognizes multiple users and put them into different profiles.

In the process of finding user locations in O2O services, BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons are widely used because the beacons are economical in many ways. The current BLE method does not specify the direction of user movement, but adding that information could enrich the user experience for various O2O services. This paper proposes a method that identifies the user movement direction through data analysis on data sets generated by a pair of BLE beacons. Also we demonstrate its implementation with examples of services that need the direction information of users in order to show the feasibility of the method proposed.

Secret handshakes enable mutual authentication, with the property that the parties learn nothing about each other unless they have been both issued credentials by a group administrator. This property provides strong privacy guarantees that enable interesting applications. One of them is proximity-based discovery for private communities. We introduce MASHaBLE, a mobile application that enables participants to discover and interact with nearby users if and only if they belong to the same secret community. We use direct peer-to-peer communication over Bluetooth LE, rather than relying on a central server. We discuss the specifics of implementing secret handshakes over Bluetooth LE and present our prototype implementation.

The prototype consists of off-the-shelf hardware components paired with a cross-platform mobile application that guides the user through the assessment protocol, records neck strength readings over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and saves subject records to a cloud database. A heuristic evaluation identifies improvements to implement in the mobile application. Lessons learned on creating BLE-enabled hardware/software pairings are presented. Future work includes integrating predictive algorithms for mTBI risk, miniaturizing the hardware design, and a field evaluation.

This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, and also the corresponding energy consumption. It is assumed that measurements are accumulated in non-volatile memory, and processed prior to being transmitted. The data is analyzed, and the measurements are modified to fit within a minimal number of bits depending on precision requirements. Current measurement of a Bluetooth Low Energy device is used for comparing energy consumption during compression and transmission of compressed data, and transmission of uncompressed data. Experiment shows that compression and transmission uses less energy than transmission of raw data.

To solve the above problems, a link prediction multipath Routing Algorithm based on Markov chain is proposed. It introduced the link prediction state indicator to establish the routing strategies. During the routing maintenance, the best alternative routing is selected by the link prediction state indicator.

This system consists of a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) part based on the encapsulated Application Programming Interface (API) of Apple's iOS platform and a low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fingerprinting calibration part. Pedestrian position information can be deduced from the PDR algorithm by applying distance and heading estimation and can be calibrated by a fingerprinting positioning matching algorithm. This hybrid positioning system improves the performance of the conventional PDR position algorithm which suffers from accumulated errors over time. Finally, the results obtained from evaluation test indicate that the proposed positioning system applying hybrid techniques is practical in indoor environment.

In this paper, we discuss existing indoor localization approaches, focusing on the signal strength fingerprint approaches, to which belongs the presented study and based on Bluetooth Low Energy signal. The proposed approach employs the Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to create model that describe the real signal strength-position relationship. The present method is fully implemented on a smartphone, namely, offline data collection, model computation and online position estimation. This allow updating the model by collecting more signal data, therefore improving the localization accuracy with small efforts. The presented results shows that updating the model effectively improves the accuracy of estimation.

It is shown that this method increases the achievable compression rate compared to transmitting EEG and EMG samples separately, while trading-off with the accuracy of the classification. This can be exploited in several kinds of life and health applications e.g., motor rehabilitation and drivers attention monitoring; it could be especially useful for low-power wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE 802.15.6, whose transmission resources are limited.

The single-path receiver selects the intermediate frequency (IF) at a half of channel bandwidth specific for BLE frequency assignment. The proposed IF signal processing, unlike the conventional frequency discrimination, is implemented by quantizing analog signals with linear-in-phase thresholds. The mixed-signal IF processor successfully demodulates the received signals under 1-MHz data rate. It requires an SNR of 15.5 dB for a bit error rate of 0.1%.

Various technologies exist to trace contacts that are potentially prone to different types of tracing errors. Here, we study the impact of different proximity detection ranges on the effectiveness and efficiency of digital contact tracing apps. Furthermore, we study a usage stop effect induced by a false positive quarantine. Our results reveal that policy makers should adjust digital contact tracing apps to the behavioral characteristics of a society. Based on this, the proximity detection range should at least cover the range of a disease spread, and be much wider in certain cases. The widely used Bluetooth Low Energy protocol may not necessarily be the most effective technology for contact tracing.

The primary goal of using RSSI is to provide the estimated position at the indoor positioning system. BLE consists of 40 channels in 2.4 GHz, where each channel is separated by 2 MHz. Three among the 40 channels are utilized as advertising channels labelled 37, 38, and 39 with center frequencies of 2402, 2426, and 2480 (in MHz). These frequencies suffer from nonlinear nature of path losses and fluctuation of signal strength. Therefore, this study proposes a BLE-based indoor positioning system to stabilize RSSI using the grouping strategy of advertising packets. Results show that the proposed approach enhances the system performance in terms of distance error.

This leads to the question whether a Bluetooth Mesh network could inadvertently serve the same purpose, leading to unexpected location privacy violations. We analyze the information broadcasted by a typical Bluetooth Mesh installation and show that it can indeed be utilized by a potentially malicious smartphone app in order to localize a smartphone user within a building. This is facilitated by the unique Bluetooth device address regularly emitted by each mesh node. Further, we show that implementing address randomization on the side of the mesh network completely prevents this type of positioning without having a negative impact on the functioning of the mesh network.

To achieve higher accuracy than conventional algorithms, the PythaPosi implementation integrates trilateration with two methods. The first method is to use classical physics constraints, such as client speed and acceleration. Generally, receiving signals from beacons is unstable, so some of the signals are errors, forcing us to reduce such error signals through physical constraints. The second method is recursive filtering to smooth with recursive factors, so the previous value is measured recursively in the current location. Furthermore, this method provides an excellent indoor positioning base because it facilitates easy simulations and can also be used to provide a base for interfacing with other positioning methods.

The system uses ultra wide band ranging technology and the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol to acquire data. Furthermore, a nonlinear least squares problem is formulated and solved numerically for estimating the relative positions of the nodes. The localization performance of the system is validated by experimental tests, demonstrating the capability of measuring the relative position of a network comprised of 4 nodes with an accuracy of the order of 3 cm and an update rate of 10 Hz. This shows the feasibility of applying the proposed system for multi-robot cooperative localization and formation control scenarios.

The prevalence of smartphones offers an opportunity to connect the physical and digital world. Bluetooth Low Energy beacons are small devices, which send out a signal that can be detected by consumer's smartphones to enable location-based services. However, there are very few documented cases of beacon usage in Germany, whereas they seem to have a much higher adoption in the US. In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with the use of beacons in retail.

These devices use small capacitors as energy storage, which together with the unpredictable and dynamic harvesting environment results in intermittent on-off behavior of the device. The crucial issue to effectively use batteryless IoT devices is to find a way of enabling the successful execution of application tasks in face of this intermittency. As the conventional computing models cannot handle this behavior, in this article, we present an energy-aware task scheduler for batteryless IoT devices based on dependencies and priorities, which can intelligently schedule the application tasks avoiding power failures and maintaining forward progress. With the properly defined voltage thresholds for each application task, using our energy-aware task scheduler a safer execution can be ensured. We evaluate our approach based on emulated and real experiments and validate it using two types of power management units (PMUs) (environment emulator and intelligent PMU based on the AEM10941 chip). Our results show that the energy-aware task scheduler is able to react and adapt the execution to environmental changes, avoiding power failures. Comparing to the state-of-the-art scheduling approaches, which are mostly not aware of the energy, we show that our energy-aware task scheduler can keep the device on during the full time of the experiment, executing more tasks when a relatively small capacitor of 10 mF or less is used at harvesting currents as low as 40 mu A.

At their core, location-based services generally rely on identifying the location of individuals or objects. In outdoor environments, determining the location is typically accomplished by means of GPS. In indoor environments, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based localization has received a lot of attention. Most recently, an increasing number of mobile devices are capable of supporting ANT as an alternative low-power communication protocol. Unlike BLE, however, the suitability of ANT for localization has not been analyzed extensively. We report the initial results of an experimental study to compare ANT and BLE when used for localization. The results suggest that ANT-based localization can clearly outperform BLE, when using fingerprinting as the underlying localization principle.

Starting with Microsoft Research pioneering the fingerprint approach based RADAR, MIT's Cricket, and then moving towards beacon-based localization are few among many others. In parallel, researchers looked into other appealing and promising technologies like radio frequency identification, ultra-wideband, infrared, and visible light-based systems. However, the proliferation of smartphones over the past few years revolutionized and reshaped indoor localization towards new horizons. The deployment of MEMS sensors in modern smartphones have initiated new opportunities and challenges for the industry and academia alike. Additionally, the demands and potential of location-based services compelled the researchers to look into more robust, accurate, smartphone deployable, and context-aware location sensing. This study presents a comprehensive review of the approaches that make use of data from one or more sensors to estimate the user's indoor location. By analyzing the approaches leveraged on smartphone sensors, it discusses the associated challenges of such approaches and points out the areas that need considerable research to overcome their limitations.

Antenna performance is of primary importance when meeting this requirement. This paper contributes a method suited to the difficult task of quantifying antenna performance in a body-centric communications system. In a case study, a planar wrist wearable antenna, which provides radiation pattern switching across the 2.4 GHz operating band through an innovative technique that does not require an additional switching mechanism, is benchmarked against a monopole and a patch antenna in a residential setting. The performance of the antenna and subsequently the benefits of the pattern-switching technique are successfully quantified. The holistic method includes both antenna measurements and channel simulation with ray tracing. Results are verified against real-world measurements.

Contact Tracing Solution for Global Community	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						contact tracing; interworking; SARS COVID-19; Trace Together; exposure notification; Mobile Apps; proximity identifier; global solution; Bluetooth low energy		There are several Contact Tracing solutions since the outbreak of SARS COVID-19. All these solutions are localized-specific to a country. The Apps supported by these solutions do not interwork with each other. There are no standards to the proximity data collected by these Apps. Once the international travel restrictions are relaxed, this will become an issue. This paper explores this issue, by addressing one of the key requirements of Contact Tracing solutions. All the current solutions use an Identifier, Proximity Identifier (PID), that anonymously represents the user in the proximity data exchanged. The PID used in these applications varies in their structure, management and properties. This paper first identifies the common desirable properties of PID, including some non-obvious ones for its global application. This identification is essential for the design and development of the Contact Tracing solution that can work across boundaries seamlessly. The paper also evaluates representative solutions from two different design classes against these properties.	[Narayanan, Hari T.

However, current wearable ECG devices do not provide the traditional 12-lead information needed for clinical MI diagnosis. Here, we report, to our knowledge, the first finger-ring-shaped ECG sensor that can provide asynchronously derived 12-lead ECGs by sequentially placing the ring on eight defined locations on the body. We demonstrate that the sensor performance is comparable to that of a clinical 12-lead ECG machine in a human subject study. The ring ECG sensor has an input-referred electronics noise floor of less than 10uV (peak-to-peak) with a 480X gain and a bandwidth of 0.16 similar to 156 Hz. The battery lasts similar to 5 days under normal usage. The ring sensor can also wirelessly upload data to a cloud-based medical IoT informatics system via a smartphone gateway. Combined with advancements in cloud computing, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence, this on-demand IoT ECG sensor can potentially help high-risk cardiac patients reduce prehospital delays and seek timely life-saving interventions.

Environmental factors contribute to mental illness and have the power to affect a person's wellness. This article presents a smartphone-based wellness assessment system and examines if there is any correlation with one's environment and their wellness. The introduced system was initiated in response to a growing need for individualized and independent mental health care and evaluated through experimentation. The participants were given an Android smartphone and a mobile sensor board and they were asked to complete a brief psychological survey three times per day. During the survey completion, the board in their possession is reading environmental data. The five environmental variables collected are temperature, humidity, air pressure, luminosity, and noise level. Upon submission of the survey, the results of the survey and the environmental data are sent to a server for further processing. Three experiments with 62 participants in total have been completed. The correlation most regularly deemed statistically significant was that of light and audio and stress.

In such opportunistic sensing data acquisition by mobile relaying, it is highly challenging to accomplish the sufficient quality of PM event observation. So, uRET is designed for reliable event transport from sensors to a cloud server. A proof of concept prototype is implemented for field tests by APIs of common map platforms. Test results show that uRET can support high enough delivery success ratio against movement velocity and existence situation of mobiles to achieve required detection quality at microscale urban places.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons are a promising solution to improve the scalability and accuracy of indoor localization applications. They are low cost, configurable, small transmitters designed to attract attention to a specific location. In this paper, we investigate three popular BLE beacon devices available on the market and compare them in terms of energy consumption and proximity accuracy for indoor localization services. In addition, two state-estimation filters are developed for the Android mobile platform in order to improve the proximity accuracy when using smartphone devices. Specifically, a static Kalman filter and Gaussian filter are implemented.

The power of the BLE signal is known to be highly unstable even when measurement conditions remain unchanged and statistics on repeated measurements are required in order to have a good confidence in the obtained short-range distance estimates. This work proposes a stack of corrections based on non-parametric and robust statistics as a preprocessing step on the measured data, such that both the calibration and the range estimation processes improve their accuracy. According to experiments, robust and non-parametric statistics are able to handle effectively the severe noise involved in RSSI measurements, reaching most of the times a sub-meter precision.

Recent advances in technology, IC manufacturing, and networking utilizing Bluetooth communications have managed to reduce the total power requirements of Bluetooth nodes to the newest Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) specification. Such nodes can perform measurement and transmission functions for a long time and are supposed to play a big role in the deployment of the IoT (Internet of Things). Our aim is to create a system based on BLE in order to acquire parameters that supply information to a central in-home controller which allows performing a remote device control and monitoring system for home environments.

In our previous work, we proposed an ADLs recognition system based on non-intrusive environment sensing for people in One person Household (OPH). However, the proposed recognition system did not perform well, the micro-averaged and macro-averaged precision of most of the recognition models was only around 60%. In order to improve the quality of the system, in this article, we propose a new ADLs recognition system by integrating environment sensing and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology and evaluate the new version of the ADLs recognition model by comparing the experimental data collected from a real resident in OPH.

Unlike other sensory stimuli (specifically sight and sound), digital olfactory technology has yet to have wide-spread commercial success. Our proposed system will release up to eight different liquid phase aromas (essential oils) using a thermal mechanism. The unit contains a speed controlled fan, temperature control of the heating element, and a gas sensor to provide feedback to inform the release rate. It can be connected (via Bluetooth low energy) to a tablet/computer to control the timing and intensity of the aroma. External measurements show that aromas can be detected within a few seconds of release and produce a broad range of intensities from low parts per million (ppm) to 10 s of ppm.

The system consists of printed electrodes on a stretchable bandage substrate designed to be attached to the chest, an electronics module, and a data receiving device. The electronics unit is reversibly attached to the single-use electrode bandage to measure the ECG data. The ECG data is then transmitted to a mobile device via Bluetooth Low Energy and the mobile device then displays the data graphically and sends it further a cloud for storing and further analysis. The attained quality of the measured ECG signals is fully satisfactory to compute important cardiac parameters and after preprocessing the signal could be used for more profound analysis of ECG wave shapes.

However, the calibration stage of these systems still presents several drawbacks due to the technical limitations in accurate measurement solutions. In this work, we propose an automatic RSS calibration system for fingerprinting positioning in the context of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), using the advantages of ultrasound time of flight estimations. The proposed system allows using the complete RSS distributions, improving positioning results in more than 0.3 m in static positioning and robustness in dynamic positioning. However, the most significant contribution of this work is the reduction of the calibration work by automatizing reference measurements without human presence, allowing for longer calibration times and greater numbers of measurements.

In the academic community Mesh protocols on top of the BLE topology are currently being researched. Recently, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) released a flooding-based solution. Even though the usage of a mesh network is highly dependent on the use case, the connection-based solution has a low power consumption in a scenario where some end-to-end delay is allowed in the network. Such application could be sensor networks where some lag is allowed in the data collected from sensors. This paper presents a study of the current drain in a connection-based routing mesh topology called FruityMesh and discusses its possibilities for use in off-grid environments.

A generic wireless debugging infrastructure over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is proposed. We show how it is possible to balance the conflicting needs of security and visibility in a coherent framework based on leveraging an Android-powered device with protocol stack access. The concept of "virtual fuses" is employed that allows selective access to the debug interface based on trust at stages starting from individual node development to the deployment and update of the system. The debug and security needs are solved with suitable trust management which allows selective activation or deactivation of debug resources throughout the system life. Lastly, the proposed system is implemented in a practical experiment.

The time and frequency aspects of these FSK-based specifications concern RF channel, modulation frequency, data rate, and sleep time. If they can be satisfied without a crystal oscillator, future wireless ICs can be designed that do not rely on a crystal reference and still perform standards-compatible communication. We find most physical-layer specifications can be satisfied by relaxation oscillators with the exception of RF carrier accuracy. The RF ring oscillator under test is dominated by flicker noise, which sets an Allan variance/jitter floor about an order of magnitude noisier than is required by current specifications.

They should provide the users with sub-meter accuracy allowing for analyzing patient's movement trajectory and be energy effective, so the devices do not need frequent charging. Such requirements could be satisfied by employing a hybrid positioning system combining accurate UWB with energy efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. In the paper, such a solution is presented and experimentally verified. In the proposed system, user's location is derived using BLE based fingerprinting. A radio map utilized by the algorithm is created automatically during system operation with the support of UWB subsystem. Such an approach allows the users to repeat system calibration as often as possible, which raises systems resistance to environmental changes.

With the help of widely available ambient signals, backscatter communication can even work without specialized carrier generation. The current solutions, however, are unable to identify various ambient signals. So, we introduce a backscatter system to do this. In particular, we realize the identification of OFDM WiFi (802.11a/g/n), 802.11b WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and ZigBee. Further, we implement our backscatter in the FPGA hardware to evaluate the design. Comprehensive field studies show that our backscatter can identify four protocols at an average identification accuracy of about 90%. We also demonstrate that our identification is compatible with different backscatter modulation for all four signals in 2.4GHz band.

The energy cost per bit of the RF device is only 2.9 pJ/bit, compared with over 10 nJ/bit for conventional Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitters. As a result, sensors communicating through backscatter modulation can increase their communication range at low energy cost per bit when equipped with a quantum tunneling reflector. Although the tunnel diode is highly non-linear, the measured SNR is approximately linear for increasing impinging powers; moreover, by amplifying signals below -55 dBm, the tunneling reflector achieves high sensitivities and extends by a factor of four the range of a backscatter system with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio.

A Monte Carlo simulation used to evaluate the performance of the detection algorithm shows that the approach is efficient in detecting attacks and real-world Angle of Arrival accuracy measurements show that the approach is feasible in real-world scenarios.

The desired RSS threshold is found through optimizing a metric function (for instance the localization root-mean-square-error) in terms of both the deployment information and the RSS modeling in consideration of an evaluation area. The resulting RSS threshold provides a trade-off between triggering many but less informative proximity reports with a low threshold, and triggering few but very informative proximity reports with a high threshold, and thus enables enhanced performance for some low-cost and low-complex proximity based positioning algorithms. The proposed framework is also validated with real RSS measurements collected in an office area with deployed bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacons.

Fingerprinting is a common technique for indoor positioning using short-range radio frequency (RF) technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). In this paper, we investigate the suitability of LoRa (Long Range) technology to implement a positioning system using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting. We test in real line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) environments to determine appropriate LoRa packet specifications for an accurate RSSI-to-distance mapping function.

Based on the power implications from our analysis, we present a thin, wireless, photovoltaic-powered display that is quick and easy to deploy and capable of indefinite operation in indoor lighting conditions. The display uses a low-resolution e-paper architecture, which is 35 times more energy-efficient than smaller-sized high-resolution displays. We present a detailed analysis on power consumption, photovoltaic energy harvesting performance, and a detailed comparison to other display-driving architectures.

In this case, the bluetooth MAC address of a device could be used to increase the security of pairing processes. However, current BLE devices, especially smartphones, usually use random addresses to prevent others from tracking the devices with original bluetooth MAC addresses. While devices cannot identify one another with addresses, using random address may lead to higher security risk. This study uses a smart vehicle from a major Taiwanese brand as an example to illustrate this security impact of using BLE random addresses. Afterwards, the study provides generalized security requirements based the example scenario and a scheme to fulfill the requirement.

Most existing studies have investigated the BLE. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from all channels; however, only a few studies have given attention to the separation of BLE signal information in the three different advertisement channels. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed that can characterize the BLE RSSI based on an online path loss exponent (PLE) estimation and correction for human body shadowing in all BLE advertisement channels. Corrected RSSI values are applied to both ranging and fingerprinting methods and compared to uncorrected RSSI values. The implementation results show that RSSI characterization based on online PLE estimation and human body effect in separate advertisement channels can significantly improve the positioning accuracy.

Application examples include location-based information and advertisements, logistics, social networking, file sharing, etc. In this paper, we consider positioning of devices based on a time series of proximity reports from a mobile device to a network node. This corresponds to nonlinear measurements with respect to the device position in relation to the network nodes. Motion model will be needed together with the measurements to determine the position of the device. Therefore, sequential Monte Carlo methods, namely particle filtering and smoothing, are applicable for positioning. Positioning performance is evaluated in a typical office area with Bluetooth-low-energy beacons deployed for proximity detection and report, and is further compared to parametric Cramer-Rao lower bounds. Finally, the position accuracy is also evaluated with real experimental data.

Instead of searching for an optimal tuning curve for 40 target frequencies in BLE, the tuning curve feature extraction (TCFE) technique is adopted to reduce necessary calibration times. Moreover, the initial value of each target frequency is adjusted dynamically according to previous result to accelerate calibration speed. The calibration is conducted foreground, then the optimal tuning curve is selected directly and the output frequency of PLL hops quickly in operation. The whole PLL was designed and fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the time for foreground calibration is about 80 mu s and the frequency hops without the switch of tuning curves.

Utilizing information of laborer locations leads to an increase in productivity. We propose an integrated positioning method using solar-powered Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. They are easy to install and maintenance-free since they can work without power sources. However, their advertisement interval depends on illuminance and is unstable. Moreover, there are many obstructions in warehouses, such as shelves and products, which cause signal attenuation, interference, and packet losses. We apply particle filters, map matching, and speed prediction with a neural network model to improve robustness and accuracy. We installed 94 beacons in a logistics warehouse. We evaluated the accuracy and found that our method is more accurate than a baseline method.

With the rapid development of digital technologies and competitiveness between companies in the same industry or with alternative industries, businesses tend to excite their customers to obtain the competitive advantage. Conversely, with the understanding of the competitiveness of businesses, customers change their expectation and demand for a better service and engagement. As a result, digital technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon technology overruled the existing methods of customer engagement. Though there are a lot of businesses which have adapted beacon technology to enhance customer engagement, there is lack of evidence of its adaptation in the insurance sector. Therefore, this paper aims to use beacon technology to enhance the customer engagement in insurance companies.	[Wanniarachchi, Vajisha U.; Fernando, O. N.

It uses a high resolution 32-channel flexible ECoG electrodes array to collect electrical signals of brain activities and to stimulate the lesions. Electronic circuits are designed for signal acquisition, processing and transmission using Bluetooth Low Energy 4 (LTE4) for wireless communication with cell phone. In-vivo experiments on a rat show that the flexible ECoG system can accurately record electrical signals of brain activities and transmit them to cell phone with a maximal sampling rate of 30 ksampling/s per channel. It demonstrates that the epilepsy lesions can be detected, located and treated through the ECoG system. The wireless ECoG system has low energy consumption and high brain spatial resolution, thus has great prospects for future application.

We first present a theoretical analysis of the CRC-EC candidate list while increasing the number of errors considered. We then analyze the candidate list reduction resulting from subsequent checksum validation and video decoding steps. Simulations conducted on two wireless networks show that the network considered has a huge impact on CRC-EC performance. Over a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) channel with Eb/No=8 dB, an average PSNR improvement of 4.4 dB on videos is achieved when CRC-EC corrects up to 5, rather than 3 errors per packet.

Study presented in this paper explores BLE localization performance in indoor scenarios based on a received signal strength (RSS). Firstly, we present a Ray-Launching based application to emulate BLE radio frequency (RF) signal propagation in the office environment. Secondly, an appropriate measurement workplace and its setup is proposed to measure RSS values. Obtained results are used to create an RSS-fingerprinting map. Furthermore, accuracy of position determination is calculated and evaluated. Results show advantage of BLE technology for indoor localization purposes (without calibration measurement). However, its performance highly depends on the number of considered BLE nodes and on applied evaluation method (e.g. number of considered sectors).

Although most of the light-weight devices depend on the Bluetooth low energy (LE), many human-interface devices still rely on basic rate and enhanced data rate (BR/EDR) technology. Unfortunately, BR/EDR does not offer a reconnection process, causing users to often endure long reconnection delays. To address this inefficiency, a semi-connection-based paging scheme (SCPS) is designed by proposing two additional machine states: 1) ready-to-reconnect and 2) suspended states. Furthermore, SCPS settings can be tuned to minimize the frame collisions during the triggering process. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by utilizing the discrete-time Markov chain model, and its performance is evaluated from various perspectives using numerical analysis and experimental results.

Multiple antenna design approaches for tuning on-body antennas have been investigated. The proposed antennas patch and meandered, designed for operation in the insole, exhibit a simulated realized gain of -3.98 and -1.97 dB, respectively. The antennas were fabricated on a 25 mu m flexible polyimide substrate, exhibiting up to 16% lower insertion losses at 20 GHz than FR4 PCBs. The integrated node incorporates a commercial Bluetooth low energy system-on-chip and exhibits 9 dB higher measured gain than commercial modules with reference antenna design. Moreover, through functional radio test, it was confirmed that the designed node passes Bluetooth transmitter certification tests.

Limited device density and frequency hopping based communication usually eliminates the chances of mutual interference among independent Bluetooth piconets. However, with the advent of Internet of Things, there is a sharp increase in Bluetooth-equipped devices, especially in wearable devices. This gives raise to multiple collocated piconets, thus increasing the mutual interference leading to performance degradation of Bluetooth communication. In this work, we study the latency and energy consumption by Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices under the influence of mutual interference, which has not been studied in the literature. Based on the experimental results involving 32 BLE devices, we investigate the influence of mutual interference and develop models for energy consumption and latency. These models can be utilized in future BLE enabled devices.	[Treurniet, Jan Jaap; de Boer, Willem] Technolution BV, Gouda, Netherlands; [Sarkar, Chayan; Prasad, R.

Here we report a cloud-based wearable IoT sensor system which can measure an asthma patient's exposure to aldehydes, a known class of airway irritants, in real-life settings. The wrist-watch shaped sensor can measure formaldehyde levels in air from 30ppb to 10ppm using fuel cell technology, and continuously operate over 7 days without recharging. The sensor wirelessly uploads data to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The smartphone also functions as a gateway to a cloud-based informatics system which handles sensor data storage, management and analytics. Potential applications of this IoT sensor system include epidemiological studies of asthma development and exacerbations, personalized asthma management and environmental monitoring.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is one of potential platforms and technologies for IoT applications under ISM band. Printed circuit board (PCB) antenna commonly used in commercial and medical applications because of its small size, low profile, and low cost compared to low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) technology. The proposed structure of PIFA is implemented on PCB to gain all these advantages. Replacing conventional PCB line in PIFA by the meandering line and meandering shorting strip improves the efficiency of the PIFA as well as the bandwidth. As a case study, design and measurement results of the proposed PIFA are presented.	[Cheung, Cheuk Yin] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yuen, Joseph S.

The main idea is to use the aeroelastic behavior of thin flexible films to induce simultaneously the capacitance variations and the polarization required by the triboelectric/electrostatic conversion. This technology provides thin and flexible devices and avoids the issue of electrets discharge. Our prototypes (< 16cm(2)) allowed a quick startup (from 3ms(-1)), an electrical power-flux density from 0.1 mu W. cm(-2) to 60 mu W. cm(-2). In order to complete the energy harvesting chain, we have used a wireless sensor with temperature and acceleration measures coupled to a low power transmission (Bluetooth Low Energy) with reception on a smartphone.

The spatial context (the environment in which the sensor or devices is situated) is not reflected accurately by Internet connectivity, and which is additionally not everywhere available. In this work, smart devices communicate connectionless and ad-hoc by using low-energy Bluetooth broadcasting available in any smartphone and in most embedded computers. Bi-directional connectionless communication is established via the advertisements and scanning modes. The communication nodes can exchange data via functional tuples using a tuple space service on each node. Tuple space access is performed by simple evenat-based agents. The Bluetooth Low Energy Tuple Space (BeeTS) service enables opportunistic, ad-hoc and loosely coupled device communication with a spatial context.

The state-of-the-art BLE backscatter system RBLE can work fully with commodity Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, however, the communication reliability of RBLE is still limited by its modulation scheme based on Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK). To address this issue, we refer to the modulation of active BLE radios to improve the modulation scheme of the backscatter tag. We present PBLE, a practical BLE backscatter communication system that modulates using phase shift. We conduct experiments to verify the feasibility and efficacy. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and performance gains over RBLE in terms of bit error rate (BER). With PBLE, it is possible for us to reliably read the sensor data of tags using daily BLE devices.

In this work, a multimodal AT is presented to leverage both tongue gestures and head motion, simultaneously, to interact with target devices at latency and accuracy of 10 ms and 95.9%, respectively, measured among 15 able-bodied participants. A wearable headset transmits commands wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), utilizing a human interface device (HID) protocol for seamless interfacing with various applications running on PCs and smartphones without requiring a custom driver.

The beacon signal can be broadcasted every certain interval. We collected data for line-of-sight (LOS) situation in in-room environment, and then recognize in-room presence according to path-loss readings. Data in other situations and environments such as obstructed-line-of-sight (OLOS) and outdoor scenario has been also considered to guarantee the in-room presence detection accuracy. Based on the empirical measurement results, we deeply investigate the system performance in terms of error detection possibility. This system is specifically promising for some particular purposes such as graduate seminar check-in, security system, in-and-out counting.

Almost all Bluetooth slaves are battery-powered so that they should connect with a master through the device discovery for a short time. To prevent the worst case scenario with long device discovery in Bluetooth, the events with long device discovery should be estimated in advance. However, it is intractable to estimate the exact longest device discovery time with Monte Carlo simulations or mathematical analysis because of the probabilistic behavior. In this paper, we reveal the longest device discovery time and the maximum energy consumption in Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) with a probabilistic model checking tool, PRISM. The results show that some parameters in Bluetooth LE will largely affect the energy consumption so that their design criteria will be desired to reduce the energy consumption.

To approximate the position of the vehicle, it uses Bayesian estimation able to combine three sources of information: 1) the inertial sensors of a mobile phone placed inside the vehicle; 2) Bluetooth low energy beacons, radiofrequency fingerprinting; and 3) an occupancy map. Our system was successfully tested in a real two-floor underground car park, where the system exhibits a good performance, and a robust and reliable behavior, being able to locate the vehicle and provide instructions to different drivers.

However, these devices have no means of interfacing with and controlling optical excitations sources, an essential component in photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing. Accordingly, this sensing modality has been relegated to laboratory applications only and can only be conducted using expensive photoelectrochemical workstations. To address this limitation, we have designed and validated a portable reader for PoC PEC biosensing (PECsense). The device can perform chronoamperometry while synchronously controlling an optical excitation source. PECsense is remotely controlled by a smartphone via the Bluetooth Low Energy communication protocol. This photoelectrochemical reader can be used in several different PEC sensing applications, including experiments with variable illumination periods, those that yield cathodic or anodic photocurrents, and those that require applied biases.

Channel-selection is performed with 2 complex poles centered at 2 MHz IF. The first complex pole is embedded in the passive down-conversion mixer, enabling higher in-band voltage gain and improved frequency selectivity. Built in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed front-end occupies an active area of 0.175 mm(2), it is supplied with 1 V and consumes only 400 mu W, while showing a minimum NF of 6.8 dB and an out-of-band IIP3 of -0.35 dBm.

The proposed system consists of BLE receivers, BLE wearable tags, an edge gateway and a cloud server. The system records interaction information such as entering/exiting time of an HCW to isolation rooms in the hospital. The collected data will be further analyzed to inform infection prevention policies. The performance of the proposed system is assessed through qualitative and quantitative experimental results.

We use the received signal strength (RSS) of the wireless device and analyze the accuracy of estimated position by using the weighted centroid localization technique. For a comparison trough experiments, we developed an Android-based smart-phone application to collect both Wi-Fi and BLE RSS simultaneously at the same smart-phone. Experiments were conducted on the 6th floor of the general office building and both schemes were compared at 8 points in 16m x 7m space.

Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is representative, but because of some advantages, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon devices are also attracting attention as an alternative of conventional positioning systems. It is the reason that BLE beacons are small, inexpensive and power-efficient device that appropriate for internet of things (IoT) which is a promising future technology. However, there is a problem that the received signal strength (RSS) is not stable but fluctuating. Moreover, these RSS measurements are measured quite differently in same distance by beacon device, even the beacons are from the same manufacturer. We call this problem in RSS bias problem, and we proposed a method how to find the bias level and how to compensate these biased RSS measurements.

A unique approach to the smart device is the use of low-cost wireless sensors for machine condition measurement. Smartphones may be used as the computational platform that acquires motor parameters from wireless sensors using a compatible local communication. Considering the widespread use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in smartphones, a BLE enabled sensor network was selected for this study. An experimental setup was created to emulate the industrial environment and evaluate the performance of the communication infrastructure for successful deployment of intelligent condition monitoring. The network performance measurements were carried out to assess the BLE performance with several AC and DC machines operated using different loads in a laboratory with many structural obstructions. Also, an optimal placement of a wireless gateway was explored.	[Kande, Mallikarjun] ABB Power Generat, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Meena, P.; Aarathi, R.

Therefore the integration of Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) devices is not supported. However the trend in connecting medical and health care devices is going towards Bluetooth LE which allows more energy efficient devices. This paper presents an approach for integrating Bluetooth LE devices into an ISO/IEEE 11073 ecosystem by using an Android smartphone as intermediate and introducing an ISO/IEEE 11073 compliant transcoding agent using the ontologies of ISO/IEEE 11073 for knowledge representation. By introducing an ISO/IEEE 11073 manager with MQTT connectivity, access to the sensor data is available to non ISO/IEEE 11073 compliant applications as well. This allows an easy integration of both ISO/IEEE 11073 and Bluetooth LE sensors in every MQTT supporting middleware or application framework with low effort.

Users point their devices towards each other to link them into a group (point to link). The relative positions are estimated between the grouped devices (link to group) with Bluetooth low energy received signal strength indication and the digital compass readings. The relative positions are then used for identifying the recipients for data transfer by swiping towards the physical direction (swipe to send). In this paper, we studied the possible operations to enable: point to link, link to group and swipe to send and compared Shuriken to existing techniques for user grouping and data transfer. We envision practical uses of Shuriken in collaborative shopping in a cafe, data transfer in business meetings and localisation of smart devices.

Owing to this commercialization, the necessity to append external hardware with UAV systems becomes inevitable. This external hardware could aid in enabling wireless data transfer between the UAV system and remote Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) using low powered architecture like Thread, BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The data is being transmitted from the flight controller to the ground control station using MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Link) protocol. The ideal aim of this research is to address the issues of integrating different hardware with the flight controller of the UAV system using a light-weight protocol called UAVCAN. This approach would result in reduced wiring and would harness the problem of integrating multiple systems to UAV.

This paper describes an alternative method to detect sleep parameters by measuring a variation in the earth's magnetic field. A magnetometer sensor, laid onto the body, detects millimeter night-time breathing movements by measuring the change in the magnetic vectors. A soft, noninvasive wearable sensor is designed to be printed on a miniature printed circuit board, packaged in a minimal invasive board, which includes a wireless Bluetooth low-energy (BIT) module and a low-power microcontroller. A very low power consumption is achieved by applying a smart processing algorithm, which is also described. The algorithm delivers respiration rate, apnoea time, and time in movement. A comparison with a well-known air-flow sensor is also discussed.

Application examples include location-based information and advertisements, logistics, social networking, file sharing, etc. In this paper, we consider network-based positioning based on times series of proximity reports from a mobile device, either only a proximity indicator, or a vector of RSS from observed nodes. Such positioning corresponds to a latent and nonlinear observation model. To address these problems, we combine two powerful tools, namely particle filtering and Gaussian process regression (GPR) for radio signal propagation modeling. The latter also provides some insights into the spatial correlation of the radio propagation in the considered area. Radio propagation modeling and positioning performance are evaluated in a typical office area with Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) beacons deployed for proximity detection and reports. Results show that the positioning accuracy can be improved by using GPR.

We are building a system, named RouteMe2, that provides microrouting and guidance in these environments. A critical component of this system is self-localization. In this paper, we present a system for self-localization in outdoor places (such as a train station), in which GPS signal is available but, due to shading from nearby buildings, often unreliable. We propose a new approach that uses a small number of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons to increase self-localization accuracy by means of statistical fusion with data from GPS, paired with a Bayes discrete filter tracker. A number of experiments were conducted at San Jose Diridon light rail station to quantitatively assess the performance of the proposed system.

However, there are various challenges pertaining to the sensor data processing, which makes creation of activities of daily life tracker challenging. In this work, we discuss about some of these challenges. We also discuss about some ADL tracking systems that we have developed and how we have addressed some of the challenges in building these systems.

Since the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) cannot be used in underground mines, other technologies are needed for localization. Positioning and communication options today primarily include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Ultra-Wideband (UWB), Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), etc. Smartphones and tablets currently have an array of sensors and radios, which can provide valuable information to allow indoor localization via various methods. Where mineworkers could keep smartphones with them, they can be highly effective at enabling localization and navigation. Recent applications of these technologies in underground mines have been thoroughly reviewed and examined for the likelihood of their utility for accurate localization where no other means exist. Some critical challenges and gaps that need to be addressed in future research have been identified.

Previous study did not consider the power consumption of the system. In this study, we implemented a low-power capacitive ECG monitoring system. The supply power of the system was 5V, and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module was applied to decrease the power consumption in wireless data transmission. The total power consumption of the system was 16.4 mW.

In particular, localization through the use of IoT is highly effective for watching over seniors, searching a missing child or detecting risky incidents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system of localization that can be used as an accurate monitoring device for regular use and as a localization device with low power consumption and a long span operation for emergency use. The low power consumption is realized by switching to the system operated on Bluetooth Low Energy. As a result of experiments with actual machines, our proposed system could localize the area of a terminal located within 5 m distance with 100% accuracy. Moreover, its correct position can be identified with 84.2% accuracy by using the finger print method.

Paired with a standard-compliant transmitter, the proposed wakeup receiver method minimizes the overhead in system power, area and complexity. The proposed 2-dimensional wakeup pattern reduces the latency of a wakeup event to below 100 mu s. Supplied at a battery voltage of 2V, the chip fully integrates a power management unit, a wakeup receiver with offset and noise suppression, a low power digital baseband with automatic gain control and RSSI estimation, and a crystal oscillator. With a BLE compliant signal, the chip achieves -58dBm sensitivity, and a >600s mean time without false alarm, consuming 195 mu A.

The choice of which technology is a best-fit for a particular application is not only based on the accuracy alone but also on other factors including the cost, availability of the technology in commodity hardware such as mobile phones, and the need to have a pre-existing fixed infrastructure. As such, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and therefore we provide, from a single indoor testbed, localization data collected from three very different technologies including the narrowband Bluetooth Low Energy, the Ultra-Wideband system from Decawave, and an optical motion capture system from OptiTrack. By doing so, we hope to encourage research on benchmarking of multiple localization technologies, multi-technology data fusion techniques, fingerprinting, and calibration methods of less accurate localization systems using more accurate ones.

Such networks are being increasingly used to acquire sensory data that need to be processed in real-time. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is an attractive solution for implementing personal area networks with reduced energy consumption, also because it is supported by consumer devices such as tablets and smart phones; however, it cannot guarantee a bounded delay for managing real-time traffic. This paper overcomes such a limitation by presenting a bandwidth sharing mechanism that allows partitioning the available network bandwidth between the BLE and another user-defined protocol built on top of the raw radio transceiver. Experimental results are also reported to characterize the timing behavior of the dual protocol on a specific platform.

Their devices often coexist and enabling them to communicate with each other will facilitate our daily lives greatly. In this article, we present PatternBee, a lightweight physical-level cross-technology communication (PHY-level CTC) scheme which enables ZigBee-to-BLE direct communications. In PatternBee, the BLE receiver divides received ZigBee symbols into pieces. We find that some pieces always have a phase shift of 0 no matter how large the sampling offset is. We call these pieces offset resist pieces (ORPs). By identifying the occurrence pattern of these ORPs, we propose a Pattern-based decoding algorithm. With this algorithm, the BLE receiver can decode ZigBee symbols at very low processing complexity, while achieving very high decoding accuracy. Real-world experiments verify the effectiveness and accuracy of PatternBee.

With a low-power compact always-on wake-up timer and touch-based wake-up circuitry, our test chip consumes only 735 pW idle state power at 20.15 Hz and 2.5 V. The hardware accelerated dual-factor authentication unit consumes 8 mu W at 660 kHz and 0.87 V.

However, with the development of IoT, The disadvantage of BLE is becoming more obvious. Due to only three channel is used for BLE broadcasting, the signal collision would become very serious when a large number of BLE devices is existing in a narrow area. This leads to a low scanning performance. According to adjust the parameters (advertisement interval and scan interval), the effect of collision on scanning performance could be mitigated. However, how to adjust these parameters is an issue. In order to make the analysis of scanning performance simple, we developed a simulator in this paper.

Current models of care and pathways require transforming to become more citizen focused and support greater community resilience and sustainability. This will require different approaches to innovation to improve quality of life for people as they age, reduce onset of frailty as well as support those better with long term conditions around self-management and prevention strategies.

Locality and contextual data is being captured on individuals' behaviours with increased frequency that aims to help in detecting early changes in daily living - physical activity and social patterns and develop technology based interventions to help reduce the risk of frailty.

J	Sung, K; Lee, DK; Kim, H				Sung, Kwangjae; Lee, Dong Kyu 'Roy'; Kim, Hwangnam			Indoor Pedestrian Localization Using iBeacon and Improved Kalman Filter	SENSORS			English	Article						sensor fusion; Kalman filtering; particle filtering; indoor positioning; dead reckoning; received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting; Bluetooth beacon; Bluetooth Low Energy	STATE	The reliable and accurate indoor pedestrian positioning is one of the biggest challenges for location-based systems and applications. Most pedestrian positioning systems have drift error and large bias due to low-cost inertial sensors and random motions of human being, as well as unpredictable and time-varying radio-frequency (RF) signals used for position determination. To solve this problem, many indoor positioning approaches that integrate the user's motion estimated by dead reckoning (DR) method and the location data obtained by RSS fingerprinting through Bayesian filter, such as the Kalman filter (KF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and particle filter (PF), have recently been proposed to achieve higher positioning accuracy in indoor environments. Among Bayesian filtering methods, PF is the most popular integrating approach and can provide the best localization performance. However, since PF uses a large number of particles for the high performance, it can lead to considerable computational cost. This paper presents an indoor positioning system implemented on a smartphone, which uses simple dead reckoning (DR), RSS fingerprinting using iBeacon and machine learning scheme, and improved KF. The core of the system is the enhanced KF called a sigma-point Kalman particle filter (SKPF), which localize the user leveraging both the unscented transform of UKF and the weighting method of PF. The SKPF algorithm proposed in this study is used to provide the enhanced positioning accuracy by fusing positional data obtained from both DR and fingerprinting with uncertainty. The SKPF algorithm can achieve better positioning accuracy than KF and UKF and comparable performance compared to PF, and it can provide higher computational efficiency compared with PF. iBeacon in our positioning system is used for energy-efficient localization and RSS fingerprinting. We aim to design the localization scheme that can realize the high positioning accuracy, computational efficiency, and energy efficiency through the SKPF and iBeacon indoors. Empirical experiments in real environments show that the use of the SKPF algorithm and iBeacon in our indoor localization scheme can achieve very satisfactory performance in terms of localization accuracy, computational cost, and energy efficiency.

J	Semwal, T; Nair, SB				Semwal, Tushar; Nair, Shivashankar Bhaskaran			AgPi: Agents on Raspberry Pi	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Multi-Agent Systems; Cyber Physical Systems; Mobile Agents; Raspberry Pi; Internet of Things (IoT); BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy); Fog Computing	MOBILE AGENTS; NETWORK; INTERNET; ENERGY; THINGS; IOT	The Raspberry Pi and its variants have brought with them an aura of change in the world of embedded systems. With their impressive computation and communication capabilities and low footprint, these devices have thrown open the possibility of realizing a network of things in a very cost-effective manner. While such networks offer good solutions to prominent issues, they are indeed a long way from being smart or intelligent. Most of the currently available implementations of such a network of devices involve a centralized cloud-based server that contributes to making the necessary intelligent decisions, leaving these devices fairly underutilized. Though this paradigm provides for an easy and rapid solution, they have limited scalability, are less robust and at times prove to be expensive. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Agents on Raspberry Pi (AgPi) as a cyber solution to enhance the smartness and flexibility of such embedded networks of physical devices in a decentralized manner. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) running on Raspberry Pis aids agents, both static and mobile, to govern the various activities within the network. Agents can act autonomously or on behalf of a human user and can collaborate, learn, adapt and act, thus contributing to embedded intelligence. This paper describes how Tartarus, a multi-agent platform, embedded on Raspberry Pis that constitute a network, can bring the best out of the system. To reveal the versatility of the concept of AgPi, an application for a Location-Aware and Tracking Service (LATS) is presented. The results obtained from a comparison of data transfer cost between the conventional cloud-based approach with AgPi have also been included.

ECG can now be measured off-the-person, requiring nothing more than dry electrodes or conductive fabrics to acquire a usable ECG signal. However, identification still has a relatively poor performance when using large user databases. In this paper we suggest using ECG authentication associated with a smartphone security token in order to improve performance and decrease the time required for the recognition. This paper reports the implementation of this technique in a user authentication scenario for a Windows login using normal Bluetooth (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This paper also uses Intel Edison's mobility features to create a more versatile environment. Results proved our solution to be feasible and present improvements in authentication times when compared to a simple ECG identification.

By virtue of the device design and fabrication of the switch contacts, the inertial switch in the WSN maintains a contact time long enough to wake up a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. Upon wake-up, the BLE module initiates data transmission to a remote display, when the WSN senses an external acceleration above the threshold. We also demonstrate remarkable contact reliability in the MEMS inertial switch as a significant step towards long lifetime zero-power sensors. The inertial switch output shows little degradation even after 100 cycles of testing under ambient conditions with an unpackaged MEMS device; a notable first among MEMS inertial switches.

In this context, many methodologies and technologies are used for several frameworks, including indoor localization. In this field, as highlighted in recent years, one of the most important aims of modern indoor applications in IoT is to identify how to manage and correctly convey people flow. This study aims to investigate the most common methods, technologies and applications for indoor localization in IoT and analyze the major systems currently in use and the application of these solutions to actual conditions.

Particularly, in order to control unauthorized drones, the systems to detect and track drones have to be developed. In this paper, we propose the drone position tracking system using multiple Bluetooth low energy (BLE) receivers. The proposed system first estimates the target's location, which consists of the distance and angle, while using the received signal strength indication (RSSI) signals at four BLE receivers and gradually tracks the target based on the estimated distance and angle. We propose two tracking algorithms, depending on the estimation method and also apply the memory process, improving the tracking performance by using stored previous movement information. We evaluate the proposed system's performance in terms of the average number of movements that are required to track and the tracking success rate.

By using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacons, virtual areas are divided electromagnetically according to specific service facilities for IoT service. The virtual service area is called Zone. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) algorithm applies to recognize the assigned Zone with the received RSSIs from multiple IoT sensors constructed in a real subway station. For verification of the proposed method, an experimental test is carried out in a real subway station environment. For recognition of 2 divided Zones, 10 sensors are used with their different transmitting power levels. From the test results, it is noticed that zone recognition accuracy obtains 78.1% experimentally for a real subway station environment.

The release of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or Bluetooth Smart, allows for a major improvement in data transfer using IPv6 over BLE, as proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 7668. IPv6 through BLE is widely used for IoT devices, however, connection to a raspberry pi 3 device, the most used mobile operating system, is widely underdeveloped. In this paper, we attempt to create a link-layer connection, guided by 6LoWPANs (stands for IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) from RFC 4919, between two raspberry pi 3s to transfer IPv6 packets.

It is based on the recently introduced hybrid digital phase-locked loop (HDPLL). It features direct frequency modulation of a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and a 2nd-order DeltaSigma (Delta Sigma) mixed-signal closed-loop phase/frequency detector (PFD). The Delta Sigma PFD employs charge-pump (CP) PLL front end components for analog quality phase-error detection and a 1st-order Delta Sigma ADC with dynamically adjusted digitization resolution. Digital requantization and noise cancellation facilitate low-power analog implementation. The inherent capability of the Delta Sigma PFD to provide digital frequency error detection feedback allows for robust HDPLL-based TX self-calibration against the processvoltage-temperature (PVT) variations of its analog components.

By using the counter to calibrate the frequency deviation of two-point modulation to the desired value, the gain mismatch between two paths can be completely calibrated by modifying the gain of the VCO path. The frequency modulation therefore guarantees a robust performance against PVT variations without using any additional circuit. This technique is applied to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) applications. The proposed Two-Point Modulation achieves error vector magnitude (EVM) of -29.3 dB at 1 Mbps and is implemented in 55 nm CMOS process technology. The area of the chip is 0.28 mm(2) and its power consumption is 2.9 mW.

However, their massive use is limited due to several aspects, such as the complicated user interaction or the wearing of special devices for medical identification. In order to find solutions to the problems mentioned above, we have adopted an approach based on proxemic interaction. In this context, we propose a First Aid Mobile Application (FAMA) based on Proxemic-interaction and developed with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon technology. In the first evaluation, we describe the technical aspects and challenges related with the development of FAMA. The results demonstrate the benefit of using proxemic interaction to implement HCI, in the context of emergency and rescue services, in terms of better performance and accessibility, compared with existing first aid mobile applications.

Several key technologies toward this fully insertable laparoscopic robotic camera characterized by no tethering wires or mechanical actuation linkages have been addressed. Non-contact transabdominal camera actuation is designed and operated in a stator-rotor manner borrowing the principle of spherical motors. Wireless video transmission and control communication running on onboard power have helped eliminate cumbersome tethering wires pertaining to most state-of-the-art designs and thus facilitated flexible camera in vivo mobility. Moreover, a proprietary Bluetooth low energy (BLE) application profile has been developed specifically for this camera, providing functional services in an energy-efficient reliable manner for wireless camera control. Finally, experimental results have verified basic functions of this untethered robotic laparoscopic camera and justified feasibility of the design.

However, in a large number of cases, the requirement of immediacy, such as the need to help an injured person in a hospital or to dry up water in a busy hallway to prevent people from slipping, is a major constraint. This work is based on a proof of concept in which we used Bluetooth Low Energy devices to track the location of each employee in an indoor environment. Among other factors, the location of each individual is assigned a large percentage of the weight to assign a task.

To enable the OTA provisioning for wearable devices, the wireless technologies need to take into consideration the limited capabilities of these devices. In recent years, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has emerged as the protocol choice for many wearable devices including mobile handsets. In this research, we develop technologies that enable the OTA provisioning for the wearable devices via BLE and oneM2M. We focus on two BLE communication methods: (1) Interworking Proxy Application Entity (IPE) and (2) 6LoWPAN over BLE, and evaluating and comparing these'two BLE communication methods for the OTA provisioning by investigating the performance metrics of each.

In order to mitigate interference-related problems, it would be helpful to have a method that determines to which standard a received packet belongs. However, conventional methods do not analyze the actual environment of congestion nor do they classify narrowband signals. In this paper, we propose identification algorithms and an automatic standard classification method that identifies WLAN/IEEE 802.15.4/BT (Bluetooth)/BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), which are considered typical standards in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The results show that the identification algorithms improve detection sensitivities compared to conventional ones, and the proposed method of automatic standard classification accurately analyzed the actual situation where radio waves of plural standards overlap one another.

These daily augmented touch interactions provided by such contextual information would offer a variety of applications to facilitate social interactions. Our experiment, conducted with several pairs of participants, demonstrates that the devices can identify the direction of a touch (from one initiating the touch (active touch) to the one being touched (passive touch)) with 95% accuracy. In addition, the devices are also capable of identifying four types of touch gestures with 85% accuracy using a simple threshold classifier.

This service uses beacon modules emitting radio waves based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology and provides automatic triggering of a single notification from a beacon module to multiple smartphones at proximity. In usual iBeacon systems, there is one-to-one correspondence between notification and beacon module. However, if we introduce a memory to remember the history of iBeacon detection, iBeacon systems can be extended to handle multiple notifications by multiple beacon modules with awareness of some contexts of pedestrians' moving directions, which enables a guide, for example, to the exit of buildings. We explain this idea for indoor route guidance using iBeacon and discuss its implementation with our simple experiment and performance evaluation.

In this paper, we present three smart computing applications using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and mobile Intercloud technologies. The first application is a smart roll call application using BLE, enabling teachers to easily take attendance while at the same time ensuring privacy. The second application is an ad hoc positioning application with a new BLE positioning paradigm. In this case, a user can determine the positions of other users through an ad hoc network Experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of this positioning method. The third application is a mobile Intercloud application, which allows mobile terminals to transfer data through their associated clouds (i.e., using an Intercloud protocol for data transfer). Experimental results are presented to evaluate performance.	[Ho, Yik Him; Sartayeva, Yerkezhan; Chiu, Chak Pang; Chan, Henry C.

With the recent developments in the fields of smartphones and mobile beacons, the accuracy of the IPS has achieved accuracy with less than a meter of accuracy. In this paper, we proposed and developed a Filtered RSSI and Beacon Weight Approach (FRBW) based on improved Received Signal Strength Indicator using Kalman filter. The developed algorithm takes the distance and the smoothed RSSI values between beacon nodes into consideration. We employ Kalman filtering on the RSSI measurements of the Beacon signals before applying FRBW algorithm. The developed FRBW algorithm was applied and validated in indoor environment using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and the experimental results achieves accuracy of a few centimeters localization using cost-effective and easy to deploy beacons.

To prove the feasibility of this architecture, we designed and implemented a pet tracking system which consists of the LoRa tracking motes, the fixed and portable shared LoRa gateways, a service mobile app, and the back-end service, exploiting technologies such as LoRa, Global Positioning System, Bluetooth Low Energy, Arduino UNO microcontroller, mobile app, and RESTful API. Moreover, this research evaluates the performance of the shared LoRa network and the electricity consumption of the LoRa tracking mote as well as the portable shared LoRa gateway.

This paper exploits the interaction between Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon and smartphone to set forth the fundamental building block of a beacon-based PBS system. In real-world scenarios, a beacon-based PBS system might suffer from sparse conditions when some beacons malfunction or beacons can only be deployed in a few specific positions. Motivated by such limitations, a similarity filter extended with compressive sampling matching pursuit (SF-CoSaMP) is proposed to ensure the reliability of proximity detection under such sparse conditions before smartphone proceed to retrieve the corresponding PBS. An extensive simulation with large volume of collected data has been conducted and the results prove the reliability of the proposed algorithm with high detection accuracy in an environment with sparse deployment.

Operators and building administrators are interested in locating unknown Txs for optimizing new Tx placement, detecting and removing unauthorized Txs, selecting the nearest Tx to offload traffic onto it, and constructing radio maps for indoor and outdoor navigation. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing algorithms that estimate the location of a wireless Tx given a set of observations with the received signal strength indication. Algorithms that require the observations to be location-tagged are suitable for outdoor mapping or small-scale indoor mapping, while algorithms that allow most observations to be unlocated trade off some accuracy to enable large-scale crowdsourcing. This article presents empirical evaluation of the algorithms using numerical simulations and real-world Bluetooth Low Energy data.

The accuracy of indoor positioning using 2.4GHz RF tags is affected by propagation loss caused by human body shielding, especially in crowded situations. This paper proposes a RSSI compensation scheme that estimate a crowd density level based on detected 2.4 GHz RSSI. We developed a scanner system to sense BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tag for 2.4 GHz RSSI compensation. We deployed 40 BLE scanners and over 100 BLE tags, and collected data for 100 participants at an actual event over a period of four days. Using the collected data, we estimated crowd density level that can be applied to the proposed compensation scheme based on theoretical methods on propagation loss. Our scheme resulted in 59.8% higher accuracy than simple positioning method without the compensation.

A smart watch and several smartphones are used in the measurement system. The smart watch, attached to the object of interest, transmits information such as acceleration via Bluetooth Low Energy. When the smartphones receive a signal, the general position of the object is estimated based on the signal strength. Then, ultrasonic sensors near the general position are used to estimate the position with higher accuracy. The proposed system was tested in a measurement area of 14 m x 14 m under conditions that make it difficult to measure the flow line using traditional methods. The results show that the flow line can be measured using the proposed method in an environment with many obstacles. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As typical nonlinear information, pedestrian accessibility improves the performance of the indoor positioning system. Based on a framework and related positioning algorithms of tightly coupled heterogeneous observables from Wi-Fi/Bluetooth low energy (BLE)/pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), this work presents a real-time approach for pedestrian accessibility and floor map-constrained hybrid indoor positioning method using virtual wireless devices (VWDs) on smartphones. The nonlinear characteristic of accessibility is transformed into VWDs to constrain the position estimation at the observation level. The evaluation of the proposed technique with three different criteria shows that the accuracy, reliability, and user experience of the estimated locations are comparable to particle filter (PF) results. In a typical corridor environment, the proposed method achieves 0.93 m average positioning accuracy while balancing the computational time consumption.

A highlighted point is saving power while transmitting and receiving packets using WiFi devices. Wake-on-Wlan (WoW) is also implemented to improve energy consumption, but it also needs betterment. This paper will introduce universal ideas to transmit and receive packets using low-power technology like Bluetooth or BLE (Bluetooth low energy). While looking for power-saving ways in this research, WiFi connection and maintenance also take care using lesser power-consuming technology. Identifying different use-cases where low power technology can help save energy and maintain 802.11 connection is part of the research. In addition, the proposed method discuss energy saving with unicast and broadcast/multicast data.

To do so, different technologies can be used, such as Near Field Communication, Quick Response Codes and Bluetooth Low Energy. This paper explores the possibility of implementing a mobile ticketing solution, with focus on the ticket validation process, using these technologies. They are analyzed and compared at different levels and two possible approaches proposed. Both solutions are presented in terms of infrastructure and maintenance cost, as well as passenger interaction and benefit. The feasibility and performance of the technologies is analyzed and presented in the context of the proposed approaches. As a result, a mobile ticketing solution can be implemented using different technologies, and their choice depends on factors such as the available funds, the intended interaction level, performance and the size of the target audience.

As a result, a number of mechanisms to contain the pandemic have been devised. Popular among these are contact tracing to identify contacts and carry out tests on them in order to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. However, manual contact tracing is tedious and time consuming. Therefore, contact tracing based on mobile applications have been proposed in literature. In this paper, a cross platform contact tracing mobile application that uses deep neural networks to determine contacts in proximity is presented. The application uses Bluetooth Low Energy technologies to detect closeness to a Covid-19 positive case. The deep learning model has been evaluated against analytic models and machine learning models. The proposed deep learning model performed better than analytic and traditional machine learning models during testing.

As buildings have different roles with different requirements and characteristics, new approaches are required to increase the efficiency of new and old buildings to reduce consumption. Locating people inside buildings can be done using cameras, sensors, or radio signal strengths, where their intrusion may vary. In this paper, we present our approach to locating building occupants using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Scanners without previously requiring the fingerprint of the area where the system is deployed. To do it, we created a Machine Learning pipeline to locate the devices. Using our approach, we obtained an average error of 5.68m. We also demonstrate that rotating the positions of the Scanners while maintaining their distances does not have an impact on the location accuracy.

The custom fit, combined with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology and small battery size make this device ideal for wearable applications. Wearable biofeedback devices are used in clinical and psychological research, usability testing, human-machine interface, and many other applications. The device displays real-time data on any android phone running Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later and saves the data directly to the phone's internal storage for display.

Among these technology, the UWB provides features of a low power consumption and high positioning accuracy caused by good immunity to multi-path fading. However, the performance of positioning feature is deteriorated in non-line of sight (NLOS) channel. Therefore, the identification of non-line of sight (NLOS) in UWB channel is required to verify and enhance the effects of UWB positioning. In this paper, we identify NLOS by measuring signal strengths on the first path and multi-path and estimate the distance from UWB anchor to a tag in through-the-wall and hard-NLOS channels. The results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently identified NLOS in UWB channel environments.

In this paper, we quantify this notion using "proximity zone", and propose a methodology that empirically and systematically compare the proximity zones created by various wireless technologies. We find that existing technologies such as 802.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and RFID fall short on metrics such as boundary sharpness, robustness against interference, and obstacle penetration. We then present the design and evaluation of a wireless proximity detection platform based on magnetic induction - Live Synergy. Live Synergy provides sweet spot for indoor applications that require reliable and precise proximity detection.

However, the current indoor positioning technology is not ideal in the engine room environment in the face of the complex electromagnetic environment and spatial structure. In order to improve the positioning accuracy, this paper proposes a Bluetooth indoor positioning strategy for ship cabin based on hierarchical area (BSSH) for deploying and dividing the regions requiring indoor positioning and combines Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with Bluetooth fingerprint positioning technology. Processing the fingerprint library by using region hierarchy and proximity classification algorithms to obtain reliable results in the ship environment, the results show that better Beacon deployment and hierarchical area algorithms can lead to a localization accuracy of 80.38%.

With the use of extrusion-based 3D printers, we produced a model that printed both the resistive circuits and a complete insole simultaneously. These distinctive technologies have given us the capability to capture valuable pressure data from the insole of the foot. Analog signals sent from the pressure sensor arrays are received and processed through an attached multiplexer designed specifically for this application. The signal is then digitized and transmitted over the SPI to a micro controller via Bluetooth Low Energy, to an android device to allow the user to easily record and interpret the pressure data in real-time. The android device houses a pressure mapping view to show the gradient of force throughout the insole.

As technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Apple's iBeacon protocols begin to see widespread adoption, we will no doubt see a proliferation of indoor location enabled application experiences. While not essential to each of these applications, many will require that the location of the device be true and verifiable. In this paper, we present LocAssure, a new framework for trusted indoor location estimation. The system leverages existing technologies like BLE and iBeacons, making the solution practical and compatible with technologies that are already in use today. In this work, we describe our system, situate it within a broad location assurance taxonomy, describe the protocols that enable trusted localization in our system, and provide an analysis of early deployment and use characteristics. Through developer APIs, LocAssure can provide critical security support for a broad range of indoor location applications.

In this paper, Smart Fall is presented. It is a new accelerometer-based fall detection system integrated into an intelligent building. The developed system consists of two main components. Fall detection is realized inside a small customized wearable device that is characterized by low costs and low-energy consumption. Additionally, a receiver component is implemented which serves as mediator between the wearable device and a Smart Home environment. The wireless connection between the wearable and the receiver is performed by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. OpenHAB is used as platform-independent integration platform that connects home appliances vendor- and protocol-neutral. The integration of the fall detection system into an intelligent home environment offers quick reactions to falls and urgent support for fallen people.

The technical characteristics of micro. sp (c) are compared with those of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices, which appears as the main competing short range wireless technology. Experimental results show that micro. sp (c) can be considered an enabling technology for the implementation of very low consumption short-range devices (according to ETSI definition). To give some examples, measurements have revealed that assuming to transmit few bytes every 30 seconds, a micro. sp (c) device can work for more than 30 years with the same coin battery, more than double the time of the BLE devices.

The app features dual-mode, where the passive mode uses GPS, and the active mode with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to solve contact information respectively. Thanks to blockchain technology, it solves third-party trust concerns and opens up anonymous data sharing for COVID-19 protection and beyond by adopting BeepTrace approach as an open platform of health/disease tracing data. At present, we have released the alpha version of the app with the preliminary realization of relevant functions. We believe this application will have significant implications for the global response to the pandemic of and beyond COVID-19.

Given the ubiquity and popularity of smartphones in modern distributed applications, clock discrepancies often lead to degraded application performance. In this paper, we present and evaluate alternative approaches to attain precise time synchronization by leveraging the various peripherals available on modern smartphone devices. Our evaluation across Android smartphones typically attains synchronization accuracy within (i) 200 mu s using audio, (ii) 3000 mu s using Bluetooth Low Energy, and (iii) 1000 mu s using Wi-Fi. Under certain conditions, we show that smartphones synchronized using one peripheral can accurately timestamp and generate synchronous events over other peripherals. The provided guide and accompanying open-source implementations offer developers a means to select the appropriate time synchronization technique when building distributed applications.

The estimated parameters include activity type (run/walk/rest), forward distance, and average moving speed. These parameters are calculated and displayed on the user's smartphone. Different from previous works, IMU data is collected to train a compact neural network model for running gait classification. The performance of model prediction and other measurements is evaluated with a customized database of 600 data segments. Experimental results show that our model achieves a high accuracy of 99.35% on gait classification. Other measures for moving analysis such as the total forward distance and the average speed are retrieved with a low maximum error of less than 4.67% and 4.80% respectively.

Most common problems faced by developers while developing end applications is interfacing the sensors and actuators, working with IoT Software Development Kits (SDK) like Azure IoT SDK, Amazon AWS SDK and connectivity stacks. Many sensor vendors do provide sensor drivers, but user has to research and access multiple sources to get the necessary information and source code. Developer has to spend efforts in porting or interfacing the driver to his Micro Controller (MCU) platform. Portability also becomes important to protect software investments for future. This paper discusses about SDK for MCUs, Plugins for MCU SDKs, and provides details on how they simplify efforts for the developers in rapidly prototyping IoT end applications.

The system was evaluated by 10 test walks along an 80m long indoor track including stairs and running. 95% of the time the average error for a particle was below 3.1 m with filter completion success rate of 90%. Furthermore, a system without UWB using only IMU, BLE and map matching achieved an average error for a particle to be below 3.6 m with filter completion success rate of 70%.

J	Naghdi, S; O'Keefe, K				Naghdi, Sharareh; O'Keefe, Kyle			Detecting and Correcting for Human Obstacles in BLE Trilateration Using Artificial Intelligence	SENSORS			English	Article						trilateration; BLE; artificial intelligence; localization; obstacle		One of the popular candidates in wireless technology for indoor positioning is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). However, this technology faces challenges related to Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fluctuations due to the behavior of the different advertising channels and the effect of human body shadowing among other effects. In order to mitigate these effects, the paper proposes and implements a dynamic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that uses the three different BLE advertising channels to detect human body shadowing and compensate the RSSI values accordingly. An experiment in an indoor office environment is conducted. 70% of the observations are randomly selected and used for training and the remaining 30% are used to evaluate the algorithm. The results show that the AI model can properly detect and significantly compensate RSSI values for a dynamic blockage caused by a human body. This can significantly improve the RSSI-based ranges and the corresponding positioning accuracies.

Knowing a building's occupancy plays a crucial role in implementing demand-response HVAC. In this paper we propose a new solution based on the iBeacon technology. This solution is different from the previous ones because it leverages on the Bluetooth Low Energy standard, which provides lower power consumption. Moreover, the iBeacon protocol can be used both on iOs systems and Android ones, making this new approach portable. Differently from our previous work based on iOS devices, in this paper we focus on an Android based solution with the aim of increasing the accuracy of the location and the energy efficiency of the entire system. We increased the accuracy by 10% and the energy efficiency by 15%.	[Corna, A.; Fontana, L.; Nacci, A.

In order to provide scalability, one promising way to collect data from BLE sensors is to utilize the existing population of smartphones in their range as relays to the cloud. In this case, providing reliable data transfer becomes complicated due to challenges such as the varying smartphone density, the sleep cycle of the sensors, and the varying Internet connectivity or unreliability of the smartphones. Therefore, this paper proposes a reliable data transfer protocol that builds upon some of the principles of TCP to address the aforementioned challenges. The protocol is evaluated using computer simulations and a hardware prototype is implemented. The evaluations not only show that the proposed protocol provides reliable data transfer, but also how to configure the parameters of the protocol to ensure energy-efficiency.

In order to realize the indoor positioning with these communication systems, techniques such as fingerprinting, trilateration, and triangulation have been widely studied. Even though fingerprinting has been chosen as a representative approach in many literatures, it is known as tedious and time consuming method due to the long-time location learning phase. Therefore, the fingerprinting is expected to be integrated with other methods to enhance the location accuracy and reduce the location estimation procedures. In this work, we discuss one of these methods used for indoor positioning, i.e., weighted centroid localization (WCL) using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) observed from neighboring BLE beacons. The WCL is evaluated in our testbed building and analyzed to configure its parameters for indoor positioning.

This analysis needs specialized modulation and demodulation circuits and hence requires dedicated hardware. Contrary to this, we present a coarse radar approach that can be implemented exclusively with low-cost off-the-shelf RF chipsets. The proposed method utilizes the Received Signal Strength of a discrete frequency chirp in order to resolve pairs of reflection components with common Time of Flight differences. The technique is derived in detail and it is shown that these information can be used to approximate absolute reflection depths. The real-world functionality of this low-cost radar approach is demonstrated by an experimental setup. Using standard Bluetooth Low Energy components, we extract the impact of environmental changes under certain reflection depths out of measured field strength data.

Both of them operate in the Ultra High Frequency range, at different frequencies (865-928 MHz and 2400 MHz respectively). For the lower frequencies (865-928 MHz) a passive tag was used. Instead, for the higher frequencies an active tag using Bluetooth Low Energy protocol has been designed. These systems have been successfully tested in South America for access control applications. Currently, IES is working to realize technical solutions that employ metamaterial technology, in order to reduce the antenna dimensions.

Given the ubiquity and popularity of smartphones in modern distributed applications, clock discrepancies often lead to degraded application performance. In this paper, we present and evaluate alternative approaches to attain precise time synchronization by leveraging the various peripherals available on modern smartphone devices. Our evaluation across Android smartphones typically attains synchronization accuracy within (i) 200 mu s using audio, (ii) 3000 mu s using Bluetooth Low Energy, and (iii) 1000 mu s using Wi-Fi. Under certain conditions, we show that smartphones synchronized using one peripheral can accurately timestamp and generate synchronous events over other peripherals. The provided guide and accompanying open-source implementations offer developers a means to select the appropriate time synchronization technique when building distributed applications.

It is natural, because the physical layout in these applications is linear; it is suitable, because it supports the functionality of these applications, e.g. fast detection of convoy splits, network clustering, and routing between network nodes. In this paper, we propose an approach for the dynamic establishment and repair of an overlay line topology in wireless networks. To form this topology, only stable bidirectional links, i.e. links that are sufficiently reliable in both directions, are selected. For this purpose, we present an approach for the dynamic detection and statistical assessment of links. We have devised a protocol for both approaches, and have implemented, deployed, and tested this protocol on an industrial hardware platform using Bluetooth Low Energy.

The design and construction of the device are discussed. The authors have considered the best placement of the sensor, on the body, to gain the most accurate readings of user stress levels, under various conditions. Trial tests were performed on a group of sixteen people to verify the correct functioning of the device. Resistance levels were compared to those from the reference system. The placement of the sensor has also been determined, based on wearer convenience. With the Bluetooth Low Energy block, users can be notified immediately about their abnormal stress levels via a smartphone application. This can help people with ASD, and those who work with them, to facilitate stress control and make necessary adjustments to their work environment.

Prosthetic hands are often used for the reconstruction of the function of the fingers of upper limb amputees. There are many patients who wish to wear myoelectric prosthetic hands. However, it is not popular now in Japan. Hoshikawa et al. developed simplified myoelectric prosthetic hand as an easy-to-use one. However, it has problems with learning speed and scalability. In this research, Shadow System BLE was developed to solve the problem. This system can perform learning calculation and identification on a smartphone connected by Bluetooth Low Energy. We confirmed that it can perform learning calculation at high speed using abundant computing resources and can demonstrate the same identification rate as conventional system. Normally, since the smartphone is connected to the Internet, it is possible to use the server for identification or to use the Web API in the future.

Targeting low power and minimum die size, while excluding RF-options and minimizing the count of external components for low-cost, asks for appropriate architectural choices to obtain high performance. Fast PLL locking and immediate RX-TX turn-around minimize the consumption overhead at wake-up and turn-around. With a die size of only 1.95mm(2) in a 90nm standard digital CMOS technology, the receiver achieves a sensitivity of -94.5dBm (1Mbps, BER 10E-3) while consuming only 7.1mA and the transmitter consumes 9.2mA for OdBm output power. The base-band is compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, the Bluetooth Smart standard (former Bluetooth low energy BLE) and can be configured for proprietary standards at 2.4GHz, with data-rates up to 3Mbps.

The sensor, which consists of a tri-axial accelerometer, a microcontroller and a Bluetooth Low Energy transceiver, can be worn anywhere on a subject's torso and in any orientation. In order to distinguish easily between falls and activities of daily living (ADL), a possible fall is detected only if an impact is detected and if the subject is horizontal shortly afterwards. As an additional criterion to reduce false positives, a fall is confirmed if the user activity level several seconds after a possible fall is below a threshold. Intentional falls onto a gymnastics mat were performed by 10 volunteers (total of 297 falls); ADL were performed by 15 elderly volunteers (total of 315 ADL). The fall detection algorithm provided a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100%.

However, the traditional data acquisition schemes with mobile assistance suffer from the poor communication channel quality of BLE. So, it is tough to achieve enough reliability of event observation. Hence, cRET utilizes overhearing-based collaboration among sensors to improve the data delivery ratio. It also could support reliable transmission over mobile devices despite high-speed moving. A proof-of-concept demonstrates that the reliability is improved by the overhearing and collaboration among sensors against low-channel conditions and a high moving speed of mobile devices, i.e., 30 km/h and more.

A key characteristic of these smart buildings is to provide indoor navigation and localization services to its occupants. As this demand increases, simple, scalable solutions are sought after. Current localization technologies, such as GPS, do not work in indoor environments, nor does it provide the level of accuracy required for an effective indoor navigation solution. This paper explores the feasibility of a wireless indoor location system based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons (BLE). Five popular BLE beacon devices are compared in terms of energy consumption and proximity accuracy. Experiments are conducted in three different rooms and three filtering techniques are also examined, to improve the performance of each beacon. According to experimental results, a proper selection of the filtering technique can help to improve their proximity estimation.

Typically, data transmitted by BLE sensors would be collected by smartphones within their range and uploaded to the cloud. In this case, there is a probability that sensor data is lost if there are no smartphones present at the time of transmission. Eventually, this may cause significant gaps in the data collected at the cloud. This paper addresses this challenge through a novel scheduling algorithm for BLE sensors that uses binary trees to reduce the gaps in collected data, while considering varying smartphone density. The algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations and a hardware prototype is implemented. The evaluations illustrate that gaps are indeed reduced in the collected data, and shows how the parameters of the protocol can be configured in different conditions.

The system implements a battery-less device that, by using a TEG, harvests energy from a thermal gradient and it is able to perform measurements with the same transducer. The device implements a conditioning circuit to harvest energy using an ultra-low-power system on chip (SoC) provided by STMicroelectronics. The SoC plays the role of sensing the harvested energy to activate a Bluetooth Low Energy radio as soon as the harvested energy is enough for transmission. The measuring method exploits the proportionality between the thermal gradient and the frequency ofthe transmitted beacons. The reading of the measurement data uses a convenient time-domain readout approach. Results and experiments evince the suitability of the proposed solution with the possibility to adopt and disseminate the device in various environments and for application in an industrial scenario.

This is because Bluetooth consumes much less power than WiFi which results in longer battery life. The higher power consumption of WiFi devices is due to overheads from either establishing or maintaining connections with the access point. Surprisingly, Bluetooth devices require nearly three times as much energy to transmit a bit of data at the physical layer than WiFi devices. In this paper, we propose Wi-LE a WiFi-compatible communication system that avoids the power hungry process of establishing or maintaining a connection. We implement and evaluate Wi-LE using an off-the-shelf WiFi module. Our results show that Wi-LE has power consumption similar to that of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

One such exploitable vulnerability is Denial of Service (DoS). In this paper, we showcase our preliminary efforts towards study of various forms of DoS and how it can be exploited in different protocols of IoT. We propose our initial attack and defense framework for IoT and that can perform various forms of DoS on IP and Bluetooth. We show the initial results of DoS vulnerabilities such as Resource Exhaustion and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Packet Injection. In order to understand how resilient is IoT for DoS, we propose a new metric to measure the Resilience against DoS in IoT. We have conducted a real time experimentation with IoT devices in our security IoT testbed. The experiments conducted are for DoS, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) by setting up Mirai and Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) using BrickerBot on various IoT devices.

Existing low-power wireless network architectures are designed in isolated networks, and ensure a satisfying level of performance in homogeneous networks. However, with co-existence of different low-power networks, the interoperability related problems arise. To bridge this gap in this paper, we study various protocol stacks (i.e., Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN and IEEE 802.15.6), and explain their specific features. Furthermore, we provide a generic protocol stack design that facilitates multiple radios with different protocol stacks, regardless of being IP-based or non-IP-based networks. We see this approach as a possibility to enhance network performance in terms of reliability, timeliness, and security, while providing higher levels of scalability and connectivity.

Basic Bluetooth analysis inside consumer hardware such as smartphones can be accomplished observing the Host Controller Interface (HCI) between the operating system's driver and the Bluetooth chip. However, the HCI does not provide insights to tasks running inside a Bluetooth chip or Link Layer (LL) packets exchanged over the air. As of today, consumer hardware internal behavior can only be observed with external, and often expensive tools, that need to be present during initial device pairing. In this paper, we leverage standard smartphones for on-device Bluetooth analysis and reverse engineer a diagnostic protocol that resides inside Broadcom chips. Diagnostic features include sniffing lower layers such as LL for Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), transmission and reception statistics, test mode, and memory peek and poke.

However, to set up a direct link between two neighboring nodes, they have first to detect each other, which introduces a delay before they can start sending and receiving data. The link establishment delay can be particularly unfavorable in situations of strong mobility, as the availability of the direct communication link depends on how long the devices stay within communication range of each other. This paper reports on our experiments to evaluate the link establishment delay. We focus on Android devices and use the Nearby Connection Application Programming Interface (API), which supports Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to perform link connectivity. In a nutshell, we observe that the link establishment delay requires several seconds to complete in the case of Bluetooth Classic and even tens of seconds for BLE.

The use of standard Human-Interface Device (HID) profile enables plug-and-play of the proposed mouse device on modern computers without requiring separate driver installation. It can be used in two different modes to move the cursor, the joystick mode and the direct mapped mode.

An app on the smart phone will process the signal and predict the blood pressure value. The morphological method and adaptive filter is implemented in the app to improve the signal quality. By using the extracted features from PPG signal, the BP can be predicted based on the sparse Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) model. The users can observe the real-time BP and HR on the mobile phone. The measured mean absolute error (MAE) from an experiment involving 20 subjects is 7.1 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

By combining tag localization with its identification capability, new features can be associated with each detected object, extending the set of potential applications. The main problem consists in the association between wireless tags and objects due to the intrinsic limitations of Received Signal Strength Indicator-based localization approaches. In this paper, an experimental comparison between two specific technologies is presented: passive UHF Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). An automatic calibration process is used to model the relationship between RSSI and distance values. A robust data association method is presented to deal with complex outdoor scenarios in medium sized areas with a measurement range up to 15m. The proposed approach is validated in crosswalks with pedestrians wearing portable RFID passive tags and active BLE beacons.	[Llorca, D.

Appropriate use of a harness can be the difference between an incident or a critical accident. Monitoring the proper use of a harness in the workplace using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices is a recent and effective approach. The aim of this article is to identify typical limitations in a BLE monitoring system in order to propose solutions according to the existing literature. Alternative solutions found in the literature showed that the integration of BLE with other technologies such as building information modeling, radio-frequency identification or the global positioning system can improve the effectiveness of current monitoring approaches based only on BLE and reduce rates of fall from height accidents. For correct integration, both technological factors (cost, compatibility, data transmission) and cultural factors (social acceptance, procedures, etc.) must be taken into account.

This paper presents a generic received-signal-strength (RSS) threshold optimization framework for generating informative proximity reports. The proposed framework contains five main building blocks, namely the deployment information, RSS model, positioning metric selection, optimization process and management. Among others, we focus on Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based RSS models and positioning metric computation. The optimal RSS threshold is found through minimizing the best achievable localization root-mean-square-error formulated with the aid of fundamental lower bound analysis. Computational complexity is compared for different RSS models and different fundamental lower bounds. The resulting optimal RSS threshold enables enhanced performance of new fashioned low-cost and low-complex proximity report-based positioning algorithms. The proposed framework is validated with real measurements collected in an office area where bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) beacons are deployed.

Accordingly, demands for cost-effective and portable fNIRS systems capable of hyperscanning studies have been growing. To this end, we implemented a wireless fNIRS system with multiple connections based on Bluetooth technology in the present study. The implemented fNIRS system adopted the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol enabling lower power consumption and supporting wireless connections between master-slave modules up to seven. The implemented fNIRS system was validated by an experiment composed of typical tasks inducing distinct hemodynamic changes. Task-related hemodynamic changes were collected concurrently from the prefrontal cortex using different slave modules equipped on different participants. Experimental results underpin the fact that different slave modules successfully collected and transferred the data simultaneously and the master module could adequately process the received data.

This uses an array of sensors distributed in the path. When the object with identification tag passes through the path, the sensors calculate the approximate distance from each of them with the help of a series of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values. The data is collected and is displayed on a user interface provided. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is used in the wireless sensor network. The RSSI values are mapped to corresponding distances by an initial training and this data is used for estimation of the distance. Path loss exponent and curve fitting methods are proposed for estimation of distance from the initial training data. Further, an error reduction method is also proposed for improving the accuracy of the estimation.

We analyze two positioning techniques, fingerprinting and particle filtering, for two usage scenarios. The first scenario refers to a corridor with beacons placed along a straight line at equal distances one from another. The second scenario refers to a generic room divided in imaginary cells with beacons placed in the corners and the center of the room. For the first scenario, the best results were obtained using particle filtering which provided an accuracy of less than 2 meters. For the second scenario, fingerprinting provided the best accuracy with an error of about 2 meters. The results suggest that the particularities of a room may provide different outcomes, thus the characteristics of the room should be clearly defined.

Interaction with a certain proximity and thing is bringing smarter services into our daily lives through cyber-physical world collaboration. Push notification of meaningful content associated with the proximity or thing is one of key technologies of the cyber-physical services. For example, empty parking spot recommendation in a parking lot or promotion coupon notification of a shop at a shopping cent er should be delivered accordingly. This paper explores reliable push notification of content for novel interactive mobile applications over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon infrastructure. Since mobile users move around with different speeds, this paper deals with such difference to relay right content in a reliable manner, called Reliable Push Notification (RPN). RPN dynamically clusters contents and links them to a beacon to achieve reliability, and then adaptively pre-allocate contents for transmission.

The RTL system can monitor the location and movement of multiple laborers in real time. A portable RTL system with a low-battery mode was developed to accommodate various constraints in the construction site. A conventional RTL system that uses radio signal strength indicators (RSSIs) has high error, so an accelerometer with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was added, and a calculation process is suggested. Field tests were performed for validation in underground construction and bridge overlay sites. The results show that the accelerometer and BLE can be used as effective sensors to detect the movement of laborers. When the sensor is fixed, the average error ranges 0.2-0.22 m, and when the sensor is moving, the average error ranges 0.1-0.47 m.

This paper presents the development of an early drowning detection system based on the Bluetooth Low Energy technology and the received signal strength-based localization method that allows lifeguards to monitor the position of swimmers in real time. Swimmers wearing Bluetooth tags are monitored by four Bluetooth beacon scanners installed in the swimming area. The wearable Bluetooth tags periodically send beacon signals to the Bluetooth beacon scanners. Locations of swimmers are estimated using an improved RSSI-based algorithm. The radio links between Bluetooth tag and beacon scanners will be interrupted when the victim is submerged under water for certain duration. Sirens placed in the monitored area are then triggered to alert lifeguards about drowning accident. The proposed system helps to narrow down the search area and reduce the rescue time when drowning occurs.

Although there is a significant amount of research targeting indoor localization technologies and their performance, most of these efforts only focus on theory, system design or evaluation in non-industrial environments, usually offices or healthcare spaces. In this work, a detailed performance evaluation of two commercially available accurate localization technologies, based on Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB), in an industrial environment is presented to create an experimental understanding of their behaviour in similar conditions and to investigate their potential to be used in industrial applications with concrete localization requirements. For this purpose, these localization technologies are examined with respect to various performance criteria in several scenarios in a real industrial site.

Existing higher capacity link (e.g., Bluetooth Classic, WiFi) however requires high connection setup cost. To deal with this dilemma, we propose to bundle multiple data transmission requests and send the aggregated data at once to reduce energy consumption for link setup. Where the concept of bundling has been widely used for cloud storage services, existing schemes do not consider energy efficiency. In this paper, we present three bundling algorithms that try to balance the reduction of energy consumption and the extension of delivery delay by adapting to the current data request pattern. We perform extensive evaluation by using the realistic parameters that are obtained via experimental measurements by using a latest commercial smart watch.

However, the privacy issues involved in the use of contact tracing apps have also attracted people's attention. First, we divide contact tracing techniques into two types: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based and Global Positioning System (GPS) based techniques. In order to clear understand the system structure and its elements, we create data flow diagram (DFD) of each types. Second, we analyze the possible privacy threats contained in various types of contact tracing apps by applying LINDDUN, which is a threat modeling technique for personal information protection. Third, we make a comparison and analysis of various contact tracing techniques from privacy point of view. These studies can facilitate improve tracing and security performance to contact tracing apps through comparisons between different types.

The system uses an inexpensive (< $0.05) disposable moisture sensor combined with a re-usable temperature sensor and a Bluetooth Low-Energy transceiver module costing less than $15. The battery lifetime using the CR2032 coin cell is greater than 3 years while sampling data at 10s intervals. This sensor data can be used for monitoring, alerting, statistical analysis, and potentially reducing the incidence of infections. The data can be monitored and processed locally or stored on a server to be analyzed remotely. The prototyped devices were tested and shown to detect as little as 10 mL of tap water when poured into the smart brief. The temperature resolution of less than 0.25 degrees F was observed and a wireless range of 20 m indoors and 100 m outdoors was measured.

The research was carried out in the context of a European Union funded project targeting the development of a configurable, cost-effective cyber-physical system for monitoring older adults in their homes. The system comprises a number of hardware nodes deployed as intelligent luminaires that replace light bulbs present in the monitored location. By measuring the strength of a Bluetooth Low Energy signal generated by a device on the monitored person, a rough estimation of the person's location is obtained. We show that the presence of walls, furniture and other objects in typical indoor settings precludes accurate localisation. In order to improve accuracy, we employ several software-based approaches, including Kalman filtering and neural networks. We carry out an initial experiment showing that additional software processing significantly improves localisation accuracy.

BLE technology is mainly used because of the reduction of material and energy cost over time that has huge impact compared to other technology which is more costly. In this research, we propose a new hybrid method to increase the accuracy of indoor positioning system using hybrid of BLE fingerprinting and PDR. Kalman Filter is used as benchmark of this experiment and ANN and SVR are proposed as a new method to combine both measurements. On benchmark, Kalman filter achieve positioning root-mean-squared error 212.21 cm and the proposed SVR 149.12 cm and ANN 111.78 cm. CO 2021 The Authors.

As the fractional spur cannot be suppressed by IL-DPLL, this work proposes a random edge injection (REI) to reduce the spur. This technique also speeds up the convergence time of gain calibration of the digital-to-time converter (DTC). Furthermore, the proposed background calibration schemes allow the DPLL to achieve stable performance across all BLE channels, including both integer-N and fractional-N channels. This work was fabricated in the 40-nm CMOS technology occupying a 0.09-mm(2) area. A fractional spur of -44 dBc and a reference spur of are achieved while consuming 2.76 mW when REI is activated. The background calibrations also ensure stable performance across BLE channels.

To address this issue and enable more flexible and concurrent communications among IoT devices, we propose (BW2)-W-2, a novel communication framework that enables N-way concurrent communication among Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices. Specifically, we demonstrate that it is possible to enable the BLE to Wi-Fi cross-technology communication while supporting the concurrent BLE to BLE and Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi communications. We conducted extensive experiments under different real-world settings, and results show that its throughput is more than 85X times higher than that of the most recently reported cross-technology communication system, which only supports one-way communication (i.e., broadcasting) at any specific time.

Seamless Guidance System Combining GPS, BLE Beacon, and NFC Technologies	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Users rely increasingly on Location-Based Services (LBS) and automated navigation/guidance systems nowadays. However, while such services are easily implemented in outdoor environments using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, a requirement still exists for accurate localization and guidance schemes in indoor settings. Accordingly, the present study proposes a system based on GPS, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Through establishing graphic information and the design of algorithm, this study develops a guidance system for indoors and outdoors on smart phones, wishing to give user perfect smart life through this system. The proposed system is implemented on a smart phone and evaluated on a student campus environment. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed app to switch automatically from an outdoor mode to an indoor mode and to guide the user to requested target destination via the shortest possible route.

Artefacts in sEMG-signals and analysis are caused by the movements of the cables between the sensor and electrode. Hence, there already exist some pre-amplified and wireless sEMG electrodes. These deliver black box devices to end users, for commercial reasons. However, there is a demand for open source devices from a research perspectives. This paper explores the development of an open source wireless sEMG device that distributes the processing of the raw sEMG data between the wireless electrode and the researcher's computing device. In cooperation with CSEM Landquart (CH) the possibility for the use of electrode-printing technology will be evaluated. We show that Bluetooth Low Energy has a high potential as a low power wireless communication protocol in this application, but that further improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is necessary.

In order to explore the potential benefits of a DCT system in the context of occupational risk prevention, this article presents the potential of visual analytics methods to summarize and extract relevant information from complex DCT data collected during a long-term experiment at our research center. Visual tools were combined with quantitative metrics to provide insights into contact patterns among volunteers. Results showed that crucial actors, such as participants acting as bridges between groups could be easily identified-ultimately allowing for making more informed management decisions aimed at containing the potential spread of a disease.

However, monitoring a large enterprise or cloud DCs requires the deployment of thousands of sensors distributively with an operational time over months or years. Low Energy Monitoring Network (LEMoNet) is a two-tier Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based protocol for DC monitoring that leverages multi-gateway packet reception in its top tier to mitigate the unreliable BLE communication in the low tier. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to study the scalability and energy efficiency of LeMoNet in large-scale DCs. The accuracy of the model is validated through extensive event-driven simulations. Evaluation results show that LEMoNet can achieve high reliability in a network of 4800 nodes at a duty cycle of 15 sec (or equivalently, at an aggregated traffic load of 66Kbps per advertisement channel).

This arrangement comes with some drawbacks like considerable power dissipation, high cost, increased complexity of wiring harness and decreased accuracy. Here in this paper we present a qualitative analysis of different "wireless" communication protocols on the basis of parameters like Range, Power Consumption, Performance, Reliability and Simplicity. Implementation of wireless architecture will not only enable a monitoring system that is cheap and accurate but also result in decrease of the overall weight and size of the battery pack. A number of wireless protocols like ZigBee(IEEE 802.15.4), Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE5.0), Near Field Communication, Wi-Fi(IEEE 802.11) and Wi-Fi HaLow(IEEE 802.11ah) are considered as part of study in this paper.

The floor plan is modeled as a combination of links and open space polygons that are connected by nodes. In the authors' earlier work the link transition probabilities in this graph are proportional to the total link lengths that are the total lengths of the subgraphs accessible by choosing the considered link option, and this article extends this model to include open space polygons as well. A particle filter using the extended motion model in which all particles are constrained according to the map structure is presented. Furthermore, wireless local area network and Bluetooth Low Energy positioning tests show that the proposed algorithm outperforms comparison methods especially if the measurement rate is low.

The widespread capture and aggregation of data from sensors and smart devices combined with processing using machine learning in cloud computing platforms provides unrivalled insights into our environment. In addition to the numerous benefits (smart healthcare, cities, transportation, etc.) such insights potentially jeopardise the privacy of individuals, organisations, and society as whole. This is despite UK and EU regulations attempting to mitigate the risk of individuals' data exposure and the impact of it on their security. To demonstrate the exploitation of metadata and its threat to privacy, this paper presents Meta-Blue, a Bluetooth Low Energy metadata capture, analysis, and visualisation tool. The results of a case study are combined with an overview of literature on IoT privacy to provide a holistic overview of the challenges and opportunities presented by IoT metadata.

The scattering is accomplished by modulating an incident continuous wave signal (CW) according to an intermediate signal such that the modulated signal is receivable by a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) receiver. The intermediate signal provides for frequency shifting as well as information carrying modulation and is specifically designed as a signal with a relative low frequency of ca. 4 MHz, which allows for signal generation by a low energy microcontroller. The microcontroller receives its operational energy from a harvesting circuit, which accumulates and intermediately stores the energy of the incident CW signal. We achieved unidirectional BLE advertising by combining scattering technology and energy harvesting and thus showed the feasibility of wireless communication from a battery- less RF scattering transponder to a regular mobile telephone.

For them, the public transport service becomes the most important way to move from one place to another. However, using this type of transport can be difficult and confusing, even for people with normal cognitive and sensory abilities. In this way, this work describes the idea and the operation of a system composed of a mobile application and a server that will allow guiding these people through the means of transport in a simpler way. To do this, among other features, the mobile application makes use of a beacons-based localisation system using Bluetooth Low Energy instance of GPS and integrates a recommendation system based on fuzzy logic, while the server is responsible for calculating the optimal route for the journeys that users want to do.

Many of those technologies are related to the problem of determining the position of an object in space, such as the robot, people, and so on. In this paper, we combine a range-free method, i.e., fingerprinting, and a range-based method, i.e., multi-lateration, to propose a novel indoor positioning system using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). First, we apply multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) on a time series of RSS readings to coarsely estimate the target location. From the knowledge of the coarse location, we select reliable beacons and apply least square-based multi-lateration to their estimated distance to finely estimate the target position. We also proposed a novel weighted least square method based on uncertainty propagation to improve localisation accuracy. Experiments have shown that our proposed system, which is implemented on Raspberry Pi (RPi), is highly precise and deployable.

In order to support the mesh topology in BLE networks, several proposals have been designed. Among them, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) recently released a specification for Bluetooth mesh networks based upon BLE technology. This paper focuses on this standard solution and analyses its security protocol with hardware security in mind. As it is expected that internet of things (IoT) devices will be deployed everywhere, the risk of physical attacks must be assessed. First, we provide a comprehensive survey of the security features involved in Bluetooth mesh. Then, we introduce some physical attacks identified as serious threats for the IoT and discuss their relevance in the case of Bluetooth mesh networks. Finally, we briefly discuss possible countermeasures to reach a secure implementation.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with its low-cost, low power consumption, short delay and high reliability makes smartphone-based PEPS with the potential to replace the existing PEPS. Localization-based Service (LBS) in vehicles requires centimeter-level positioning accuracy and millisecond level response, which becomes a big challenge for localization scheme and algorithm. This paper studies the critical problem of locating and identifying the interior and exterior of vehicle based on BLE received signal strength (RSS). A comparative study on interior and exterior positioning in vehicle is presented in this paper by applying deterministic method, probabilistic method and pattern recognition method based on experiments in vehicle. Experiment results show that fingerprint-based probabilistic method gets higher localization accuracy in vehicular application scenario than other methods.

We adopt a deep neural network image encoder to encode the given input image and generates a compact representation of the image. The representation can be as short as 10 bytes. On the receiver end, we adopt a deep neural network decoder running on a mobile device. When the mobile device receives the BLE broadcasted image data, it decodes the original image. We develop a pair of smartphone applications. One application takes an image and user-requirements as inputs, shows previews of different quality output images, writes the encoded image into a set of beacons. The second application reads the broadcasted image back.

A trace obtained from an actual user movement is considered as being more realistic than using synthetic mobility models in simulators. Though realistic, usually, these traces lack information about the actual wireless contact durations between users. Most simulators use Unit Disk Graph (UDG) model to determine contact durations. However, due to the nature of radio propagations, a simplistic connectivity model (with UDG) may result in simulating unrealistic connectivity patterns. In this work, we have used an Android Smartphone application to collect GPS traces of moving users and their corresponding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) contact times to compare the viability of using UDG to determine contact durations. The results show that trace based model with UDG based wireless connectivity is an effective method to determine contact durations.

Little has been said about the effectiveness of CT. In this paper, we present a real data analysis of a CT experiment that was conducted in Italy for 8 months and involved more than 100,000 CT app users. Objective: We aimed to discuss the technical and health aspects of using a centralized approach. We also aimed to show the correlation between the acquired contact data and the number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Finally, we aimed to analyze CT data to define population behaviors and show the potential applications of real CT data. Methods: We collected, analyzed, and evaluated CT data on the duration, persistence, and frequency of contacts over several months of observation. A statistical test was conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between indices of behavior that were calculated from the data and the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population (new SARS-CoV-2-positive cases). Results: We found evidence of a correlation between a weighted measure of contacts and the number of new SARS-CoV-2-positive cases (Pearson coefficient=0.86), thereby paving the road to better and more accurate data analyses and spread predictions. Conclusions: Our data have been used to determine the most relevant epidemiological parameters and can be used to develop an agent-based system for simulating the effects of restrictions and vaccinations.

At the same time, demand has grown for LBS applications in indoor environments, such as indoor path finding and navigation, marketing, entertainment, and location-based information retrieval. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a smartphone-based indoor LBS system for location services consisting of smartphone applications and a server. The proposed indoor LBS system uses hybrid indoor positioning methods based on Bluetooth beacons, Geomagnetic field, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, and smartphone cameras and can be used for three types of indoor LBS applications. The performance of each positioning method demonstrates that our system retains the desired accuracy under experimental conditions. As these results illustrate that our system can maintain positioning accuracy to within 2 m 80% of the time, we believe our system can be a real solution for various indoor positioning service needs.

Animal monitoring and supervision is one critical aspect in PF, where various types of sensing and control systems are employed. However, available solutions for animal monitoring portrait a compromise between performance and system efficiency in terms of energy consumption, memory allocation, hardware size, and cost. In this work, an energy-efficient, lightweight, and cost effective wireless sensor node for animal monitoring is designed. The designed system is compact and small in size with a dimension of 26 x 33 mm. During its active state, the current consumption of the designed sensor node using ADXL is in the range from 3 to 9 mA at a sampling frequency of 12 Hz.

BLE-GSpeed: A New BLE-Based Dataset to Estimate User Gait Speed	DATA			English	Article; Data Paper						gait speed; public database; BLE-based technology	DISABILITY	To estimate the user gait speed can be crucial in many topics, such as health care systems, since the presence of difficulties in walking is a core indicator of health and function in aging and disease. Methods for non-invasive and continuous assessment of the gait speed may be key to enable early detection of cognitive diseases such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Wearable technologies can provide innovative solutions for healthcare problems. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is excellent for wearables because it is very energy efficient, secure, and inexpensive. In this paper, the BLE-GSpeed database is presented. The dataset is composed of several BLE RSSI measurements obtained while users were walking at a constant speed along a corridor. Moreover, a set of experiments using a baseline algorithm to estimate the gait speed are also presented to provide baseline results to the research community.

Since most IoT devices are mobile, the hardware resources are hard limited; thus, complexity reduction becomes a relevant concern in this context. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication standard has an important position in IoT due to its Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) modulation scheme employed in the physical layer, which provides both attractive spectral and power efficiency. Typically, GFSK requires a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE) implemented through the Viterbi algorithm (VA) at the receiver. This article provides a GFSK receiver based on a new paradigm that transforms the I-Q baseband signal and uses the VA with a reduced-complexity proposed metrics. Comparisons of theoretical and simulated results are presented, and they show that the proposed metrics for the GFSK receiver are compliant with the Bluetooth standard. Henceforth, the proposed receiver is an attractive scheme for IoT BLE devices.

EnerCage-HC2 is equipped with multi-coil wireless power transmission (WPT), closed-loop power control, bidirectional data communication via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Microsoft Kinect (R) based animal behavior tracking and analysis. The EnerCage-HC2 achieves a homogeneous power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 14% on average, with similar to 42 mW power delivered to the load (PDL) at a nominal height of 7 cm by the closed-loop power control mechanism. The Microsoft Kinect (R) behavioral analysis algorithm can not only track the animal position in real-time but also classify 5 different types of rodent behaviors: standstill, walking, grooming, rearing, and rotating. A proof-of-concept in vivo experiment was conducted on two awake freely behaving rats while successfully operating a one-channel stimulator and generating an ethogram.

One particular prototype has a multi-layer design since it is miniaturized by using an Electromagnetic Bandgap substrate operating in its slow-wave region. To design the patch antenna and EBG structure the dielectric properties of a fleece substrate is measured by utilizing ring resonator characterization method. Subsequently, the in-house fabricated textile patch antennas are employed in a wireless Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system for identification and monitoring human vital signs. Using TI's Bluetooth transceiver dongle with a personal laptop computer, and TI CC2540EM and SmartRF05EB boards as a transceiver tag, a communication distance of 17.69m was measured for a mere tag identification. This range is twice of what was obtained with a commercial dipole-type wire antenna. As well, when a vital sign sensor is added to BLE system with textile microstrip patch antenna successful remote measurement of human pulse rate was observed.

The enzyme (uricase)-modified screen printed electrode system has been integrated onto a mouthguard platform along with anatomically-miniaturized instrumentation electronics featuring a potentiostat, microcontroller, and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver. Unlike REID-based biosensing systems, which require large proximal power sources, the developed platform enables real-time wireless transmission of the sensed information to standard smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics for on-demand processing, diagnostics, or storage. The mouthguard biosensor system offers high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability towards uric acid detection in human saliva, covering the concentration ranges for both healthy people and hyperuricemia patients. The new wireless mouthguard biosensor system is able to monitor SUA level in real-time and continuous fashion, and can be readily expanded to an array of sensors for different analytes to enable an attractive wearable monitoring system for diverse health and fitness applications.

Screen-printed and inkjet-printed conductive fabric antennas have been investigated in this manuscript. The former showed optimal radiation performance after fabrication and measurement, which was the basis for developing a new fabric antenna feeding technique. The aperture-fed technique is achieved with a single coaxial cable overlayed on a cut-out slot on the ground layer of the patch antenna. The cable is connected with conductive silver-based epoxy paste with high resilience to mechanical stress. Two antenna models for Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and long-range (LoRa) wireless applications were designed, fabricated, and measured at 2.44 GHz and 868 MHz, respectively, with good impedance and radiation performance. The measured antennas operated from 2.4 to 2.48 GHz (BLE) and 853 to 886 MHz (LoRa) at -10 dB S11. Measured results also showed a 56% radiation efficiency at BLE and 44.9% at LoRa.

However, this evolution is not proceeding without challenges. Current mobile device GPS systems are not accurate enough to provide the granularity required; especially indoors when there is no line-of-sight with satellites. One promising solution involves using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. In this paper, we present an indoor location system that uses BLE beacons and iPhones. We present the relevant background of work in this area, the architectural framework that we designed and developed, the mobile apps, the machine learning algorithms employed and report on the findings of two fingerprinting methods using three machine learning algorithms. Our indoor micro-location prediction system using beacons consistently performs at an accuracy of at least 1.7 m spherical radius from the target with convergence in under 2 s and was validated on 2,000 trials.

Low cost and energy efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based localization solutions are ideal for extensive use in IoT applications. The main challenge is to combat the signal fluctuation in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Most Machine Learning (ML) algorithms available in the literature to address this issue belong to classification and batch learning. This article proposes a novel online learning algorithm for BLE localization based on Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GBRBM) plus Liquid State Machine (LSM), which learns the training data one-by-one. Unsupervised GBRBM is able to extract sound patterns of fluctuated RSS inputs, and LSM manages to map the patterns to real-time position estimation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art batch learning methods in terms of localization accuracy and complexity.

In recent years, tangible progress in protecting and saving the lives of female victims of intimate partner/family-related homicide has not been made, so targeted responses are clearly needed. In this work, an electronic device to help victims of gender-based violence who live with their aggressor has been designed. The system is built on Bluetooth Low Energy technology allowing a wireless communication between device and mobile phone with a low power consumption. The device is controlled by three different commands and is capable of sending messages through a mobile phone to a Control Center. Depending on the nature of the received messages, the Control Center will take the appropriate measures to assist the victim. The design has been made paying special attention to a reduced size so that the device can easily be camouflaged in any accessory of the victim's jewelry, thus going unperceived to the possible aggressor.

Among these uses are longitudinal studies that have studied social networks, health behaviors, productivity, and other topics with large participant bases and detailed data. In this paper we demonstrate another way to study social behavior during one of these longitudinal studies, the NetHealth study, by predicting whether a pair of students are friends or not through visit data patterns of a social hub of any college campus - the dining hall. We use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons deployed throughout the dining hall to detect when students enter and leave, and create features from this visit data that can cope with varying amounts of data among study participants. We then demonstrate the predictive power of these features, calculated over a semester of data, against ground truth friendship labels given by the participants themselves, obtaining an AUROC of 0.716.

Wearables including embedded data analysis are a suitable tool for online monitoring of movement parameters and might enhance the quality of training significantly. However, due to limited compute capacities for complex data processing on the sensor device itself, analysis can typically only be done afterwards using high-performance tools. This lack of immediate feedback may lead to slower training progress. We present a flexible, wearable system for the analysis of different sports movement including online-monitoring. It includes a modular, platform-based framework with a sensor node, an embedded software stack, Bluetooth Low Energy communication and an Android application. Data is analyzed on the sensor itself via embedded real-time algorithms. Results indicate that the device provides reliable and accurate measurements of movement parameters. In combination with adaptable algorithms and the BLE transmission, it offers solutions for real-time monitoring of athletic performance.

With proper input matching, this structure is shown to provide a reasonable power gain and superior linearity and efficiency in comparison to other low-power topologies. This is shown to be due to the low dependency of the power gain to the transistor transconductance and the low-voltage variations across the gate-source capacitance. This power amplifier is suitable for low-power and short-range applications such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Based on the calculated S-parameters, the operation frequency of this amplifier and its design trade-offs are presented, along with a comparison with competitive topologies. The design is simulated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology, operates with a 1.2 V supply, and provides a power gain of 8.5 dB with a DC power consumption of 3.6 mW. The input 1-dB compression point is 2.2 dBm, yielding a power added efficiency of 43%.

Many other SE systems to date support remote control and automation but not access control, making them applicable to homes but not offices or other public settings. Even if they implement access control, virtually all existing SE systems suffer from central point of failure. To address these problems, we propose a new SE system that supports not only access control but also distributed access from multiple devices without relying on centralized control. In addition to access-control list, we also take advantage of the proximity tag feature supported by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol without requiring users to take out their identifying BLE devices from their pockets as one would have to do with RFID tags. Experimental results show that our SE system to offer the security features required for public deployment with minimal power, latency, and cost overhead.

However, they usually suffer from poor proximity detection accuracy due to the reliance on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) that is prone to drastic fluctuations in the indoor environment due to interference and reflections. To mitigate these effects, a realistic Indoor Positioning System, based on typical BLE beacons and mobile devices that improves accuracy through a low-cost, one-time offline calibration process, is proposed and implemented. Indoor positioning techniques are enhanced by combining the filtering of both RSSI values and estimated positions while using complementary technologies such as QR and NFC to recalibrate the system with exact starting positions. Comprehensive experimental studies on a real indoor environment with different system settings are conducted. The results demonstrate that the implemented approach achieves a meter accuracy in 87.2% of the estimated position values for the specified scenario.

Measurements were fed to the open-source TensorFlow framework to develop an estimator of the distance between the mobile phone and the beacon. Next, based on the cross-sections of peripheral lines having as a center the location of the Beacons and radius the predicted distances we compute the intersection points from all circles and base our position estimation on the Geometric median of intersection points.

Here, we propose an innovative data sharing scheme called as the Parasitic Location Logging (PLL). PLL can acquire location of such users, what we call parasitic users, without invoking any location functionalities by the GPS and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors of their smartphones. PLL estimates parasitic users' location and trajectory by relying on other users who pass by the parasitic user, what we call host users, as evidence that they are located in close proximity. The results of field experiments showed that PLL dramatically decreases battery consumption of parasitic users' smartphones and that the position of parasitic users can be identified accurately. Moreover, the battery consumption of PLL was rigorously evaluated in a laboratory setting to demonstrate its benefit. An agent simulation evaluating the proposed calculation algorithm under various conditions in realistic environments validated the robustness of PLL.

A novel Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Beacon system was deployed on a subset of those CO measurement periods to estimate participants' distances to their most-used cooking areas during the sampling periods. In addition to presenting methods and validation for the BLE Beacon system, here we present pollution exposure assessment modeling results using two different approaches, in which time-activity (proximity) data is used to: (1) better understand exposure and behaviors within and away from homes; and (2) predict personal exposure via microenvironment air quality measurements. Model fits were improved in both cases, demonstrating the benefits of the proximity measurements.

We present here a miniature, low power, 2 channel wireless neural recording system with sampling rates of 20ksps to allow researchers to understand the neurological functioning to develop therapies in freely moving small animals. The wireless implant uses Carbon Nano Tube Yarn (CNTY) electrodes to interface with the nervous system and record signals. High data transmission rates are achieved by using an Ultra-wideband Impulse Radio (UWB-IR) transmitter and wireless switching control is provided by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The UWB transmitter is primarily designed to make it chronically implantable in freely moving rats to record neural activity but is also applicable to the telemetry of any signals such as surface EEG. Preliminary experiments and bench test results have confirmed its functioning for a distance range of more than 5m with high data transmission rate and low power consumption.

These applications often require the sensor positioning to link the measurements with its location. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies on BLE transmitter positioning methods. Power fingerprinting transmitter positioning approaches are commonly used in BLE network. However, these methods have their own limitations in terms of practical use and ease of implementation. The purpose is to develop a simple BLE transmitter positioning of high accuracy. In this paper, a BLE transmitter positioning method is proposed based on Angle of Arrival (AOA) estimation. Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is used for angle estimation due to the high angular resolution and sensitivity. Several experiments have been conducted in an indoor environment and the results compared with simulation results. Experimental results show that our proposed BLE transmitter positioning method achieves a promising positioning accuracy.

The RSSI-based positioning is roughly classified into two types: user navigation and monitoring. Our target is the user monitoring scenario by using commercially available BLE dongles, which are compact, inexpensive, and low power consumptions. In this case, the user device sends beacon signals to a large number of receivers in the room. Due to the insufficient BLE transceiver for the accurate positioning, sophisticated support vector machine (SVM)-aided machine learning algorithm plays a vital role in dealing with impairments induced by BLE. Furthermore, according to contiguous movements of the object, prior information of the positioning can be yielded for improving the object tracking capability. Finally, Kalman filter is applied to smooth the tracking results. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

In order to work in complete unknown indoor environments, the robot needs to map its surroundings. This is done via the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. However, the SLAM algorithm does not provide additional context to the generated map. If this information is required, it needs to be provided by the operator. With Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, position dependent information can be annotated to the generated map without operator input. BLE beacons need to be positioned at points of interest for the robot and then need to be localized. Because the BLE beacon broadcasts an ID, localization is based on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). This paper presents an approach to localize BLE beacons in the RADIO indoor environment. The robot has one BLE receiver which must be used cleverly in order to triangulate the BLE beacons position.

The transconductor employs local negative feedback for linearization controlling the drain voltage of the input transistors biased in the triode region. The gain boosted feedback amplifier is based on quasi-floating gate MOS transistors and its adjustable biasing current allows tuning the cutoff frequency of the filter. The filter is intended to be used in the baseband section of a zero-IF bluetooth low energy receiver and it has been fabricated in a standard 0.13-mu m CMOS technology with a nominal cutoff frequency of 500 kHz. The power consumption of the overall filter is 450 mu W with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The measurement results show a third-order intermodulation distortion of -46.4 dB for two input tones located at the passband of the filter. The filter occupies a silicon area of 0.08 mm(2).

However, these technologies can be used to lend their highly accurate localisation capabilities to low-cost, commodity, and less-accurate technologies. In this paper, we bridge this link by proposing a technology-agnostic calibration framework based on artificial intelligence to assist such low-cost technologies through highly accurate localisation systems. A single-layer neural network is used to calibrate a less accurate technology using a more accurate one such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and UWB using a professional motion tracking system. On a real indoor testbed, we demonstrate an improvement in accuracy of approximately 70% for BLE and 50% for UWB. Not only does the proposed approach require a very short measurement campaign, the low complexity of a single-layer neural network makes it ideal for deployment on constrained devices typically used for localisation purposes.

In this paper we present iConfig, an edge-driven platform dedicated to manage IoT devices in smart cities. The goal is to address three major issues in current IoT management: registration, configuration, and maintenance. The core of iConfig is its programmable edge module, which can be deployed across smartphones, wearables, and smart boards to configure and interact with physically proximate IoT devices. Through testbed experiments and usability studies, we reveal the hardship and hidden pitfalls in managing IoT devices, especially for low budget devices like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Our system evaluation shows that iConfig can effectively address the aforementioned IoT management challenges by harnessing the mobile and edge cooperation. To inspire community contributions, we further present concrete use cases to illustrate how iConfig can reduce operational cost and facilitate future edge-centric IoT research.

The basic requirements of the indoor positioning system are high accuracy, availability, and cost and energy efficiency. Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based iBeacon along with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system meets the aforementioned requirements. For iBeacon based indoor positioning, path-loss model is adopted to calculate the distance between user and iBeacon, and the maximum likelihood estimate positioning method is proposed for positioning. In the PDR positioning system, the Mahony Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) is adopted to calculate the attitude of smart phone, in order to improve the performance of heading inference. Because of the presence of error accumulation over time in PDR based positioning system, along with the fact that the iBeacon based positioning system is susceptible to disturbance, we proposed an integration algorithm for iBeacon and PDR using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Experiments indicates that the proposed method can achieve a meter-level precision.

J	Naghdi, S; O'Keefe, K				Naghdi, Sharareh; O'Keefe, Kyle			Combining Multichannel RSSI and Vision with Artificial Neural Networks to Improve BLE Trilateration	SENSORS			English	Article						advertising channels; BLE; trilateration; artificial intelligence; localization; human body shadowing	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; LOCALIZATION	The demands for accurate positioning and navigation applications in complex indoor environments such as emergency call positioning, fire-fighting services, and rescue operations are increasing continuously. Indoor positioning approaches apply different types of sensors to increase the accuracy of the user's position. Among these technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) appeared as a popular alternative due to its low cost and energy efficiency. However, BLE faces challenges related to Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fluctuations caused by human body shadowing. This work presents a method to compensate RSSI values by applying Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms to RSSI measurements from three BLE advertising channels and a wearable camera as an additional source of information for the presence or absence of human obstacles. The resulting improved RSSI values are then converted into ranges using path loss models, and trilateration is applied to obtain indoor localization. The proposed artificial system provides significantly better localization solutions than fingerprinting or trilateration using uncorrected RSSI values.

This paper presents a system that continuously monitors the proper pencil grip and writing activity of kid using accelerometer and pressure sensors. The system creates a labeled dataset for recognizing the correct location of pencil grip, holding direction of the pencil, and writing activity of kids. The system uses a supervised machine learning technique and labeled dataset for classifying whether a kid properly uses a pencil or not. In addition, a prototype system is developed and adequately tested on real-time user data. The prototype uses accelerometer and pressure sensors for extracting the writing activities. The system uses bluetooth low energy for wirelessly transferring the sensed data of writing activities to the parent and teachers. The system is suitable for kids due to its low cost, small size, and low-power consumption.

There are different conventional methods for capturing respiration signal, such as polysomnography and spirometer. In spite of their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based respiration monitoring platform which allows the patient to continue treatment and diagnosis from different places such as home. These remote services are designed for patients who suffer from breathing problems or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. Based on the high correlation between spirometer and accelerometer signals, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has been applied on respiration signals. The obtained results show that DFA can be used as an efficient feature while classifying the healthy people from patients suffering from breath abnormalities.

The protocol is designed to be lightweight, broadcasting limited-time tokens over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, allowing receivers to record contacts pseudonymously. However, currently proposed protocols have vulnerabilities that permit an adversary to perform massive surveillance or cause significant numbers of false-positive alerts. In this paper, we present AcousticMask, which encrypts broadcast messages using a key derived from the audio signal present at each device with sufficient security levels. Our results show that a receiver sharing the same social space as a sender will hear all of the sender's ephemeral IDs (EphIDs) with Hamming distance at most 3, which can be decrypted at the rate of 10 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4, while achieving a security factor of over 2108 against attackers in our testing set, showing AcousticMask is lightweight for DCT and provides sufficient security levels to protect user's privacy.

Examples of such applications include commercial advertisements, social networking software and patient monitoring. The received signal strength (RSS) based location fingerprinting is one of the most popular solutions for indoor localization. However, there is a big challenge in collecting and maintaining a relatively large RSS fingerprint database. In this work, we propose and compare two algorithms namely, the Gaussian process (GP) and Gaussian process with variogram, to estimate and construct the RSS fingerprints with incomplete data. The fingerprint of unknown reference points is estimated based on measurements at a limited number of surrounding locations. To validate the effectiveness of both algorithms, experiments using Bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) infrastructure have been conducted. The constructed RSS fingerprints are compared to the true measurements, and the result is analyzed. Finally, using the constructed fingerprints, the localization performance of a probabilistic fingerprinting method is evaluated.

While standards are starting to incorporate coexistence measurements, the robustness of coexistence measurement methods is still an area of active research. To demonstrate the robustness of the multiple test methods, a series of measurements needs to be conducted that compare a measurement methods. Ideally, if the same coexistence test is performed by use of each of the four methods, the end result should be the same. Here, we compare two popular radiated test methods: an anechoic chamber test and a radiated open-environment test. Both methods are part of the ANSI C63.27 standard. We examine the impact two of the possible environments may have on the outcome of a coexistence test. For this, we use Bluetooth low energy and Wi-Fi networks. Overviews of generalized coexistence testing and future work are also presented.

Although mostly uncomplicated and easily treatable, if identified early, UTI can be a major source of morbidity and mortality in geriatric patients, in particular, those suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and in infants who have difficulties in communicating symptoms, making early identification of UTIs crucial. In this paper, we present a diaper-embedded, wireless, self-powered, and autonomous UTI monitoring sensor module that allows an effortless early detection of UTIs. The sensor module consists of a paper-based colorimetric nitrite sensor, urine-powered batteries, a boost converter, a low-power sensor interface utilizing pulse width modulation (PWM), and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module for wireless transmission. Experimental results show a better detection of nitrite, a surrogate of UTI, than conventional dipstick testing. The sensor module achieves a sensitivity of 1.35 ms/(mg/L)and a detection limit of 4 mg/ L for nitrite.

The network node integrates sensors for ambient monitoring, e.g. the recording of temperature, 3D acceleration and ambient light measurement. Recorded data can be sent via BLE to any remote device which supports BLE, e.g. a smartphone. In this paper, a heart rate sensor is implemented to demonstrate heart rate signal processing and its applications in sports. The on-board signal processing is performed on the MSP430 low-power microcontroller. As an example application, the data is wirelessly sent to a smartphone running Android OS for visualization. This paper describes the software and hardware development of the heart rate monitoring system including the signal pre-processing. The developed PCB has been integrated into a chest harness with integrated textile electrodes for heart rate measurement.

A 16-channel analog-front-end (AFE) featuring a chopper low noise amplifier (LNA) and a 12-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) is designed as the sensor interface. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based in-the-air protocol is implemented for wireless data transmission. A precise synchronization method is proposed featuring a millisecond level synchronization accuracy between the video frames and the acquired bio-potential. The compact wireless bio-potential recorder features a size of 2 x 2.5 x 1cm and a battery life of 9 hours. In-vivo test has been performed on rats with long-term implantable electrodes. The proposed system successfully recorded the electroneurogram (ENG) signal from sciatic nerves and electromyography (EMG) signal from leg muscles. Also video-based gait analysis was performed and provided the labels to train an EMG-based gait phase classifier.
