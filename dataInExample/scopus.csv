In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Edge/Fog computing; Healthcare; Home care; Internet of Things; Mobility; Sensor network; Smart gateway; Smart hospital","Automation; Carrier mobility; Computer circuits; Cyber Physical System; Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Fog; Health; Health care; Home networks; Hospitals; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Interoperability; Monitoring; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Edge/Fog computing; Health monitoring system; Home care; Internet of Things (IOT); Smart hospital; Ubiquitous health monitoring; Ubiquitous healthcare system; Gateways (computer networks)","Rahmani, A.M.; Department of Computer Science, University of California IrvineUnited States; email: amirr1@uci.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012875280

Smart Metering systems is such an IoT-enabled technology that enables convenient and high frequency data collection compared to existing metering systems. However, such a frequent data collection puts the consumers’ privacy in risk as it helps expose the consumers’ daily habits. Secure in-network data aggregation can be used to both preserve consumers’ privacy and reduce the packet traffic due to high frequency metering data. The privacy can be provided by performing the aggregation on concealed metering data. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and secure multiparty computation (secure MPC) are the systems that enable performing multiple operations on concealed data. However, both FHE and secure MPC systems have some overhead in terms of data size or message complexity. The overhead is compounded in the IoT-enabled networks such as Smart Grid (SG) Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). In this paper, we propose new protocols to adapt FHE and secure MPC to be deployed in SG AMI networks that are formed using wireless mesh networks. The proposed protocols conceal the smart meters’ (SMs) reading data by encrypting it (FHE) or computing its shares on a randomly generated polynomial (secure MPC). The encrypted data/computed shares are aggregated at some certain aggregator SM(s) up to the gateway of the network in a hierarchical manner without revealing the readings’ actual value. To assess their performance, we conducted extensive experiments using the ns-3 network simulator. The simulation results indicate that the secure MPC-based protocol can be a viable privacy-preserving data aggregation mechanism since it not only reduces the overhead with respect to FHE but also almost matches the performance of the Paillier cryptosystem when it is used within a proper sized AMI network. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fully homomorphic encryption; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving protocols; Reliable data aggregation; Secure multiparty computation; Smart Metering systems","Advanced metering infrastructures; Cryptography; Data acquisition; Data privacy; Electric measuring instruments; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Internet protocols; MESH networking; Fully homomorphic encryption; Privacy-preserving protocols; Reliable data aggregation; Secure multi-party computation; Smart metering; Network security","Tonyali, S.; The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International UniversityUnited States; email: stonyali@fiu.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018181196

In this paper, we propose a reliable oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Devices. In order to use a Personal Healthcare Device as an Application Dedicated Node in the proposed system, a protocol conversion between ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol messages and oneM2M protocol messages is performed in gateways located between Personal Healthcare Devices and the PHD management server. The proposed oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Device is constructed, and evaluated in various experiments. The experiments show that the protocol conversion performs effectively, and that the conversion process does not cause the system to suffer serious performance degradation, even when the number of Application Dedicated Node is quite large. Some Personal Healthcare Device data is too precious to lose due to system failures under u-healthcare environments. However, until now, few studies have focused on fault-tolerant health data services. Therefore, we also propose a fault-tolerant algorithm for the reliable IoT system in which gateways on the same layer in the system are linked to form a daisy chain for fault tolerance at the level, and a gateway stores the backup copy of the previous gateway positioned immediately ahead of the gateway in the daisy chain. The upper-layered gateway stores the parity data of the daisy chain as well. In this manner, as many as two gateway faults occurred at the same time can be recovered. For experiments, the resource trees of the oneM2M-based IoT system were expanded to store information on daisy chains, backup copies, and parity. Our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can recover from faults on gateways in the oneM2M-based IoT system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Daisy chain; Fault-tolerant; IoT; OneM2M; Personal Healthcare Device; u-healthcare","Chains; Fault tolerance; Gateways (computer networks); Health care; Remote patient monitoring; Systems engineering; Fault tolerant algorithms; Fault-tolerant; Health care application; OneM2M; Performance degradation; Personal health care; Protocol conversion; u-Healthcare; Internet of things","Park, K.; Computer Engineering Department, Keimyung University, 1000 Sindang-dong, Dalseo-gu, South Korea; email: khp@kmu.ac.kr",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017546428

Even though some of these applications can be of industrial relevance, their immediate application to real products is not straightforward since most of them require a complete and expensive hardware redesign of the considered embedded solution. To speed up the technological transfer of custom embedded solutions while overtaking the limits imposed by a complete hardware redesign, the article presents AMBER, an innovative embedded platform leveraging on a design based on System-on-Modules (SOM) and Extender modules. AMBER decouples the processing part of the system, which is fully contained on the SOM, from the peripherals, which are contained on the main board and Extender modules. This allows a smooth industrial-oriented redesign of the embedded solution. In the article, AMBER is first presented starting from its philosophy and design choices while highlighting its main features. Then, an application of AMBER as an enhanced gateway to be used in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario is reported by considering a monitoring and actuation use case. The IIoT-oriented AMBER solution is hardware and software configured to support real-time communications with actuators compliant with the Powerlink standard, as well as to interact with sensors compliant with Bluetooth Low Energy.

It utilizes digital sensors and cloud computing to present a quality healthcare service outside of the classical hospital environment. This resulted in the emergence of a new class of online web 4.0 services, which are termed “cloud healthcare services”. Cloud healthcare services offer a straightforward opportunity for patients to communicate with healthcare professionals and utilize their personal IoHT devices to obtain timely and accurate medical guidance and decisions. The personal IoHT devices integrate sensed health data at a central cloud healthcare service to extract useful health insights for wellness and preventive care strategies. However, the present practices for cloud healthcare services rely on a centralized approach, where patients’ health data are collected and stored on servers, located at remote locations, which might be functioning under data privacy laws somewhat different from the ones applied where the service is running. Promoting a privacy respecting cloud services encourages patients to actively participate in these healthcare services and to routinely provide an accurate and precious health data about themselves. With the emergence of fog computing paradigm, privacy protection can now be enforced at the edge of the patient’s network regardless of the location of service providers. In this paper, a framework for cloud healthcare recommender service is presented. We depicted the personal gateways at the patients’ side act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between IoHT devices and cloud healthcare services. A fog-based middleware will be hosted on these fog nodes for an efficient aggregation of patients generated health data while maintaining the privacy and the confidentiality of their health profiles. The proposed middleware executes a two-stage concealment process that utilizes the hierarchical nature of IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. At that, the patients will be empowered with a tool to control the privacy of their health data by enabling them to release their health data in a concealed form. The further processing at the cloud healthcare service continues over the concealed data by applying the proposed protocols. The proposed solution was integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the patients’ health data when utilized by a cloud healthcare recommender service to generate health insights. Our approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both patients and service providers. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cloud healthcare services; Internet of healthcare things; Recommender services; Secure multiparty computation","Data privacy; Distributed database systems; Fog; Health; Health care; Internet of things; Internet service providers; Middleware; Centralized approaches; Computing environments; Health care professionals; Healthcare services; Hospital environment; Privacy protection; Recommender services; Secure multi-party computation; Web services","Rho, S.; Department of Media Software, Sungkyul UniversitySouth Korea; email: smrho@sungkyul.ac.kr",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033483262

These services can be accessed through smart gadgets by the user at any place, every time and anywhere. This makes security and privacy central to IoT environments. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust, and multi-factor remote user authentication and key agreement scheme for IoT environments. Using this protocol, any authorized user can access and gather real-time sensor data from the IoT nodes. Before gaining access to any IoT node, the user must first get authenticated by the gateway node as well as the IoT node. The proposed protocol is based on XOR and hash operations, and includes: (i) a 3-factor authentication (ie, password, biometrics, and smart device); (ii) mutual authentication; (iii) shared session key; and (iv) key freshness. It satisfies desirable security attributes and maintains acceptable efficiency in terms of the computational overheads for resource constrained IoT environment. Further, the informal and formal security analysis using AVISPA proves security strength of the protocol and its robustness against all possible security threats. Simulation results also prove that the scheme is secure against attacks.

Portable handheld user devices contribute significantly to the scalability of OppNets since their number increases according to user population and they closely follow human movement patterns. Hence, OppNets for sensed data collection are characterised by high node population and degrees of spatial locality inherent to user movement. We study the impact of these characteristics on the performance of existing OppNet message replication techniques. Our findings reveal that the existing replication techniques are not specifically designed to cope with these characteristics. This raises concerns regarding excessive message transmission overhead and throughput degradations due to resource constraints and technological limitations associated with portable handheld user devices. Based on concepts derived from the study, we suggest design guidelines to augment existing message replication techniques. We also follow our design guidelines to propose a message replication technique, namely Locality Aware Replication (LARep). Simulation results show that LARep achieves better network performance under high node population and degrees of spatial locality as compared with existing techniques. © 2017 by the authors.","Delay tolerant data; Internet of Things; Opportunistic networks; Routing; Sensed data collection; Smart city; Smartphones; Wireless sensors","Data acquisition; Design; Internet of things; Population statistics; Smart city; Smartphones; Wireless ad hoc networks; Data collection; Delay tolerant; Opportunistic networks; Routing; Wireless sensor; Delay tolerant networks","Amah, T.E.; Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: teamah2@live.utm.my",,"MDPI AG",20782489,,,,"English","Information",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033690489

Energy management, for example has attracted huge interest from academia, industries, governments and regulatory bodies. It involves collecting energy usage data, analyzing it, and optimizing the energy consumption by applying control strategies. However, in industrial environments, performing such optimization is not trivial. The changes in business rules, process control, and customer requirements make it much more challenging. In this paper, a Semantic Rules Engine (SRE) for industrial gateways is presented that allows implementing dynamic and flexible rule-based control strategies. It is simple, expressive, and allows managing rules on-the-fly without causing any service interruption. Additionally, it can handle semantic queries and provide results by inferring additional knowledge from previously defined concepts in ontologies. SRE has been validated and tested on different hardware platforms and in commercial products. Performance evaluations are also presented to validate its conformance to the customer requirements.

In general, a number of authentication and authorization schemes are available to prevent and protect the sensitive data, which are collected with the help of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The transport layer security (TLS) protocol is designed to transfer the data from source to destination in more reliable manner. This protocol enables a user to overcome the no lost or reordered messages. The more challenge with TLS is to tolerate unreliability. In order to overcome this issue, Datagram transport layer security (DTLS) protocol has been designed and used in low-power wireless constrained networks. The DTLS protocol consists of a base protocol, record layer, handshake protocol, ChangeCipherSpec and alert protocol. The complex issue with the DTLS protocol is the possibility of an attacker could send a number of ClientHello messages to a server. This scenario would cause a denial-of-service (DOS) attack against the server. This DoS attack enables new connection between the attacker and server, increasing attacker bandwidth, and allocation of resources for every ClientHello message. In order to overcome this issue, we have proposed a smart gateway-based authentication and authorization method to prevent and protect more sensitive physiological data from an attacker and malicious users. The enhanced smart gateway-based DTLS is demonstrated with the help of Contiki Network Simulator. The packet loss ratio is calculated for the CoAP, host identity protocol, CoAP-DTLS and CoAP-enhanced DTLS to evaluate the performance of the proposed work. Data transmission and handshake time are also calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the enhanced DTLS. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Constrained application protocol (CoAP); Datagram transport layer security (DTLS); Denial of service (DOS); Healthcare; Internet of Things; Security","Authentication; Denial-of-service attack; Health care; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; Network security; Authentication and authorization; Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); Denial of Service; Health care application; Internet of Things (IOT); Security; Transport layer security; Transport layer security protocols; Gateways (computer networks)","Kumar, P.M.; School of Information Technology and Engineering, VIT UniversityIndia; email: priyanit085@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",09208542,,JOSUE,,"English","J Supercomput",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032708828

Previous work has raised questions in terms of the scalability and capacity of LoRaWAN networks as the number of end devices grows to hundreds or thousands per gateway. Some works have modeled LoRaWAN networks as pure ALOHA networks, which fails to capture important characteristics such as the capture effect and the effects of interference. Other works provide a more comprehensive model by relying on empirical and stochastic techniques. This work uses a different approach where a LoRa error model is constructed from extensive complex baseband bit error rate simulations and used as an interference model. The error model is combined with the LoRaWAN MAC protocol in an ns-3 module that enables to study multi channel, multi spreading factor, multi gateway, bi-directional LoRaWAN networks with thousands of end devices. Using the lorawan ns-3 module, a scalability analysis of LoRaWAN shows the detrimental impact downstream traffic has on the delivery ratio of confirmed upstream traffic. The analysis shows that increasing gateway density can ameliorate but not eliminate this effect, as stringent duty cycle requirements for gateways continue to limit downstream opportunities.

In this work, we present an Edge-centric distributed architecture to provide resource discovery and access services to IoT applications. The proposed approach leverages the CoRE Resource Directory interface and the CoAP protocol to expose a standard interface for global discovery and access. Multiple IoT gateways are federated through a P2P overlay implemented by a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which is exploited to share the information on IoT resources available across multiple domains. The proposed solution is validated by means of a small-scale prototype, and extensively evaluated through emulation in large scale deployment in comparison to a centralized Cloud-based approach. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach guarantees lower latencies than a centralized solution and can ensure scalability for small to medium sized deployments.

The capabilities of digital signal processing enable new applications like low power wide area networks (LPWAN), which are expected to play a decisive role in the upcoming Internet of Things. Centralized gateways, usually realized in an SDR architecture, are used to connect many thousands of objects to the internet. Due to the high variance of the received signal level, a high dynamic range is required for the SDR receiver front-end. In current receiver architectures, the dynamic range is mainly limited by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Several techniques have been proposed to extend the dynamic range by stacking multiple ADCs and driving them with different gain factors. Correlation of quantization noise was identified as key parameter to determine the dynamic range enhancement. This paper compares the proposed techniques and extends existing analysis tools for the use of arbitrary gain factors. Additionally, the influence of further noise sources like thermal noise and jitter are taken into account. The theoretical considerations are supported by simulations and measurements using a real LPWAN SDR implementation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Analog-to-digital conversion; Diversity; Dynamic range; Internet of Things; Low power wide area network; Software-defined radio","Analog circuits; Analog to digital conversion; Digital radio; Digital signal processing; Digital to analog conversion; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Radio; Radio receivers; Signal processing; Signal receivers; Wide area networks; Analog to digital converters; Diversity; Dynamic range; Dynamic range enhancement; Low Power; Simulations and measurements; Software defined radio technologies; Software-defined radios; Software radio","Ulbricht, G.; Fraunhofer-Institute für Integrierte Schaltungen, Am Wolfsmantel 33, Germany; email: gerald.ulbricht@iis.fraunhofer.de",,"Springer New York LLC",19398018,,,,"English","J.

However, the data in each specific sensor network is heterogeneous with specific formats and semantics. Thus, it is a huge conundrum to integrate, share and interoperate these sub sensor networks. To solve the above problem, a real-time novel Distributed Cooperative model for Isomerism Multi-Sensor network (DCIMS), is proposed in this paper. The DCIMS architecture is based on distributed cooperative data caching and forwarding, which can handle massive, semantic and real-time data stream at each Sensor Gateway node. A new filtering algorithm named Post-Tree-Automata filter (PTAfilter) is proposed based on unranked tree automata and suffix technologies. The proposed filter can process real-time XML streaming (which contains uncertain semantic elements), and understand more complex subscription structures. Both simulation results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method improves the query speed, reduces redundant transmission intermediate states. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Caching and forwarding; Distributed cooperative computing; Isomerism networks; Multi-sensor networks","Automata theory; Forestry; Gateways (computer networks); Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Isomers; Semantics; Sensor networks; Stereochemistry; Trees (mathematics); Caching and forwarding; Cooperative computing; Cooperative model; Cooperative processing; Filtering algorithm; Intermediate state; Multi-sensor networks; Real-time data streams; Distributed computer systems",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450353526,,,"English","ACM Int.

In order for this increase to occur, a network architecture which is flexible and capable of handling multiple flows with varying requirements as well as dynamically meeting the current demands. A new era of dynamic entities (nodes) within an environment like smart hospitals and cities is being empowered by IoT. The Sensor Proxy Mobile IPv6 (SPMIPv6) has been specifically determined for IP-based wireless sensor network (WSN) mobility with the aim of potentially reducing the consumption of energy by means of preserving the mobile nodes from being part of the handoff process. The majority of the shortcomings of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) such as non-optimized communication path, long handoff latency, and bottleneck issues were inherited by SPMIPV6. An improved SPMIPv6 architecture called Distributed SPMIPv6 (DSPMIPv6) is presented in this work with the aim of addressing the aforementioned problems. The solution proffered in the present architecture includes de-coupling the entities that are part of the control and data planes; the Dynamic Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) located close to the edge of the network distributes and manages the data plane, while the control plane, is dependent on a central entity called Sensor Local Mobility Anchor (SLMA). The introduced design is evaluated analytically, and the numerical results show that the performance of the DSPMIPv6 design is better than that of both SPMIPv6 and PMIPv6 protocols in terms of Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) load, and transmission cost performance metrics. © 2005 - Ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Distributed mobility management; Handover mechanism; IP-WSN; Mobility management; PMIPv6; Previous DMAG (P-DMAG); Serving DMAG (S-DMAG)",,,,"Asian Research Publishing Network",19928645,,,,"English","J.

Recently, IoT and big data processing have promoted the use of wireless sensor networks to connect and send data to data center applications using the Internet. To do so, the implementation of an IP stack on the wireless node, or the gateway of the IP and wireless L2 network, has been proposed. Both approaches are developed to allow the application on the IP network to access L2 wireless network nodes. However, since wireless sensor networks do not require any network protocol, an IP is not essential for collecting data. Therefore, we propose a novel bridging VPN for connecting wireless networks, in which the application and wireless end nodes are not required to acknowledge an IP address or network protocol. In this way, the IP network merely serves to transport the data link frames of wireless networks. We believe that this is another style of IoT, and recommend a small IoT businesses and institutions for use of this VPN as a test bed before they start to implement an IP stack on their systems. © 2017 IEEE.","Bridge; IEEE802.14.5; IoT; SDN; VPN; ZigBee","Big data; Bridges; Data handling; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Network protocols; Sensor nodes; Virtual private networks; Wireless networks; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; As layers; Data centers; Data link protocols; IEEE802.14.5; IP addresss; IP networks; Wireless network nodes; Wireless nodes; Internet protocols","Hata, H.; NTT Com Engineering, NTT CommunicationsJapan; email: h.hata@nttceng.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509029914,,,"English","Int.

Data acquisition for EM-WNSNs faces two challenges: the dynamic IoT backhaul bandwidth and THz channel conditions that jointly impact resource utilization efficiency. Specifically, the mismatch between the demands of the EM-WNSNs and the available bandwidth of the backhaul link reduces the bandwidth efficiency of IoT backhaul or the energy efficiency of EM-WNSNs. To address the new constraints that emerge from the EM-WNSN, an On-demand Probabilistic (OP) polling scheme is proposed for the backhaul tier of EM-WNSNs which is composed of nano sinks that aggregate and transport data from nano sensors to the IoT gateway. OP polling adjusts the packet aggregation process of nano sinks according to the up-to-date network conditions. From performance evaluation, OP polling achieves an 18% higher bandwidth efficiency compared to the previously proposed On-demand Efficient (OE) polling and 69% less energy consumption compared to the greedy polling.

The proposed platform seamlessly integrates monitoring, analyzing, and localization approaches using the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, a real-time operational database, application gateways, and application program interfaces. The prototype has been validated and verified at the operating underground Hassan Kishore coal mine. Sensors for air quality parameters including temperature, humidity, CH4, CO2, and CO demonstrated an excellent performance, with regression constants always greater than 0.97 for each parameter when compared to their commercial equivalent. This framework enables real-time monitoring, identification of abnormal events (&gt;90%), and verification of a miner's localization (with &lt;1.8 m of error) in the harsh environment of underground mines.

In this regard, opportunistic networks (OppNets) present an economical means of collecting delay tolerant data from sensors to their respective gateways for providing various Smart City services. Due to the distributed nature of the network, encounter-based routing protocols achieve acceptable throughput by requiring nodes to exchange and update contact information on an encounter basis. Unfortunately, sufficient insight into the associated overhead is lacking in the literature. Hence, we contribute by modelling contact information overhead and investigating its impact on OppNet routing, particularly in terms of data exchange success and energy consumption on portable handheld devices. Our findings reveal that the expected contact information overhead in Smart City scenarios significantly reduces data exchange success and increases energy consumption on portable handheld devices, thereby threatening the feasibility of the technology. We address this issue by proposing an algorithm that can be incorporated into encounter-based routing protocols to reduce contact information overhead without compromising throughput. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the average contact information overhead, increases throughput and reduces average energy consumption. © 2017 by the authors.","Delay tolerant data; Internet of things; Opportunistic networks; Routing; Sensed data collection; Smart City; Smartphones; Wireless sensors","Cost reduction; Data acquisition; Delay tolerant networks; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Energy utilization; Hand held computers; Internet of things; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Smart city; Smartphones; Throughput; Wireless ad hoc networks; Data collection; Delay tolerant; Opportunistic networks; Routing; Wireless sensor; Data reduction","Amah, T.E.; Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)Malaysia; email: amatek008@gmail.com",,"MDPI AG",20782489,,,,"English","Information",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030153236

In this new context, several traditional challenges have to be reconsidered, among them the quality of service (QoS) issue to meet the application requirements. As a part of our approach for an autonomic QoS management at the Middleware level within the IoT, we first propose an analytical model based on queueing theory of a Middleware platform, aimed at guiding the monitoring and planning steps of the proposed autonomic management.

In an IoT fog computing system, three elements can be distinguished: IoT nodes that collect data, the cloud, and interconnected IoT gateways that exchange messages with the IoT nodes and with the cloud. This article focuses on securing IoT gateways, which are assumed to be constrained in terms of computational resources, but that are able to offload some processing from the cloud and to reduce the latency in the responses to the IoT nodes. However, it is usually taken for granted that IoT gateways have direct access to the electrical grid, which is not always the case: in mission-critical applications like natural disaster relief or environmental monitoring, it is common to deploy IoT nodes and gateways in large areas where electricity comes from solar or wind energy that charge the batteries that power every device. In this article, how to secure IoT gateway communications while minimizing power consumption is analyzed. The throughput and power consumption of Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are considered, since they are really popular, but have not been thoroughly analyzed when applied to IoT scenarios. Moreover, the most widespread Transport Layer Security (TLS) cipher suites use RSA as the main public key-exchange algorithm, but the key sizes needed are not practical for most IoT devices and cannot be scaled to high security levels. In contrast, ECC represents a much lighter and scalable alternative. Thus, RSA and ECC are compared for equivalent security levels, and power consumption and data throughput are measured using a testbed of IoT gateways. The measurements obtained indicate that, in the specific fog computing scenario proposed, ECC is clearly a much better alternative than RSA, obtaining energy consumption reductions of up to 50% and a data throughput that doubles RSA in most scenarios. These conclusions are then corroborated by a frame temporal analysis of Ethernet packets. In addition, current data compression algorithms are evaluated, concluding that, when dealing with the small payloads related to IoT applications, they do not pay off in terms of real data throughput and power consumption. © 2017 by the authors.

Sometimes taking control of one device allows the attacker to obtain secret data (such as password for home WiFi network) or tools to carry out DoS attack, and this, despite the limited resources of such devices. One of the solutions for gaining users’ confidence is to assign responsibility for detecting attacks to the service provider, particularly Internet Service Provider (ISP). It is possible, since ISP often provides also the Home Gateway (HG)—device that has multiple roles: residential router, entertainment center, and home’s “command and control” center which allows to manage the Smart Home entities. The ISP may extend this set of functionalities by implementing an intrusion detection software in HG provisioned to their customers.

The Home Gateway IDS and the ISP’s IDS constitute together a distributed structure which allows spreading computations related to attacks against Smart Home ecosystem.

With the technology standardization activities such as the Bluetooth V4.x (Bluetooth smart) have led to an explosive growth in innovative short-range wireless devices capable of providing various services to AAL. Allowing machine-to-machine (M2M) communication between these devices also presents new commercial service opportunities. Communication service providers, including telecom carriers, may need to establish new networks to accommodate M2M interactions and reinvent their business strategies. Typically, simple M2M or IoT devices need another capable device such as a smartphone to act as a gateway to the Internet to operate at their full potential. This paper investigates a novel IoT architecture in which any Internet-enabled device in the vicinity can act as an M2M gateway for IoT devices. This eliminates the need for the IoT device user to also own a smartphone or an Internet-enabled device to obtain services such as online-to-offline.

Controlling the flow of water so that it doesn't go to waste is another challenge. Water flow is generally managed through locks and manually controlling these gates often turn out to be a long-winding process. Due to recent technological progress and increased connectivity in rural areas, a system of IoT devices proved to be alternative for managing the water grid. A new Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology called LoRa is explored in our study for the communication of these IoT devices. The LoRa devices can communicate within a range of 2-4 KMs while running on batteries that last for years. As a pilot project, we implemented a smart water grid management system in Mori, a village in the eastern Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh situated near to Bay of Bengal. The water grid management system proposed in this paper involves different sensors deployed at various strategically chosen locations to measure the quality of water by generating real time data. The system also provides an alert mechanism which notifies the different level of authorities through email and SMS in case of any issues. Furthermore, it provides a solution for handling the locks that have been employed in and around the village to control the flow of water in a timely manner. The sensors attached with a micro controller in the LoRa module will communicate to the cloud environment through the LoRa gateway. A web page provides the interface to the residents and to the authorities to gauge the water quality after analyzing the data using the prediction algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Ericsson Cloud; IoT Sensors; LoRa; LPWAN; Water Grid","Flow of water; Gateways (computer networks); Information management; Locks (fasteners); Low power electronics; Rural areas; Water quality; Websites; Wide area networks; Cloud environments; Ericsson; LoRa; LPWAN; Prediction algorithms; Quality of water; Recent technological progress; World population; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509058730,,,"English","GIoTS - Glob.

The emergence of edge/fog computing as a compute model has further highlighted the need of a uniform model to cater to the inherent heterogeneity of participating devices. In several domains, the devices may range from standard compute and communication devices to gateways/switches, as well as robots/drones and other types of autonomous entities. In scenarios like disaster management, warehouse automation, surveillance etc. use of robots/drones/AGVs/UAVs is steadily increasing in order to minimise potentially hazardous human intervention. Optimality of data exchange and further processing is a desired feature in such scenarios, especially in outdoor disaster situations where availability of the back-end cloud infrastructure can not be guaranteed. In this paper, we demonstrate a real life robotic data exchange model based on Resource Description Framework (RDF). We further perform a comparative analysis of network performance between TCP in Robot Operating System (ROS) and block-wise extension to Constrained Application Layer Protocol (CoAP) for bidirectional exchange of such RDF data in a disaster situation where robotic entities accomplish search and rescue missions in collaboration with fog devices.

At present, the norm is the static allocation of tasks by developers of an application, where some IoT applications are allocated to be performed on the Cloud, some on the Fog, and some on a hybrid Cloud-Fog. The applications are pre-programmed and predefined to be run on a platform, and this is unchangeable at run-time. IoT gateways, which are devices that bridge the IoT local network and the Internet, are in a position to make dynamic adjustments and allocation decision between platforms based upon real-time conditions such as an IoT applications' performance. However, currently there is no (or very little) intelligence embedded into IoT gateways. This paper proposes cognitive IoT gateways powered by cognitive analytics and machine learning to improve the performance of IoT applications. These IoT devices are able to automatically learn and decide when and where to run an application, be that on the Cloud or on the Fog.

Billions of IoT devices are expected to connect to the Internet in the near future. These devices differ from the traditional devices operated in the Internet. In this work, we argue that an Information Centric Networking (ICN), a new networking paradigm, is a more suitable architecture for the IoT compared to the currently prevailing IP based network. We observe that recent works that propose to use ICN for IoT, either do not cover the need to integrate Sensor Networks with the Internet to realize IoT or do so inefficiently. There is a need to understand effective ways to integrate the various heterogeneous Sensor Networks with the Internet without affecting their current mode of operation. In this work, we study the essential requirements for integrating Sensor Networks to the Internet. We provide an architecture with Gateways for paving a way for the Sensor Networks to become a part of the IoT family. We further provide a naming schema for efficient operation of the resource constrained Sensor Networks, discuss mobility, security, communication patterns and propose the most suitable choices for IoT networks.

Compared to classic Bluetooth, BLE has been simplified in many ways that include its connection establishment, data exchange, and encryption processes. Unfortunately, this simplification comes at a cost. For example, only a star topology is supported in BLE environments and a peripheral (an IoT device) can communicate with only one gateway (e.g. a smartphone, or a BLE hub) at any given set time. When a peripheral goes out of range and thus loses connectivity to a gateway, it cannot connect and seamlessly communicate with another gateway without user interventions. In other words, BLE connections are not automatically migrated or handed-off to another gateway. In this paper, we propose SeamBlue, which brings secure seamless connectivity to BLE-capable mobile IoT devices in an environment that consists of a network of gateways. Our framework ensures that unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf BLE devices seamlessly and securely connect to a nearby gateway without any user intervention.

Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh.

In this paper we consider a WSN deployed for an application such as environment monitoring, and a mobile sink which acts as the gateway between the Internet and the WSN. Data gathering is a challenging problem in WSNs and in the IoT because the information has to be available quickly and effectively without delays and redundancies. In this paper we propose several distributed algorithms for composite event detection and reporting to a mobile sink. Once data is collected by the sink, it can be shared using the IoT infrastructure. We analyze the performance of our algorithms using WSNet simulator, which is specially designed for event-based WSNs.

These applications require a reconfigurable sensor architecture that can span multiple scenarios, devices and use cases that allow storage, networking and computational resources to be efficiently used on the edge of the network. There are a number of platforms and gateway architectures that have been proposed to manage these components and enable application deployment. These approaches lack horizontal integration between multiple providers as well as higher order functionalities like load balancing and clustering. This is partly due to the strongly coupled nature of the deployed applications, a lack of abstraction of device communication layers as well as a lock-in for communication protocols. This limitation is a major obstacle for the development of a protocol agnostic application environment that allows for single application to be migrated and to work with multiple peripheral devices with varying protocols from different local gateways. This research looks at existing platforms and their shortcomings as well as proposes a messaging based modular gateway platform that enables clustering of gateways and the abstraction of peripheral communication protocol details. These novelties allow applications to send and receive messages regardless of their deployment location and destination device protocol, creating a more uniform development environment. Furthermore, it results in a more streamlined application development and testing while providing more efficient use of the gateway's resources. Our evaluation of a prototype for the system shows the need for the migration of resources and the QoS advantages of such a system. The examined use case scenarios show that clustering proves to be an advantage in certain use cases as well as presenting the deployment of a larger testing and control environment through the platform. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud manufacturing; Fog Computing; Gateway; Horizontal integration; Internet of Things; MQTT; OSGI","Abstracting; Fog; Industrial research; Internet of things; Network architecture; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Reconfigurable architectures; Application development; Application environment; Cloud Manufacturing; Development environment; Horizontal integrations; Internet of Things (IOT); MQTT; OSGI; Gateways (computer networks)","Verba, N.; Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing, Coventry UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: verban@coventry.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",14740346,,,,"English","Adv.

In addition, groups of end users are encouraged to form the so-called energy districts in which the energy is exchanged locally or negotiated, without intermediaries, directly with the energy provider.

Power Cloud injects smartness into the management of an energy district by supplying a distributed computing layer that controls the physical devices of the end users, and interacts with a centralized cloud component that manages the whole district. In particular, each end user dwelling is equipped with a Smart Energy Aware Gateway (SEAG), which monitors and controls a nanogrid and a home automation system.

In this paper, we focus on the experimental evaluation of latency in IoT service composition with mobile gateways (GWs). We measure latency between system components and quantify application protocol overheads to assess the capabilities and limitations of a standard M2M middleware.

Our results show that while the latency added by a broker lies around 25 ms, the cellular network often exceeds 1 s, becoming a problem for interactive applications.

A gateway typically supports multiple wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and each WSN might use a different technology for communication. Hence gateways are designed to be heterogeneous, having necessary hardware support only for those technologies corresponding to their associated WSNs. Due to their heterogeneity, the technology specific channel access mechanisms need not provide fairness in data communication at each gateway. In this paper, we propose two centralized techniques that involve an efficient link selection per technology and time based scheduling among gateways. This improves fairness in data transmission for every gateway, resulting in an increased data transmission.

The resource may be an entity (virtual or physical) that constitutes the IoT system, such as network elements, gateways, cloud data stores, and sensors. The dynamic and constantly changing nature of request by a typical user for resource allocation demands end-to-end slices of an IoT system. In order to meet such requests, end-to-end slices need to be integrated, ultimately making it necessary to control and aggregate diverse types of resources from IoT, cloud infrastructures, and network functions. To that end, in this paper, we propose a framework for IoT resources management and provisioning. Our proposed approach enables to automate resource management and provisioning for users across IoT, clouds, and network functions by virtualizing access to underlying IoT resources and utilizing APIs to employ those resources. Furthermore, our proposed approach aims to establish and manage end-to-end slices of various types of resources from distributed and diverse infrastructure. In this paper, we present multiFIA - multi-dimensional Future Internet Architecture - which permits IoT system designers to accommodate multiple user demands by establishing end-to-end slices of the overall IoT network.

The centralized scenario is a classical approach of SDN. However, the semi-distributed scenario consists in introducing different level of control: principal controller, secondary controllers, and local controllers nodes. In order to adapt the architecture to network topology, we use Connected Dominating Sets (CDS) algorithm to select a relevant subset of nodes able to act as local controllers. The selection strategy is proposed using fuzzy set approach based on different network parameters: connectivity degree, link quality, and the distance in terms of hop number from the gateway. The obtained results show that the selection strategy gives good results in terms of local controller selection. © 2017 IEEE.","Centralized/distributed and semi-distributed; Conected Dominated Set (CDS); Internet of Things; Software Defined Networks (SDN)","Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Mobile computing; Network architecture; Wireless telecommunication systems; Connected dominating sets; Connectivity degree; Internet of Things (IOT); Network parameters; Principal controllers; Programmable architectures; Resources management; Semi-distributed; Controllers",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043729,,,"English","Int.

Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification. The system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes and a fog layer altogether taking advantage of IoT. The sensor nodes collect and wirelessly transmit ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature to a smart gateway which can be accessed by appropriate care-givers.

In EM-WNSNs, nano sinks that aggregate data from nano sensors to the Internet of Things (IoT) gateway collectively form a backhaul tier of EM-WNSNs. Unlike the data tier composed of densely deployed nano sensors that are closely connected, the backhaul tier consisting of less dense nano sinks is highly vulnerable to the dynamic channel states of THz band that is sensitive to the surrounding humidity change. Thus, a forwarding scheme that adapts to dynamic channel states is needed to ensure both connectivity and efficiency of data transfers over the backhaul. Current channel-aware approaches are based on complex hardware support that cannot be deployed on nano devices due to the size constraints. To solve this problem, the Time-To-Live (TTL)-based Efficient Forwarding (TEFoward) with low complexity is proposed for the backhaul tier of multi-hop polling-based EM-WNSNs. In TEFoward, the functions carried by polling beacons are diversified besides data extraction. Nano sinks select forwarders and direct packets based on the duplicate counts and TTL values of polling beacons which reflect the latest topology information. Demanding lightweight resource support, TEFoward achieves high end-to-end data delivery ratio and energy efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Complex networks; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Complex hardware; Data extraction; Dynamic channels; Internet of thing (IOT); Multi-hop polling; Sensing resolution; Size constraint; Topology information; Nanosensors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509061969,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

In this work, we describe TSTP's MAC in detail and show how it is a fundamental part of TSTP's design, orchestrating the interaction between several integrated components across the network. TSTP MAC is derived from RB-MAC, handling collision avoidance, duty cycling and greedy, fully-reactive geographic routing without any exchange of control messages, enabling receivers to achieve ultra-low duty cycles (e.g. 0.5% for 265ms per-hop delay), but taking the toll on senders, which must occupy the channel with a relatively long packetized preamble before each transmission. We also show how TSTP MAC itself can leverage clock synchronization it makes possible to TSTP to make senders only transmit critical portions of the preamble by predicting when there will possibly be receivers awake. We show that this optimization can achieve a 70% reduction in preamble transmission even in a non-ideal case, while not introducing any control messages and not affecting receiver duty cycle. © 2016 IEEE.","Clock Synchronization; Cross-Layer Communication Protocol; Geographic; MAC; Wireless Sensor Networks","Application programming interfaces (API); Clocks; Distributed computer systems; Gateways (computer networks); Mechanical clocks; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Application-oriented; Clock Synchronization; Control messages; Cross-layer communications; Data-communication; Geographic; Geographic routing; Low duty-cycles; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035939,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

As the sizes of the IoT data continue to grow, it becomes inefficient to transfer all the raw data to a centralised, cloud-based data centre and to perform efficient analytics even with the state-of-the-art big data processing technologies. To address the problem, this article demonstrates the idea of 'distributed intelligence' for sensor data computing, which disperses intelligent computation to the much smaller while autonomous units, e.g., sensor network gateways, smart phones or edge clouds in order to reduce data sizes and to provide high quality data for data centres. As these autonomous units are usually in close proximity to data consumers, they also provide potential for reduced latency and improved quality of services.

In certain sense, indoor air quality must be paid more attention than outdoor air quality as people spend more time indoors than outdoors. The indoor environments are confined and closed compared to external environments providing less opportunity for the pollutants to dilute. With the advancement of technology, working places have become more automated using machines to carry out the tasks that were hitherto done manually. These devices emit various solids and gases into the environment during their operation. These emissions contain many substances that are harmful to human health, when exposed to them for a prolonged period of time or more than certain levels of concentration. This paper proposes an IoT based indoor air quality monitoring system for tracking the ozone concentrations near a photocopy machine. The experimental system with a semiconductor sensor capable of monitoring ozone concentrations was installed near a high volume photocopier. The IoT device has been programmed to collect and transmit data at an interval of five minutes over blue tooth connection to a gateway node that in turn communicates with the processing node via the WiFi local area network. The sensor was calibrated using the standard calibration methods. As an additional capability, the proposed air pollution monitoring system can generate warnings when the pollution level exceeds beyond a predetermined threshold value. © 2017 IEEE.","Indoor air quality; Internet of Things; Ozone; Photocopier; Primary pollutants; Secondary pollutants","Air pollution; Air quality; Calibration; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Monitoring; Ozone; Photocopying; Pollution; Wi-Fi; Air pollution monitoring; External environments; Indoor air quality; Indoor air quality monitoring; Photocopier; Primary pollutants; Secondary pollutants; Semiconductor sensors; Indoor air pollution",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062201,,,"English","Proc.

With the growth of IoT devices today, these systems can easily overwhelm message brokers unless the software can fully utilize hardware resources such as multi-core facility. This paper presents muMQ, a high-performance MQTT broker running on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf hardware. It tackles the challenge to improve the performance of message brokering on a single machine by efficiently utilizing multi-core CPUs. First, muMQ exploits an event-driven I/O mechanism for multi-core scalability. Each CPU core equally handles dispatched TCP connections and locally processes MQTT logic. Second, muMQ adopts a user-level TCP/IP stack, mTCP with DPDK, to avoid the overhead of the in-kernel TCP/IP stack, including system call overhead and resource contention. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments. The results show that muMQ can handle 512K or greater long-lived subscribers with no message loss; muMQ achieves a publish messaging rate at 930K messages per second, which is 5.38 times faster than an existing MQTT broker. We also confirm mTCP accelerates the performance by 1.8 times compared with muMQ using the in-kernel TCP/IP stack. © 2017 IEEE.","high performance computing; message broker; MQTT; multi-core system; user-level TCP/IP stack","Computation theory; Gateways (computer networks); Hardware; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Program processors; Transmission control protocol; High performance computing; Message brokers; MQTT; Multi-core systems; User levels; Metropolitan area networks",,,"IEEE Computer Society",19440367,9781538607282,,,"English","IEEE Workshop Local Metrop.

Current IoT gateways solve the communication gap between field control/sensor nodes and customer cloud, enabling field data to be harnessed for manufacturing process optimization, remote management, and preventive maintenance. However, these gateways do not support fully-automatic configuration of newly added IoT devices. In this paper, we proposed a self-configurable gateway featuring real time detection and configuration of smart things over the wireless networks.

However, designing a secure and reliable authentication scheme for WSNs that can be deployed in IoT remains a research and operational challenge. For example, recently in 2016, Amin and Biswas showed that the Turcanović et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to smart card loss attack, user impersonation attack, etc. They then proposed a new authentication scheme for WSNs with multi-gateway. In this paper, we revisit the scheme of Amin and Biswas and reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities in the scheme (i.e. sensor capture attack, user forgery attack, gateway forgery attack, sensor forgery attack and off-line guessing attack). In addition, we demonstrate that the user in the scheme can be tracked due to the use of a constant pseudo-identity and previously established session keys can be calculated by the attacker. Rather than attempting to fix a broken scheme, we present a novel authentication scheme for multi-gateway based WSNs. We then demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme using Proverif, as well as evaluating the good performance of the scheme using NS-2 simulation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-gateway; Sensor capture attack; Smart card; User anonymity; Wireless sensor network","Authentication; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Network security; Smart cards; Transportation; Authentication scheme; Efficient authentication; Internet of Things (IOT); Operational challenges; Pseudo identities; User anonymity; User impersonation attacks; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks","Li, X.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: lixiongzhq@163.com",,"Academic Press",10848045,,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009936481

However, they must compete for bandwidth with traditional applications such as video streaming, video conferencing and bulk file transfers. Such competition can be detrimental to the IoT applications when home gateways use traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue management. Simply increasing bandwidth between the home gateway and the ISP, even when possible, provides no guarantee of bandwidth for IoT applications since many traditional applications will consume as much bandwidth as is available. In this paper we explore whether Active Queue Management (AQM), now being implemented in home gateways, can provide protection for IoT flows. We investigate the effect of different AQM algorithms deployed at the home gateway in scenarios with multiple concurrent application flows. We find that deploying multi-queue FQ-CoDel or the hybrid &#x201C;FQ-PIE&#x201D; at the home gateway can provide excellent capacity sharing, flow isolation and good protection in terms of throughput and queuing delays for IoT flows and other applications, which cannot be achieved with traditional FIFO or other single-queue AQMs such as PIE.

The data is sent using various wireless technologies to application servers present in the IoT cloud via intermediate gateways. Using traditional routing techniques to connect millions of IoT devices to the Internet result in congestion and overloading of gateways leading to drop in throughput of IoT networks. To improve the throughput, the use of multiple wireless technologies for parallel data transmission known as Parallel Opportunistic Routing (POR) has been proposed in the literature. However, in POR the data from a source gateway to the Internet always follows the same path. This leads to congestion in certain gateways which in turn affects the throughput. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive and load balanced routing technique called Adaptive Routing using Multi-technologY and Load balancer (ARMY-Lancer) for maximizing IoT networks' throughput by distributing the load across the network.

We model the system, including detailed network interface power consumption and latency, using linear programming (LP), thus building a useful tool for analysing and comparing network performance under different configurations. For a given set of packets to be transmitted and a given set of networks available, the model decides the best scheduling according to a cost function and ensuring that no deadline is missed. Our results show that a schedule minimising the energy consumption can reduce in 79% the total energy consumed when compared to a schedule that minimises delivery times, and thus allowing smartphones to achieve longer battery life.

The standard presents Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, which provides high reliability and low power consumption to various industrial applications. Despite the effectiveness and the importance of the TSCH protocol, the standard leaves out of its scope in defining how the schedule is built and maintained. In this work, we focus on scheduling in IEEE 802.15.4-2015 TSCH networks from the energy efficiency perspective in a centralized manner where the gateway makes frequency allocations and time slot assignments. At first, we derive an energy consumption model of a TSCH node to determine the network lifetime. Afterwards, we formulate the scheduling problem as an energy efficiency maximization problem, which is a nonlinear integer programming. Motivated by the high computational complexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity Energy Efficient Scheduler (EES) and Vogel's Approximation Method Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm (VAM-HSA). We make a comparison with the Round Robin Scheduler (RRS) and analyse the schedulers in terms of success probability and energy efficiency. Performance evaluation indicates that EES and VAM-HSA perform better in terms of energy efficiency, while at the same time yielding a good throughput. © 2017 IEEE.","Centralized Scheduling; Energy Consumption; Energy Efficiency; Heuristics; IEEE 802.15.4-2015; IEEE 802.15.4e; Internet of Things; TSCH; Wireless Sensor Networks","Access control; Approximation algorithms; Approximation theory; Complex networks; Computational efficiency; Energy utilization; Frequency allocation; Gateways (computer networks); Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Internet of things; Medium access control; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Standards; Wireless sensor networks; Centralized scheduling; Heuristics; IEEE 802.15.4; IEEE 802.15.4e; TSCH; Energy efficiency",,"Papadias C.B.Jamalipour A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015252,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In this context, cloud computing has emerged as a promising paradigm due to its enormous storage and computing capabilities, thus leading to the IoT-Cloud convergence. In such a framework, IoT devices can be grouped into several clusters and each cluster head can send the aggregated information to the cloud via a gateway for further processing. Although a number of clustering methods have been proposed for the conventional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), it is important to consider specific IoT characteristics while adapting these techniques for wireless IoT networks. One of the important features of IoT networks that can be exploited while developing clustering techniques is the collaborations among heterogeneous IoT devices. In this regard, the network-wide knowledge at the cloud center can be useful to provide information about the device relations to the IoT gateway. Motivated by this, we propose and evaluate a cloud-assisted device interaction-aware clustering scheme for heterogeneous IoT networks. The proposed method considers the joint impact of residual energy and device closeness factor for the effective selection of cluster heads.

As an example of mobile IoT scenarios, in robotic deployments, computationally intensive tasks such as run time mapping may be performed on peer robots or smart gateways. Most of these computational tasks involve running optimization algorithms inside compute nodes at run time and taking rapid decisions based on results. In this paper, we incorporate optimization libraries within the Robot Operating System (ROS) deployed on robotic sensor-actuators. Using the ROS based simulation environment Gazebo, we demonstrate case-study scenarios for runtime optimization. The use of optimized distributed computations are shown to provide significant improvement in latency and battery saving for large computational loads.

Among the most promising approaches, SIGFOX stands out as an ultra-narrow band technology that allows similar signal coverage to that of cellular networks at one thousandth of its power requirements. In this paper, we analyze a SIGFOX-based heterogeneous network architecture, based on combining an ultra-low-power star network topology for short distance communications and SIGFOX as Internet Gateway for the low-power devices. By following this approach, clusters of IIoT devices are able to communicate with a nearby SIGFOX Gateway that reports the sensed data to the Internet. Extensive experimentation and energy modeling has been performed.

This combines the ubiquity of the IoT with the processing capabilities of cloud computing to generate insights that help to optimize the decision making process. The increasing demand of data and the explosion in the number of sensing devices, which might be highly constrained in terms of communication, battery and computational power, introduce new challenges that need efficient IoT-Cloud architectures. With this in mind, we extend MQTT, the de facto IoT communication protocol, using a fog computing approach that introduces a low complexity computational layer between the Cloud and IoT nodes. In this approach, the MQTT broker, which is in charge of relaying data from publishers to subscribers, is placed at the fog layer. The purpose of introducing an intermediate layer to this particular scenario is to: i) predict future data measurements through prediction techniques; ii) operate as a gateway to upper layers; and iii) provide the capability to offload computationally expensive data processing jobs from the Cloud to the Fog, minimizing additional latency and operational expenses. With this architecture, the transmissions required from IoT devices may be reduced, since the publishers would only need to update the predicted data in case of mismatching. We validate our approach with an energy consumption analysis and simulations of different Machine Learning algorithms on a real dataset, and compare it with the traditional MQTT scheme. © 2017 IEEE.","energy efficiency; fog computing; Industrial IoT; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things; IoT; Machine Learning; MQTT","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Education; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fog; Gateways (computer networks); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Ubiquitous computing; Cloud architectures; Decision making process; Energy consumption analysis; Industrial IoT; Manufacturing technologies; MQTT; Prediction techniques; Processing capability; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509055821,,,"English","Proc.

Unfortunately, IoT systems also present several important challenges to developers. This paper proposes a vision for how we may build IoT systems in the future by reconceiving IoT's fundamental unit of construction not as a 'thing', but rather as a widely and finely distributed 'microservice' already familiar to web service engineering circles. Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles. Our hope is that the vision of a microservices approach will help focus research that can fill in current gaps preventing more effective, interoperable, and secure IoT services and solutions in a wide variety of contexts. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Access control; Interoperability; Systems engineering; Web services; Autonomous Vehicles; Case-studies; Fundamental units; Internet of thing (IOT); Iot services; Personal health managements; Service discovery; Web service engineering; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509063208,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

It is intended to be used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving battery-powered devices with low throughput requirements. A LoRaWAN network consists of multiple end nodes that communicate with one or more gateways. These gateways act like a transparent bridge towards a common network server. The amount of end devices and their throughput requirements will have an impact on the performance of the LoRaWAN network. This study investigates the scalability in terms of the number of end devices per gateway of single-gateway LoRaWAN deployments. First, we determine the intra-technology interference behavior with two physical end nodes, by checking the impact of an interfering node on a transmitting node. Measurements show that even under concurrent transmission, one of the packets can be received under certain conditions. Based on these measurements, we create a simulation model for assessing the scalability of a single gateway LoRaWAN network. We show that when the number of nodes increases up to 1000 per gateway, the losses will be up to 32%. In such a case, pure Aloha will have around 90% losses. However, when the duty cycle of the application layer becomes lower than the allowed radio duty cycle of 1%, losses will be even lower. We also show network scalability simulation results for some IoT use cases based on real data. © 2017 by the authors.

With the capability to bridge application layer with sensing layer, gateway usually possesses multiple threads. Reasonably scheduling these threads matters most to the performance of gateway even the environmental monitoring system. Targeting at reasonable schedule, a kind of multiple threads schedule algorithm was researched and developed (MTSA) to weaken data jam by suitable duration of pending each thread and reasonable control for the execution sequence of thread. This duration was subject to the interval between two operations of pushing data from gateway to Web Server, the number of threads, and the relationship between maximal and effective power consumption. In order to overcome the difficulty in deciding the duration of pending each thread just by experience, the multiple threads integrated into the gateway of the environmental monitoring system were firstly displayed, and then the specific steps of MTSA were presented. In addition, the duration of pending each thread in MTSA was determined by taking the relationship between the maximal and effective power consumption into consideration, and the impact of MTSA on weakening data jam was also analyzed. With the purpose of demonstrating the performance of MTSA, a field experiment in the grape greenhouse was carried out. In this experiment, the comparison between MTSA and a popular algorithm of heuristic method (HM) was done in terms of decreasing the data loss to check the higher efficiency of MTSA than HM in guaranteeing that Web was capable of receiving the environment data, including temperature, relative humidity and illumine. As for the experiment results, data loss by NTSA was only 3.4%, which was much more less than that of 56% by HM, which verified the use of MSTA. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

IoT operates for a large number of applications, and one of these include the sensor deployment for data support to clients.

These issues can be easily tackled by deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which serve as dynamic nodes to handle clients' queries by acting as on-demand gateways. However, this UAV-assisted IoT requires efficient localisation to determine the sensor for handling multiple-content queries, which is considered as a problem. A cost function is formed in the proposed approach to generate an optimisation problem which is resolved using a radial basis function kernel support vector machine. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in terms of significant gains attained in terms of error in the cost function, overheads in handling queries, and accuracy in UAV allocation. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Cost functions; Internet of things; Network components; Optimization; Radial basis function networks; Content queries; Content-based; Dynamic nodes; Optimisation problems; Radial basis function kernels; Sensor deployment; Service applications; Time availability; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Kumar, R.; Computer Science and Engineering Department, Thapar UniversityIndia; email: ravinder@thapar.edu",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",00135194,,ELLEA,,"English","Electron.

The Internet of Thing (IOT) is a wireless sensor networks. Because a WSN is an open wireless communication network, it is vulnerable to security threats and attacks. It must authenticate its partner's identity and protect collection data to avoid eavesdropping or data destruction. This paper proposes a secure data collection scheme for WSNs. In this scheme, a collector, such as the pilotless plane, authenticates the identity of a smart card owner without a gateway node. Sensor nodes verify the collector, which is activated by an authorized smart card owner, and transmit data to the collector through a secure channel. The collector also authenticates whether the collected data are derived from valid sensor nodes. This design reduces communication cost and provides a secure channel to achieve data integrity and confidentiality; mutual authentication; and increased resistance to malicious insider attacks, password guessing attacks, and replay attacks.) The proposed scheme also can apply to the scenario of Internet of Thing to robust its security. © 2017 IEEE.","Authentication; Internet of Thing; Secure data collection; Wireless sensor network","Authentication; Cryptography; Data acquisition; Gateways (computer networks); Health risks; Internet of things; Network security; Security systems; Sensor nodes; Smart cards; Transportation; Wireless telecommunication systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Malicious insiders; Mutual authentication; Password guessing attack; Real time traffics; Secure data; Wireless communication network; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",,"Enokido T.Takizawa M.Lin C.-Y.Hsu H.-H.Barolli L.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062300,,,"English","Proc.

For this vital Internet connection, most current IoT devices use a personal gateway device such as a smartphone or a home WiFi access point. The necessity of configuring and maintaining these gateways presents an additional burden for both users and developers of IoT applications. Our vision for IoT connectivity is to eliminate the need for the personal gateway by developing crowdsourced low-power wide area networks (csLPWAN). Recent technologies such as RPMA, LoRa, and R-FDMA enable links to reach 15km using ISM-band transceivers, making csLPWANs an attractive option. In this paper, we investigate the practicality of csLPWANs and develop the first csLPWAN planning tool, PlanIt, which combines topography-aware RF signal analysis with demographic data to predict LPWAN coverage in specific geographic areas. Using PlanIt, we find that most cities achieve 99% coverage by deploying a single LPWAN base station within the city. To provide better service on the csLPWAN, we propose and evaluate D-QN, a near-optimal MAC protocol to enable efficient bandwidth sharing in highly utilized networks. In the future, csLPWANs could accommodate a heterogeneous set of IoT applications, simplifying the IoT application development cycle, reducing total system cost, improving application reliability, and enhancing the user experience. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Frequency division multiple access; Gateways (computer networks); Low power electronics; Medium access control; Ubiquitous computing; Wide area networks; Application reliabilities; Demographic data; Efficient bandwidth; Geographic areas; Internet connection; Internet of thing (IOT); IOT applications; Wi-fi access points; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509043279,,,"English","IEEE Int.

In such an architecture, a multiple access control procedure is necessary between machines and a cognitive gateway. It is critical for machines to opportunistically use idle spectrum time to send data to a cognitive gateway while considers energy consumption of machines. In this paper, we propose a packet reservation multiple access with cross multi-frames in cognitive capillary machine type communication networks. In the proposed scheme, machines could reserve time slots across successive multi-frames in order to avoid collisions.

Because of the popularity and high accessibility, a smartphone becomes not only an effective terminal in personal data collection but also a gateway to connect wearable devices and gather various kinds of personal data from these wearables. In the most of current applications, the wearables work for data collection according to a fixed schedule often preset manually by a user. The main problems in the data collection with following such fixed scheduling are weak adaptiveness to wearables' state change, big redundancy in collected data, and possible mismatch to dynamic precision requirements in data capture. Therefore, we propose a context-aware scheduling mechanism that is able to dynamically adjust the data collection schedule based on varying situations of wearable condition, network availability, computing resource and user state. This paper presents the details of this context-aware scheduling mechanism, and a corresponding smartphone-based system to collect personal data from multiple wearables and upload the gathered data to a server.

FlexBox field data has begun shedding light on relationships between ambient temperature and load energy consumption, load and building envelope energy efficiency challenges, latency communication network challenges, and opportunities to engage existing demand-side user behavioral patterns.

To provide good communication for the increasing number of smart applications, there is a need for low cost and long range Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies. LoRaWAN is an energy efficient and inexpensive LPWAN solution that is rapidly being adopted all around the world. However, LoRaWAN does not guarantee reliable communication in its basic configuration. Transmified frames can be lost due to the channel effects and mobility of the end-devices. In this study, we perform extensive measurements on a new LoRaWAN network to characterise spatial and temporal properties of the LoRaWAN channel. The empirical outage probability for the farthest measured distance from the closest gateway of 7.5 km in our deployment is as low as 0.004, but the frame loss measured at this distance was up to 70%. Furthermore, we show that burstiness in frame loss can be expected for both mobile and stationary scenarios. Frame loss results in data loss, since in the basic configuration frames are only transmified once. To reduce data loss in LoRaWAN, we design a novel coding scheme for data recovery called DaRe, which extends frames with redundant information that is calculated from the data from previous frames. DaRe combines techniques from convolutional codes and fountain codes. We develop an implementation for DaRe and show that 99% of the data can be recovered with a code rate of 1/2 for up to 40% frame loss. Compared to repetition coding DaRe provides 21% more data recovery, and can save up to 42% energy consumption on transmission for 10 byte data units. DaRe also provides better resilience to bursty frame loss. This study provides useful results to both LoRaWAN network operators as well as developers of LoRaWAN applications. Network operators can use the characterisation results to identify possible weaknesses in the network, and application developers are o?ered a tool to prevent possible data loss. © 2017 ACM.","Application layer coding; Burstiness; Channel coding; Convolutional code; DaRe; Data recovery; Erasure coding; Forward error correction; Fountain code; LoRa; LoRaWAN; LPWAN; Network measurements","Channel coding; Computer system recovery; Convolution; Convolutional codes; Data communication systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Error correction; Forward error correction; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Low power electronics; Recovery; Wide area networks; Application layer coding; Burstiness; DaRe; Data recovery; Erasure coding; Fountain codes; LoRa; LoRaWAN; LPWAN; Network measurement; Codes (symbols)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450349666,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

To this purpose, we have designed, implemented, and thoroughly evaluated the PRESS framework, which is capable of achieving good flexibility and scalability while integrating heterogeneous monitoring data, ranging from sensed air pollution to user-provided quality perceptions.

Many researchers have developed monitoring and automation system for different functionalities of farming. Using WSN, data acquisition and transmission between IoT devices deployed in farms will be easy. In proposed technique, Kalman filter (KF) is used with prediction analysis to acquire quality data without any noise and to transmit this data for cluster-based WSNs. Due to the use of this approach, the quality of data used for analysis is improved as well as data transfer overhead is minimized in WSN application. Decision tree is used for decision making using prediction analytics for crop yield prediction, crop classification, soil classification, weather prediction, and crop disease prediction.

M2M communication features a myriad of devices (machines), generating a massive number of intermittent, small-sized data transmissions. Traditionally, gateways are used to provide wireless connectivity to such a large number of devices. However, with the emerging concept of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G wireless technology, the number of devices is expected to increase exponentially. This exponential increase in the number of devices raises a significant question in the ability of traditional gateways to provide connectivity and schedule uplink transmissions. In this paper, we propose a novel Grouping and Adaptive Compression (GAC) strategy in the M2M gateways to reduce the number of uplink requests. The gateways first group the machines into different clusters and subsequently explore adaptive compression to reduce the uplink traffic to the base stations (BS). Simulation results on typical M2M communications demonstrate that our proposed GAC algorithm reduces the number of uplink requests and corresponding radio resource requirement by around 60% and 50%, respectively. Moreover, it also increases the existing BS capacity by almost 10 times in terms of M2M devices, thus addressing the key challenge of the exponential increase in M2M deployment. © 2017 IETE","Base station; Compression; M2M communication; M2M gateway; Radio resource","Base stations; Compaction; Data communication systems; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Next generation networks; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication features; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine-to-machine (M2M); Next generation cellular networks; Next-generation wireless network; Radio resources; Up-link transmissions; Wireless connectivities; Machine-to-machine communication","Sahu, B.J.R.",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",02564602,,ITREE,,"English","IETE Tech Rev",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017258554

At this time of fast-paced adoption, it is of utmost importance to analyze how well these technologies will scale as the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things inevitably grows. In this letter, we provide a stochastic geometry framework for modeling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network, a leading LPWA technology. Our analysis formulates the unique peculiarities of LoRa, including its chirp spread-spectrum modulation technique, regulatory limitations on radio duty cycle, and use of ALOHA protocol on top, all of which are not as common in today's commercial cellular networks. We show that the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering signals using the same spreading sequence. We conclude that this fundamental limiting factor is perhaps more significant toward LoRa scalability than for instance spectrum restrictions. Our derivations for co-spreading factor interference found in LoRa networks enables rigorous scalability analysis of such networks. © 2012 IEEE.","interference analysis; Low power wide area networks; outage probability; stochastic geometry; wireless communications","Gateways (computer networks); Geometry; Low power electronics; Scalability; Spectroscopy; Stochastic systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Interference analysis; Low Power; Outage probability; Stochastic geometry; Wireless communications; Wide area networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21622337,,,,"English","IEEE Wireless Commun.

Compared to classic Bluetooth, BLE has been simplified in many ways that include its connection establishment, data exchange, and encryption processes. Unfortunately, this simplification comes at a cost. For example, only a star topology is supported in BLE environments and a peripheral (an IoT device) can communicate with only one gateway (e.g. a smartphone, or a BLE hub) at a set time. When a peripheral goes out of range, it loses connectivity to a gateway, and cannot connect and seamlessly communicate with another gateway without user interventions. In other words, BLE connections do not get automatically migrated or handed-off to another gateway. In this paper, we propose a system which brings seamless connectivity to BLE-capable mobile IoT devices in an environment that consists of a network of gateways. Our framework ensures that unmodified, commercial off-The-shelf BLE devices seamlessly and securely connect to a nearby gateway without any user intervention. © 2017 ACM.","BLE; Connection migration; IoT","Bluetooth; Cryptography; Data privacy; Electronic data interchange; Internet of things; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Commercial off the shelves; Connection migration; Internet of Things (IOT); Seamless connectivity; Smart appliances; Star topology; User intervention; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450345231,,,"English","CODASPY - Proc.

Signature matching is the most time critical operation in content aware networking. Improving broadband speed necessitates the need for hardware acceleration of signature matching to manage and safeguard all the Internet of Things (IOT) clients connected to the smart home. Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) allows the signature matching operation to be performed in linear time but has an exponential storage complexity. Bitmap based transition compression techniques are hardware friendly and can be used to achieve signature matching at multi gigabit throughput. However, its drawback is inefficient transition compression which results in storage of redundant transitions after the compression. We propose two bit masking techniques to efficiently compress transitions over existing bitmap based techniques. Compression ratios of 98% can be achieved using the proposed techniques, which in turn results in a 50% reduction of memory usage to store the compressed automata. A hardware acceleration architecture is proposed for each technique to decompress the transitions to achieve signature matching at multi gigabit rates. © 2016 IEEE.","Deep Packet Inspection; Finite Automata; Network Security; Regular Expressions; Residential Gateway and Router; Transition Compression","Automation; Finite automata; Hardware; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Network security; Routers; Compression techniques; Content-aware networkings; Deep packet inspection; Deterministic finite automata; Hardware acceleration; Internet of thing (IOT); Regular expressions; Residential gateways; Gateways (computer networks)","Shankar, S.S.; Intel Technology Asia Pte.

It has got a large success in several application areas, ranging from smart city applications to smart grids. One major challenge that should be addressed is the huge amount of data generated by the sensing devices, which make the control of sending useless data very important. To face this challenge, we present a Bayesian Inference Approach (BIA), which allows avoiding the transmission of high spatio-temporal correlated data. In this paper, BIA is based on a hierarchical architecture with simple nodes, smart gateways and data centers. Belief Propagation algorithm has been chosen for performing an approximate inference on our model in order to reconstruct the missing sensing data. BIA is evaluated based on the data collected from real sensors and according to different scenarios. The results show that our proposed approach reduces drastically the number of transmitted data and the energy consumption, while maintaining an acceptable level of data prediction accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.","Belief Propagation; Cloud; IoT; Markov Random Fields; Smart Gateway","Bayesian networks; Clouds; Distributed computer systems; Energy utilization; Inference engines; Markov processes; Smart city; Application area; Approximate inference; Bayesian inference; Belief propagation; Belief propagation algorithm; Hierarchical architectures; Internet of Things (IOT); Markov Random Fields; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509045884,,,"English","Int.

A straightforward optimization would take O(pn) time, whereas our heuristic scheme takes O(np) time where n, p denote the number of sensors and size of periods, respectively. Our heuristic scheme performs local optimization sensor by sensor, starting with the smallest to largest periods. This is based on an observation that sensors with large offsets have more choices in offsets to avoid traffic peaks than the sensors with smaller periods. A MATLAB simulation shows that our scheme excels the known scheme by M. Grenier et al. in a similar situation (aggregating periodic traffic in a controller area network) for almost all possible permutations. The performance of our scheme is very close to the straightforward optimization, which compares all possible permutations. We expect that our scheme would greatly contribute in smoothing the traffic from an ever-increasing number of IoT sensors to the gateway, reducing the burden on the access link to the Internet. © 2017 by the authors.

This article is a comparison of these two options for the system parameter of latency. Since LEO satellites move across the sky from horizon to horizon simple fixed position ground antennas cannot be used for high data channels. Rather, the ground station must scan its antenna from satellite to satellite as they move into and out of the access range of the ground station. Mechanical scanning antennas physically rotate the antenna in two directions. Electronic scanning uses a fixed position antenna and steers the antenna beam electronically to remain pointed at the satellite. This work analyzes the scanning rate of the mechanical and electronic steered antennas. Since latency is a primary concern for real time internet of things (IoT) devices and internet access, it is used as the performance metric. The results show that mechanical scanning antennas increase the overall system latency due to the slew time required to reposition the antenna from one satellite to the other.

Unfortunately, the current devices are not designed to communicate with the collocated devices which employ different communication technologies. Consequently, the communication between these devices will be realized only by using the gateway nodes. This will cause the inefficient use of wireless resources. Therefore, in this paper, a smart service system(SSS) architecture is proposed, which consists of smart service terminal (SST), and smart service network (SSN), to realize the IoT in a general environment with diverse communication networks, devices, and services. The proposed architecture has the following advantages: I) the devices in this architecture cover multiple types of terminals and sensor-actuator devices; ii) the communications network therein is a converged network, and will coordinate multiple kinds of existing and emerging networks. This converged network offers ubiquitous access for various sensors and terminals; iii) the architecture has services and applications covering all smart service areas. It also provides the adaptability to new services and applications. A SSS architecture-based smart campus system was developed and deployed. Evaluation experiments of the proposed smart campus system demonstrate the SSS's advantages over the existing counterparts, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. © 2013 IEEE.","clean slate; evolutionary approach; Internet of Things; network architecture; network heterogeneity; reconfiguration",,"Zhu, H.; College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and TelecommunicationsChina; email: hbz@njupt.edu.cn",,"Editorial Department of China Communications",16735447,,,,"English","China Commun.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018742681

Even the simplest objects will become “smart” because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Interconnection; Internet of Things; Interoperability; Smart Objects; Smartphone-centric Computing","Data acquisition; Data handling; Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Hardware; Information management; Interoperability; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software architecture; Communication technologies; Control and management; High energy consumption; Interconnection; Internet of Things (IOT); Processing capability; Smart objects; Technological advancement; Internet of things","Pace, P.; DIMES - University of CalabriaItaly; email: ppace@dimes.unical.it",,"Academic Press",10848045,,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006074230

However, how heterogeneous computing devices of IoT ecosystems can execute the data processing procedures has not been clearly explored. In this paper, we propose a framework which characterizes energy and performance requirements of the data processing applications across heterogeneous devices, from a server in the cloud and a resource-constrained gateway at edge. We focus on diverse machine learning algorithms which are key procedures for handling the large amount of IoT data. We build analytic models which automatically identify the relationship between requirements and data in a statistical way. The proposed framework also considers network communication cost and increasing processing demand. We evaluate the proposed framework on two heterogenous devices, a Raspberry Pi and a commercial Intel server. We show that the identified models can accurately estimate performance and energy requirements with less than error of 4.8% for both platforms. Based on the models, we also evaluate whether the resource-constrained gateway can process the data more efficiently than the server in the cloud. The results present that the less-powerful device can achieve better energy and performance efficiency for more than 50% of machine learning algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Ecology; Ecosystems; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Learning systems; Data processing applications; Heterogeneous computing; Heterogeneous devices; Internet of thing (IOT); Network communications; Performance efficiency; Performance requirements; Processing procedures; Learning algorithms",,"Saha H.N.Chakrabarti S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509042289,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

It gathers information from various objects and provides intelligent services through analyzing the information. To collect surrounding information, IoT employs a sensor network, which is a low-power wireless communication network with numerous sensor nodes. Sensor nodes in conventional sensor networks have short transmission range. However, it is required a sensor network with long transmission range as well as low transmission power consumption for various IoT services. Long transmission range of IoT devices affects transmission environment. Lots of sensor nodes (i.e., IoT devices) in the long range sensor network transmit data to a given gateway node in order to deliver data to a network server. The gateway node can experience serious traffic load to relay the data. It causes to drop transmission efficiency. Therefore, for efficient data transmission, a network architecture and a data transmission method for long range IoT services are necessary. This paper proposes the network and data transmission architecture for the long range sensor networks. The proposed network architecture is based on oneM2M IoT standard. It has Infrastructure Node (IN), Middle Node (MN) and Application Service Node (ASN) as network elements. In the proposed method, IN employs cloned MNs to reduce the traffic load at the MN, which is the gateway. ASN delivers data through MN or cloned MNs to the IN. Through the load balancing by the proposed method at the MN, the efficient data transmission for IoT services in long range sensor networks can be provided. The performance of the proposed method is validated by the computer simulation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data transmission; IoT; Network architecture; Sensor network","Cloning; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Low power electronics; Network management; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Servers; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Application services; Conventional sensors; Data transmission architecture; Internet of Things (IOT); Low-power sensor networks; Low-power wireless communications; Transmission efficiency; Transmission environment; Network architecture","Kim, D.-Y.; Department of Software Engineering, Changshin UniversitySouth Korea; email: kimdy@cs.ac.kr",,"Springer New York LLC",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976873271

Therefore, heterogeneous network gateway plays an important role in IoT network. However, current management of the processing in data routing technique for heterogeneous network gateway is not efficient. Also, Modbus RTU is an industrial standard protocol used in physical layer network. Will cause the node ID conflict while slave nodes have the same identical number connected to the gateway. Furthermore, if traditional gateway is used in different network architecture, the adaptability will decrease because packet forwarding control plane and data plane have been in tight couple state. To deal with these problems, this paper uses software defined networking architecture to design the DNS-like heterogeneous network smart switch. Separating control and data plane through OpenFlow can make switch become more flexible. The Slave ID problem in Modbus heterogeneous network can be solved by using smart routing in smart switch. The node connected to smart switch has to be registered in smart switch first and managed by the node name. And use two methods the exchange data: Find Path by ID and Find Path by Name, proposed in this paper and unfixed string. It improves the connection experience substantially. Eventually, we implement the node registration flow, client connection flow and client data access through the OpenFlow module in NS3 and then show our algorithm result by using Wireshark. © 2016 IEEE.","DNS-like service; gateway; heterogeneous network; OpenFlow; Software-Defined Networking","Data handling; Heterogeneous networks; Information management; Intelligent control; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Network layers; Network routing; Software defined networking; Wireless telecommunication systems; Control planes; DNS-like service; Industrial standards; Internet of thing (IOT); Openflow; Packet forwarding; Physical layers; Wireless communication standards; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509034383,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

With the development of AIoT industry, there appears an endless stream of AIoT application systems, because of the lack of analysis for AIoT system's whole architecture, the current AIoT application presents the fractional, vertical and heterogeneous characteristics. Extracting the system components and their relationship from various AIoT applications, and establishing AIoT system architecture, to achieve the AIoT's design and realization method's unification are urgent problems need to be solved. The paper analyzed the AIoT's concepts, basic features and system structure research status, and found that the IoT development and management plans from different countries and institutes played good guidance for the related researchers, however, they didn't give the specific methods that can design and realize the IoT systems, and furthermore agricultural environment's diversity and complexity determine that AIoT architecture's establishment must consider agricultural industries characteristics as a whole. Therefore, the paper firstly discussed the agricultural architecture building principles including extensibility, reusability, safety and reliability and so on, then combined with the specific needs of agricultural industry and experiences from engineering practices, put forward an AIoT hierarchical structure model, the model is divided into five layers from the bottom to the up, they are perception layer, access layer, network layer, data layer and application layer, respectively, and each layer corresponds to different communication protocols. And pointed out that AIOT hierarchical model and the corresponding protocol architecture constitute the AIoT architecture. Compared with the traditional three layers and four layers architecture, the proposed architecture added the access layer and data layer. Aiming at the problem that the majority objects in the ubiquitous environment have limited resources and computing power, the access layer emphasized that the underlying heterogeneous sensor networks can connect to the network layer seamlessly, it provides a unified abstract management interface to shield the complexity of the underlying heterogeneous sensor networks, and reduces the difficulty of building AIOT perception system. For the problem of agricultural data can not be fully used in current AIoT systems, and formed the information islands, the data layer designed and realized a service oriented architecture to solve the data exchange and sharing problems among different AIoT systems. Overall the five layers architecture's functionalities are more independent, it is advantageous to the network load balancing between each layer, and reducing the burden of enterprise network communications. Aiming at the common problems of the application of agricultural industries, according to the different objects to be monitored, analyzed the agricultural production environment monitoring IoT, plant and animal life information monitoring IoT, agricultural products quality detection and the quality safety tracing IoT, agricultural machinery operation monitoring IoT's present research situation and main technologies involved. From the perspective of agricultural application architecture, it was found that the current researches are more concentrated on the gateway hardware, and the embedded gateway middleware application is relatively few on the one hand, on the other hand the AIOT data sharing layer's research is seriously lacking, each application system usually sent the perceive data directly to the AIOT application layer, therefore it is difficult to achieve the effect of further guiding to agricultural production for the lack of data mining and analysis. Finally, the paper discussed the further research and application direction of the AIoT technology.","Agricultural internet of things; Application area; Architecture model; Development direction; System structure",,,,"Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica",05781752,,,,"Chinese","Sci.

Since IoT is a fast growing, dynamic domain, the implementation of software components are subject to frequent changes addressing bug fixes, quality insurance or changed requirements. To ensure the continuous monitoring and control of processes, software updates have to be conducted while the nodes are operating without losing any sensed data or actuator instructions. Current IoT solutions usually support the centralized management and automated deployment of updates but are restricted to broadcasting the updates and local update processes at all nodes. In this paper we propose an update mechanism for IoT deployments that considers dependencies between services across multiple nodes involved in a common service and supports a coordinated update of component instances on distributed nodes.

Since automation is physically and geographically local, it is inevitable to introduce the concept of local automation clouds. It's here proposed that local automation clouds should be self contained an be able to execute the intended automation functionalities without any external resources. Thus providing a fence at the rim of the local cloud preventing any inbound or outbound communication. Such a local cloud provides possibilities to address key requirements of both todays and future automation solutions. Adding mechanisms for secure inter-cloud administration and data tranfere enables local automation cloud to meet IoT automation system requirements as: 1) Interoperability of a wide range of IoT and legacy devices 2) Automation requirement on latency guarantee/prediction for communication and control computations. 3) Scalability of automation systems enabling very large integrated automation systems 4) Security and related safety of automation systems 5) Ease of application engineering 6) Multi stakeholder integration and operations agility. How these requirements can be met in such a local automation cloud is discussed with references to proposed solutions. The local automation cloud concept is further verified for a compartment climate control application. The control application included an IoT controller, four IoT sensors and actuators, and a physical layer communication gateway. The gateway acted as host for local cloud core functionalities. The climate control application has successfully been implemented using the open source Arrowhead Framework and its supports for design and implementation of self contained local automation clouds. © 2016 IEEE.","IoT; Local automation clouds; SoS","Automation; Climate control; Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Enterprise resource planning; Gateways (computer networks); Interoperability; Network layers; Application engineering; Automation and controls; Automation solutions; Communication and control; Communication gateway; Design and implementations; Integrated automation systems; Sensors and actuators; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041305,,,"English","IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015159190

To avoid Big Data issues (e.g. high latency of cloud based IoT), the processing of the captured data is starting from the IoT edge node. However, the available processing capabilities and energy resources are still limited and do not allow to fully process the data on-board. It calls for offloading some portions of computation to the gateway or servers. Due to the limited bandwidth of the IoT gateways, choosing the offloading levels of connected devices and allocating bandwidth to them is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a technique for managing computation offloading in a local IoT network under bandwidth constraints. The existing bandwidth allocation and computation offloading management techniques underutilize the gateway's resources (e.g. bandwidth) due to the fragmentation issue. This issue stems from the discrete coarse-grained choices (i.e. offloading levels) on the IoT end nodes. Our proposed technique addresses this issue, and utilizes the available resources of the gateway effectively. The experimental results show on average 1 hour (up to 1.5 hour) improvement in battery life of edge devices. The utilization of gateway's bandwidth increased by 40%. © 2016 IEEE.","Computation Offloading; Edge Computing; Internet of Things; IoT; Resource Allocation","Bandwidth; Big data; Energy resources; Gateways (computer networks); Resource allocation; Bandwidth constraint; Coarse-grained; Computation offloading; Edge computing; Limited bandwidth; Management techniques; Processing capability; Smart devices; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041305,,,"English","IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015158214

In particular, for purposes of high availability and disaster recovery, replication of this data on cloud storage needs to be implemented efficiently. To that end, in this paper, we investigate the combined problem of uploading IoT data from a set of sensor gateways and efficient replication of this data on distributed cloud storage. While other efforts do exist in this space, either they do not consider replication in context of small size and high number of data items, which is inherent nature of IoT data or they concentrate on the access time after replication. Our solution assumes the existence of multiple distributed cloud data centers, called mini-Clouds, among which data can be replicated. We model our problem comprehensively based on various parameters such as effective bandwidth of the IoT network, available number and size of data items at each mini-Cloud; and we present our problem as a collection of various sub-problems based on subsets of these parameters. We prove that the exact solution to the problem is intractable, and we present a number of heuristic strategies to solve it. Our results show that the performance of any heuristic is bounded by the read and write latency of mini-Clouds and the best we can do is often 12 times the worst we can do for a given number of data items to be uploaded and replicated from the gateways to the mini-Clouds in test setup. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Cloud computing; Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); Disaster recovery; Distributed clouds; Effective bandwidth; Heuristic strategy; High availability; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Number of datum; Internet of things",,"Foster I.Radia N.Foster I.","IEEE Computer Society",21596182,9781509026197,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Data acquisition for EM-WNSNs face two challenges: the dynamic IoT backhaul bandwidth and THz channel conditions that jointly impact resource utilization efficiency. Specifically, the mismatch between the demands of the EM-WNSNs and the available bandwidth of the backhaul link reduces the bandwidth efficiency of IoT backhaul or the energy efficiency of EM-WNSNs. To address the new constraints that emerge from the EM-WNSN, an On-demand Efficient (OE) polling is proposed for the backhaul tier of EM-WNSNs which is composed of nano sinks that aggregate and transport data from nano sensors to the IoT gateway. The OE polling adjusts the packet aggregation process of nano sinks according to the up-to-date network conditions and we show that it achieves both high bandwidth efficiency for IoT backhaul and high energy efficiency for EM-WNSNs. To the best of our knowledge, OE polling is the first data acquisition scheme that connects EM-WNSNs with IoT by taking into consideration the dynamic IoT backhaul bandwidth and THz channel conditions. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Data acquisition; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Nanosensors; Nanotechnology; Sensor networks; Wireless sensor networks; Available bandwidth; Bandwidth efficiency; Channel conditions; High energy efficiency; Internet of thing (IOT); Packet aggregation; Resource utilizations; Sensing resolution; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052523,,,"English","2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference, IPCCC 2016",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013449878

So to realize the dream of internet of things secured device to device communication is expected. Security of resource constrained networks becomes prime important. Many existing mechanisms gives security and protection to networks and systems but they are unable to give fine grain access control. In this work, we focused on CoAP based framework to give service level access control on resource constrained devices. It gives fine grain access control on a per service basis. ECDSA is used to improve privacy of the system. Performance of CoAP based framework is compared and analyzed with existing security solutions. Test results are presented which shows that communication overhead and authentication delay are less than the existing system. Hence security performance of system gets improved.

IoTs are usually associated with the acquisition of sensor node information and controlling of ""things"". However, the absence of location information of these sensor nodes compromises the intelligence of the IoT network. Therefore, this work is motivated by the recent advances in the two important areas of WSNs namely, indoor localisation and IoTs. This paper therefore presents a framework that integrates indoor localisation of sensor nodes and IoTs in a real world scenario. The focus is mainly on the implementation issues regarding localisation algorithm complexity, hardware computational capabilities and Internet/Intranet enabled connectivity for access to the sensor nodes' location information. A sensor node prototype is developed using specialised electronic components and proprietary protocols to provide a capable platform for embedding a distributive online localisation algorithm based on Received Signal Strength (RSSI) and Gauss-Newton Algorithm (GNA). The algorithm is first simulated before porting it to the sensor node prototypes. A gateway device and an IoT framework are also proposed and implemented based on Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) server to provide global and local access to sensor nodes' location information. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the IoT logged estimated coordinates from the prototype nodes and the estimated coordinates from the simulation are computed and compared. The computational power of the hardware is analysed based the time it takes to perform the GNA based localisation process. © 2017 The Authors.

This paper, for the first time, investigates the modeling and analysis of SIET in a network where IoT nodes are powered via IoT gateways. Specifically, a Ginibre point process that captures the repulsion between spatially distributed nodes is used to model the IoT gateway network.

To achieve that, we derive closed-form expressions for these 2 probabilities in IoT for a practical case.

As the information from the sensors are transmitted via public network and sensor nodes have limited battery, shift the focus on security and efficiency in WSNs. User authentication is the security task for limiting the access. It is achieved by equipping authorized users with passwords, tokens or biometrics. However, password and token are easy being stolen and forgotten; even biometrics inherit some limitation. More suitable approach is to combine both password and biometric authenticator to harvest benefits in security. This paper proposes a novel authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs using biohashing. Biohashing facilitates elimination of false accept rates without increasing occurrence of false rejection rate. Additionally, biohashing has highly clear separation of imposter populations and genuine, and zero equal error rate level. The proposed scheme also supports dynamic node addition and user friendly password change mechanism. Using the BAN-logic, we prove that the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication. In addition, we simulate proposed scheme for the security against man-in-the middle attack and replay attack using the AVISPA tool, and the simulation results show that our scheme is safe.

Due to the energy limitation of IoT devices, it is important to increase their energy efficiency. Further, when data from a very large number of IoT devices is individually transmitted, the data traffic volume can be significant. To resolve these issues, IoT devices and IoT GW can use sleep mode and data aggregation, respectively. However, when the IoT devices are in sleep mode for a long time and/or data are aggregated in IoT GW for a long time without any transmissions, data can become inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a consistency-guaranteed and energy efficient sleep scheduling algorithm (CG-E2S2) with data aggregation. In CG-E2S2, the optimal sleep duration of IoT devices and aggregation duration in IoT GW are jointly determined by means of a Markov decision process (MDP) with the consideration of energy efficiency of IoT devices, data traffic in networks, and data consistency. The evaluation results demonstrate that CG-E2S2 with the optimal policy outperforms the comparison schemes in terms of energy efficiency, data traffic volume, and data consistency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Data aggregation; Data consistency; Energy; Internet of things (IoT); Markov decision process (MDP); Sleep","Data acquisition; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Markov processes; Scheduling algorithms; Sleep research; Data aggregation; Data consistency; Energy; Internet of Things (IOT); Markov Decision Processes; Sleep; Internet of things","Pack, S.email: shpack@korea.ac.kr",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029724801

Many proposals focus on a Cloud-centric network architecture in which all the data collected from amyriad of sensors devices is transferred to the Cloud for processing. However, this approach presents significant limitations when faced with the formidable traffic generated by the Internet of Things and with the need for low-latency services. The deployment of IoT devices in compact groups, connected to the smart city network infrastructure by relatively powerful “gateways”, opens the possibility to depart from the centralized architectures and move the computation closer to the data sources. To this end, this paper proposes SPF, a new middleware solution that supports IoT application and service development, deployment, and management. SPF runs IoT services on capable devices located at the edge of the network and proposes a programming model that enables to take advantage of decentralized computation resources in a seamless fashion.

Especially, Denial of Service (DoS) attack becomes a serious problem on IoT system where huge number of devices are connected to. These devices are usually connected to IoT gateways in order to send packets to Internet. However, currently the impact of DoS attack on an IoT gateway, which has various interfaces such as wireless LAN interface and wired LAN interface, is not well examined. In this paper, we assess the impact of DoS attack on an IoT gateway with various scenarios. We implemented a prototype of an IoT gateway which has wired and wireless network interfaces by using Raspberry Pi, OpenWRT, and OVS (Open vSwitch). With this prototype, we evaluated various DoS attack scenarios on this IoT gateway.

Gateways are the bridge between the connected devices and the Internet, and their reliability is very important. According to literature, the reliability of electronic hardware components is closely related to their operating temperature. To avoid system performance loss under the thermal constraints, system designers rely on fans to cool the system. The problem is that the over cooling will produce noise and waste energy. In this paper, we propose Falcon, an ambient temperature aware thermal control policy for smart gateways. Falcon leverages a runtime thermal prediction model and takes the ambient temperature into the consideration to tune the fan speed proactively. Falcon can save 4.85% total system power and reduce noise in 34% of the time on average. In addition, the two environment adaption mechanisms applied in Falcon help us achieve the same thermal control ability in different ambient temperature environment, especially in high ambient temperature cases. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Noise reduction; Temperature-aware; Thermal control","Gateways (computer networks); Noise abatement; Temperature; Thermal variables control; Electronic hardwares; Internet of thing (IOT); Operating temperature; Temperature aware; Temperature environments; Thermal constraints; Thermal control; Thermal prediction; Internet of things","Li, Y.email: huizi@hdu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Inc.",22105379,,,,"English","Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028947459

These devices are endowed with the capacity to continuously sense the environment and collect data, which can be further transfered through gateway devices to the cloud. The generated data by IoT systems is often massive. Therefore, the communication gateways might become a bottleneck affecting the system performance due to their resources constraints. This is further exacerbated in the case of bandwidth limitation. The huge amount of data generated increases also the cost associated with data storage and processing at the cloud level. Edge computing, which is a recent IoT trend can contribute to addressing these issues by delegating data processing task to the edges (e.g. gateway devices). In this paper, we propose an approach, which aims at supporting the data processing and minimizes the size of the transferred data to the cloud side. To this end, our approach is based on the notion of rules used to filter the collected data. In order to support the principle of sharing and reusing the rules and the domain knowledge, we propose a Platform Independent Model (PIM) to specify this knowledge independently from the used platform (gateway node). In particular, we define a rule meta-model to support the creation of the model that captures the domain rules. Furthermore, we use Web semantic techniques to represent the knowledge at the semantic level. This representation facilitates the instantiation of these rules and domain knowledge to obtain the Platform Specific Model (PSM) at the gateway level to process and filter the data. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Internet of Things; Ontology; Platform independent model; Platform specific model; Semantic rules; Semantic web","Bandwidth; Data handling; Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); Ontology; Semantic Web; Systems analysis; Bandwidth limitation; Communication gateway; Domain knowledge; Heterogeneous devices; Internet of Things (IOT); Platform independent model; Platform specific model; Semantic rules; Internet of things","Bali, A.; Department of Software and IT Engineering, École de technologie supérieureCanada; email: ahmed.bali.1@ens.etsmtl.ca","Kovacs G.Csondes T.Rethy G.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319680149,,,"English","Lect.

One such application area is the water management systems for water supply and usage control. With the implementation of this standard in Contiki, no mechanism is present for control messages when other packets are being transmitted as well in the network. The gateway devices in these networks are usually exposed to more load in the network. During periods of high demand, packet dropping can occur at these nodes as well as other intermediate nodes that forward data. To address the high packet loss and congestion that takes place when the load level is high in a water telemetry management network, we propose a novel scheduling mechanism. This scheduling mechanism was implemented in the COOJA simulator using the Contiki operating system for wireless sensor nodes as an enhancement to carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The results show that with the application of the proposed cost function (CF) scheduling strategy, packet loss is reduced and throughput is improved in multi-hop networks over the default scheduling mechanism. This mechanism can also be implemented in other rapid growing Internet of Things (IoT) networks and can improve performance when carrying high loads. © 2017 The Authors.

The principal purpose of this global connection is to provide context awareness for the purpose of bringing convenience to a patient's life and more effectively implementing clinical processes. In health care, monitoring of biosignals of a patient has to be continuously performed while the patient moves inside and outside the hospital. Also, to monitor the accurate location and biosignals of the patient, appropriate mobility management is necessary to maintain connection between the patient and the hospital network. In this paper, a binding update scheme on PMIPv6, which reduces signal traffic during location updates by Virtual LMA (VLMA) on the top original Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) Domain, is proposed to reduce the total cost. If a Mobile Node (MN) moves to a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)-located boundary of an adjacent LMA domain, the MN changes itself into a virtual mode, and this movement will be assumed to be a part of the VLMA domain. In the proposed scheme, MAGs eliminate global binding updates for MNs between LMA domains and significantly reduce the packet loss and latency by eliminating the handoff between LMAs. In conclusion, the performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme improves performance significantly versus PMIPv6 and HMIPv6 in terms of the binding update rate per user and average handoff latency. © 2017 Cho et al.

Cloud computing is a computing paradigm currently adopted to process, store and provide access control to these data. This integration is called Cloud of Things - CoT and is useful in personal networks, like residential automation and health care, since it facilitates the access to the information. Although this integration brings benefits to the users, it introduces many security challenges since the information leaves the user control and is stored at the cloud providers. Particularly interesting, in order for these technologies to be adopted, it is important to provide protocols and mechanisms to preserve the users privacy when storing their data in the cloud. In this context, this paper proposes an architecture for privacy in Cloud of Things, which allows the users to fully control the access to the data generated by the devices of their IoT networks and stored in the cloud. The proposed architecture enables a fine grained control over data, since the privacy protocols and controls are executed at the IoT devices instead of at the network border by a gateway, which also could represent a single point of failure or a component that could impair the security properties of the system once it is compromised by a successful attack. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Due to the energy limitation of IoT devices, it is an important issue to increase energy efficiency of IoT devices. Meanwhile, when data from a huge number of IoT devices are individually transmitted, the data traffic volume can be significant. To resolve these issues, IoT devices and IoT GW can use sleep mode and data aggregation, respectively. However, when the IoT devices are in sleep mode for long time and/or data are aggregated in IoT GW for long time without any transmissions, the data can be inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a consistency-guaranteed and energy efficient sleep scheduling algorithm (CG-E2S2) with data aggregation. In CG-E2S2, the optimal sleep duration and the number of aggregated data are jointly determined by means of Markov decision process (MDP) with the consideration of energy efficiency of IoT devices, data traffic in networks, and data consistency.

The nodes also support over the air programming to re-configure the network from the cloud. As number of devices connected to the cloud increases, the network traffic also increases. In order to reduce the network traffic we have used different data transfer schemes for the network. We have also proposed an event-based data transfer scheme for situations where there is low probability of change in sensor value. The experimental results shows that the event-based scheme reduces the data traffic by up to 48% under practical conditions without any loss of information compared to priority based data transfer. We have also shown that the proposed scheme is more reliable for data transfer in a large network with a success rate of 99.5% measured over 200 minutes for 1201 data packets.","Data transfer scheme; Internet of Things; Network architecture; Wireless network","Data transfer; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Network architecture; Reconfigurable architectures; Wireless networks; Energy efficient; Generalized nodes; Internet of Things (IOT); Iot architectures; Low probability; Network traffic; Priority-based; Transfer scheme; Data reduction",,,"Kassel University Press GmbH",18681646,,,,"English","Int.

Such datasets are usually collected in real-time at the incident scenes using different Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hierarchical clouds, i.e., core and edge clouds, can help these applications' real-time data orchestration challenges as well as with their IoT operations scalability, reliability and stability by overcoming infrastructure limitations at the ad-hoc wireless network edge. Routing is a crucial infrastructure management orchestration mechanism for such systems. Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose. In this paper, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI)-augmented geographic routing approach, that relies on an area knowledge obtained from the satellite imagery (available at the edge cloud) by applying deep learning. In particular, we propose a stateless greedy forwarding that uses such an environment learning to proactively avoid the local minimum problem by diverting traffic with an algorithm that emulates electrostatic repulsive forces. In our theoretical analysis, we show that our Greedy Forwarding achieves in the worst case a 3.291 path stretch approximation bound with respect to the shortest path, without assuming presence of symmetrical links or unit disk graphs. We evaluate our approach with both numerical and event-driven simulations, and we establish the practicality of our approach in a real incident-supporting hierarchical cloud deployment to demonstrate improvement of application level throughput due to a reduced path stretch under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Electrostatics; Geographic routing; Incident-supporting applications; IoT; Local minimum avoidance","Ad hoc networks; Deep learning; Disasters; Electrostatics; Emergency services; Graph theory; Satellite imagery; Wireless ad hoc networks; Ad hoc wireless networks; Electrostatic repulsive forces; Event-driven simulations; Geographic routing; Infrastructure managements; Internet of Things (IOT); Local minimum avoidances; Reliability and stability; Internet of things","Chemodanov, D.email: dycbt4@mail.missouri.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028541738

The number of sensing devices is rapidly increasing along with the amount of sensing data. Consequently, a bottleneck problem at the local gateway has attracted high concern. An example scenario is smart elderly houses in rural areas where each house installs thousands of sensors and all connect to resource-limited and unstable 2G/3G networks. The bottleneck state can incur unacceptable latency and loss of significant data due to the limited waiting-queue. Orthogonally to the existing solutions, we propose a two-tier prioritization system to enhance information quality, indicated by VoI, at the local gateway. The proposed system has been designed to support several requirements with several conflicting criteria over shared sensing streams. Our approach adopts Multicriteria Decision Analysis technique to merge requirements and to assess the VoI. We introduce the framework that can reduce the computational cost by precalculation. Through a case study of building management systems, we have shown that our merge algorithm can provide 0.995 cosine-similarity for representing all user requirements and the evaluation approach can obtain satisfaction values around 3 times higher than the naïve strategies for the top-list data. © 2017 Sunyanan Choochotkaew et al.",,"Decision theory; Gateways (computer networks); Intelligent agents; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Bottleneck problem; Building management system; Computational costs; Evaluation approach; Information quality; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Prioritization systems; Smart applications; Information management","Choochotkaew, S.; Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka UniversityJapan; email: sunya-ch@ist.osaka-u.ac.jp",,"Hindawi Limited",1574017X,,,,"English","Mob.

The main goal is to study the volume of traffic in relatively large networks of sensor systems and Internet of Things considering fading and network connectivity. We also evaluate relevant parameters such as the mean CPU utilization and the mean queueing time in each node. The model is relatively general in that it combines the traffic from small devices such as sensors as well as more complex intermediate systems such as gateways and Internet nodes. It is also extensible to other types of scenarios and it allows the evaluation of the network under other performance criteria or evaluation metrics. The results show that the model yields simulation values that could be analytically validated by Jackson networks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Clustering; Connectivity; Emergency services; IoT; MANET; Network dimensioning; Traffic planning; VANET; WSN","Ad hoc networks; Discrete event simulation; Distributed computer systems; Emergency services; Internet of things; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Clustering; Connectivity; MANET; Network dimensioning; Traffic planning; VANET; Mobile ad hoc networks","Martins, P.S.; School of Technology, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), R.

So, the protocol used above the tcpie application layer protocol should be the light weight protocol and should have less overhead to cut back the processing burden on the embedded systems.

The performance is assessed in terms of service ratio, delay and activity factor of the transceivers. Results show that both technologies are suitable for the reference use case scenario. 802.11ah benefits from a higher throughput and lower delay jitter, whereas BLE sensors show lower activity factors and a longer battery lifetime is expected.

To this end, the paper proposes a solution, whose main component in the security between wireless sensors and the gateway is an Adaptive Security Manager (ASM), which can select the required level of security and inform the resource about it, based on the context.

This so-called Machine-Type Communication(MTC) cellular however is not a universal solution for IoT connectivity. It may be infeasible to equip some IoT devices with MTC cellular due to manufacturing cost, operation fee, limited battery lifetime, etc. For low-power IoT devices, using shorter range radios (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4) is more viable. Sensing data generated by the IoT devices are delivered to the IoT gateway by the forwarding of other nodes without relying on cellular links. Such peer-to-peer data delivery may utilize ’muling’ (i.e., data is stored and carried by mobile nodes) if the forwarding path may not be immediately available. Since muling will extend the delivery delay, it is suitable for the IoT applications that can tolerate relatively large message delivery delay. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) routing scheme for IoT network. To enhance routing efficiency, we utilize the location information of the nodes. Our scheme does not rely on expensive location tracking methods like GPS or triangulation. Instead, we use RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) which is readily available in virtually any wireless network at low cost. It is shown that the proposed scheme clearly outperforms the existing schemes via extensive simulations. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","DTN routing; Internet of things; Machine-type communication (MTC); Peer-to-peer data delivery; Signal strength","Cellular manufacturing; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Peer to peer networks; Standards; Wireless networks; Cellular technologies; Data delivery; DTN routing; Internet of Things (IOT); Machinetype communication (MTC); Message delivery delay; Received signal strength indicators; Signal strengths; Delay tolerant networks","Kim, S.-H.; Yonsei UniversitySouth Korea; email: molkey@yonsei.ac.kr",,"Springer New York LLC",19366442,,,,"English","Peer-to-Peer Netw.

By utilizing management gateways and controlling devices, this scheme can achieve dynamic connections and information communications among dummy Bluetooth devices by forming a centralized structure based on the Bluetooth protocol. Besides this, detailed procedures for concrete networking and management processes are also given in the paper and with the advantages of the proposed scheme analyzed. Furthermore, to validate the proposed scheme, a smart home environment is simulated with the aids of some embedded devices and mobile phones.

It is thus very important to effectively manage this huge amount of devices. Among many available device management protocols, Open Mobile Alliance Lightweight M2M (OMA LWM2M) has been adopted by the global M2M standards, ETSI M2M and oneM2M as the standard for device management. However, OMA LWM2M-supported devices are still not widely available because the standard is relatively recently published. On the other hand, there are millions of legacy devices and sensors that do not support the OMA LWM2M protocol. Consequently, how to integrate non-OMA LWM2M devices so that they can be managed by OMA LWM2M Server is urgently needed. Moreover, how to exercise OMA LWM2M device management from the M2M standards is also not well addressed by the standard. In this paper, we address both challenges by first designing an OMA LWM2M gateway between OMA LWM2M server and non-OMA LWM2M devices (legacy devices). Then we further integrate this gateway in the ETSI M2M and oneM2M-like standard architecture.

The Fog Computing paradigm essentially moves the compute nodes closer to sensing entities by exploiting peers and intermediary network devices. This reduces centralized communication with the cloud and entails increased coordination between sensing entities and (possibly available) smart network gateway devices. In this paper, we analyze the utility of offloading computation among peers when working in fog based deployments. It is important to study the trade-offs involved with such computation offloading, as we deal with resource (energy, computation capacity) limited devices. Devices computing in a distributed environment may choose to locally compute part of their data and communicate the remainder to their peers. An optimization formulation is presented that is applied to various deployment scenarios, taking the computation and communication overheads into account. Our technique is demonstrated on a network of robotic sensor-actuators developed on the ROS (Robot Operating System) platform, that coordinate over the fog to complete a task.

It is predicted that more and more sensor devices and computing resources will be deployed in access networks because of the Internet of Things (IoT). This movement can create a wide variety of new applications with different requirements of delay, privacy and locality. Smart community dictates less than 10ms communication as a control interval in order not to disturb the lifeline systems, such as power supply. As such, future devices should have the following attributes: low-power, low-latency, and flexibility for various applications. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware, low-latency, and flexible local device, such as gateway or coordinator, which integrates an SoC FPGA with dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) feature to grapple with data anonymization. The data anonymization is important to protect private information in smart community because domestic human activities can be, for example, estimated by exploiting electric power consumption data, which is known as nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM). However, anonymization operations usually require processing cost at the order of O(n2) where n denotes the number of data in a privacy processing window. In case of encapsulating privacy information in a local network, privacy preserving computation should be achieved in a local device. Hence, we have implemented four primitive operations using DPR for various anonymization purposes.

Thus, the relevant energy efficiency issues have recently been attracting much attention from both academia and industry. In this article we adopt an energy-efficient architecture for Industrial IoT (IIoT), which consists of a sense entities domain, RESTful service hosted networks, a cloud server, and user applications. Under this architecture, we focus on the sense entities domain where huge amounts of energy are consumed by a tremendous number of nodes. The proposed framework includes three layers: the sense layer, the gateway layer, and the control layer. This hierarchical framework balances the traffic load and enables a longer lifetimeof the whole system. Based on this deployment, a sleep scheduling and wake-up protocol is designed, supporting the prediction of sleep intervals. The shifts of states support the use of the entire system resources in an energy-efficient way.

Aggregation logic is typically programmed in the C language and embedded into the firmware. However, developing aggregation programs is difficult for M2M service providers because it requires gatewayspecific knowledge and consideration of resource issues, especially RAM usage. In addition, modification of aggregation logic requires the application of firmware updates, which are risky. We propose a rule-based sensor data aggregation system, called the complex sensor data aggregator (CSDA), for M2M gateways. The functions comprising the data aggregation process are subdivided into the categories of filtering, statistical calculation, and concatenation. The proposed CSDA supports this aggregation process in three steps: the input, periodic data processing, and output steps. The behaviors of these steps are configured by an XML-based rule. The rule is stored in the data area of flash ROM and is updatable through the Internet without the need for a firmware update. In addition, in order to keep within the memory limit specified by the M2M gateway's manufacturer, the number of threads and the size of the working memory are static after startup, and the size of the working memory can be adjusted by configuring the sampling setting of a buffer for sensor data input. The proposed system is evaluated in an M2M gateway experimental environment. Results show that developing CSDA configurations is much easier than using C because the configuration decreases by 10%. In addition, the performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed system's ability to operate on M2M gateways. © Copyright 2016 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","In memory processing; IoT (the Internet of Things); M2M gateway; Sensor data aggregation","C (programming language); Computer circuits; Data handling; Firmware; Internet of things; Random access storage; Aggregation process; Communication cost; Experimental environment; IoT (the Internet of Things); Machine-to-machine (M2M); Number of threads; Sensor data aggregation; Statistical calculations; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Maruzen Co., Ltd.",09168532,,ITISE,,"English","IEICE Trans Inf Syst",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84999074919

This communication can be achieved by installing certain add-ons in the client and server sides. Methods: In the existing methods, the communication between the end clients using CoAP protocol is a difficult task. In the proposed architecture, the main task is to achieve the communication between the end clients without gateways or intermediate proxies. In this method, the ports used for the HTTP (8000) and CoAP (5683) protocols are to be opened simultaneously for achieving communication. With the help of this protocol, the end clients can be connected over the internet. Findings: CoAP uses Universal Datagram Packets (UDP) since it uses its own DTLS security for the embedded devices. The system makes use of the Web IOPi and the txThings, a framework to communicate with the CoAP. Applications: In this work, txThings and WebIOPi are used in the Raspberry Pi and add-ons are installed along with the txThings and WebIOPi in the Web Browser using the command line interface.

We consider a specific type of LPWA network (see LoRaWAN [2] for an example) where uplink packets sent from end devices are received by multiple intermediate gateways and forwarded to a network server. In the downlink direction, network server selects a gateway to send downlink packet(s) to a given device. We consider a scenario where uplink LPWA packets are aggregated at gateways using LTE networks. As multiple LPWA gateways receive copies of same uplink packet from an IoT device, these multiple copies (of same packet) are sent over the LTE network resulting in inefficient utilization of LTE network resources. It is not desirable especially when large number of IoT devices are deployed in an area or when some of these end devices start communicating lot more data on detection of some events. Also, if the network server selects a gateway for downlink traffic without having good information about intermediate LTE network elements, it could result in choosing a gateway that does not provide a good end-To-end path from network server to end device. We propose a traffic management framework that helps to reduce load in the LTE networks in uplink direction and help select a suitable LTE eNodeB and a gateway for downlink traffic in these LTE-LPWA networks.

Devices such as the Jetson TX1 and TK1 incorporate an ARM multicore plus General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GP-GPU) capability to enhance performance for data-parallel computations. We demonstrate the value of this type of hybrid architecture on an example IoT system test bed while achieving non-trivial speedup. This points clearly to the need for gateway devices to move to highly parallel architectures, rather than simply serving as small servers with multiple network adapters. © 2016 IEEE.","Internet of Things; Parallel Computation; Scalability","Computer circuits; Gateways (computer networks); Network architecture; Parallel architectures; Scalability; Data parallel; Gateway devices; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); Hybrid architectures; Internet of thing (IOT); Multiple networks; Parallel Computation; Scalable architectures; Internet of things","Canedo, J.; Samuel Ginn College of Engineering, Auburn UniversityUnited States; email: janice.canedo@auburn.edu",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035250,,,"English","IEEE High Perform.

As a particular segment of IoT, the smart home gateways, also named Machine-Type Communication Gateway (MTCG), become an important direction for industry including telecommunication operators. In most cases, the MTCG acts as a bridge between connected smart objects and the public network (Internet). As a consequence of the IoT domain expansion, the separate configuration of each individual Machineto- Machine (M2M) device is not feasible anymore due to steadily growing numbers of M2M nodes. To perform this task, several novel technologies have recently been introduced. However, legacy protocols and mechanisms for remote network management still retain a certain application potential for IoT. Accordingly, we have investigated the well-known protocol TR-069 with a particular focus on its usability for MTCG. To this end, the software module (bundle) based on the TR-069 for remote configuration and management of MTCG, as well as for controlling the end smart devices, has been developed. We believe that our implementation (available as open source on GitHub) can serve as an important building block for efficient management of future IoT devices. Therefore, TR-069 protocol constitutes a proven and standardized technology and could be easily deployed by most of the network and service providers today. © 2016 IEEE.","IoT; M2M; MTCG; OSGI; Remote management; TR-069","Automation; Data communication systems; Gateways (computer networks); Intelligent buildings; Internet protocols; Open source software; Remote control; Signal processing; Telecommunication industry; Configuration and managements; Machine type communications; Machine-to-machine (M2M); MTCG; OSGI; Remote management; Telecommunication operators; TR-069; Internet of things",,"Herencsar N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012886,,,"English","Int.

It is fully adapted to the simple yet robust communication needs of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors. However, its error-free operation with maximum data rate requires a careful and judicious setting of PIC data packet and pulse timing parameters. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for automatically detecting and setting the PIC protocol parameters at the power-on phase while removing the restriction on the IoT devices in the PIC network to communicate at a baud rate. The hardware realization of the algorithm is power-efficient and uses closed-form formulas that assign suitable protocol parameters to both ends of the transmission link based on clock rate differences. This difference is determined by a preliminary exchange of clock pulse streams between the transmitter and the receiver. The automatic parameter setting remains operational even in the presence of variations between the local clock frequencies of the IoT devices communicating via PIC. The algorithm is illustrated in the case of several IoT devices with different local clock frequencies that are in need to synchronize their communication parameters with respect to the clock frequency of a master gateway node. A power-on PIC parameter configuration process is rigorously specified, and both an FPGA and an ASIC implementations are presented. In particular, we show that for an ASIC implementation in 65nm technology, the low-power operation of PIC is maintained, consuming only 4.35μW of power at a clock frequency of 25MHz. This architecture is experimentally verified and tested on a point-to-point communication link between two IoT devices connected via a single PIC channel in a master-slave mode. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Clocks; Gateways (computer networks); LSI circuits; Parameter estimation; Photonic integration technology; VLSI circuits; Clock and data recovery; Communication parameters; Configuration process; Error free operations; Internet of Things (IOT); Point-to-point communication; Protocol configurations; Robust communication; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509035618,,,"English","IFIP/IEEE Int.

Current art in IoT architectures utilizes gateways to enable application-specific connectivity to IoT devices. In typical configurations, an IoT gateway is shared among several IoT devices. However, given the limited available bandwidth and processing capabilities of an IoT gateway, the quality of service (QoS) of IoT devices must be adjusted over time not only to fulfill the needs of individual IoT device users, but also to tolerate the QoS needs of the other IoT devices sharing the same gateway. In this paper, we address the problem of QoS management for IoT devices under bandwidth, battery, and processing constraints. We first formulate the problem of resource-aware QoS tailored to the IoT paradigm and then propose an efficient problem decomposition that enables the adoption of a recurrent dynamic programming approach with reduced execution time overhead. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach with a case study and through extensive experimentation over different IoT system configurations regarding to the number and type of the employed IoT-devices.

Sensor deployments often tend towards low-power communication protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or IEEE 802.15.4. Gateways are essential to connect these devices to the Internet at large. Over time though, gateways have gained additional responsibilities as well. Sensors expect gateways to handle device-specific data translation and local processing while also providing services, such as time synchronization, to the low-power device. As a centralized computing resource, the gateway is also an obvious location for running local applications which interact with sensor data and control nearby actuators. Today, vendors and researchers often create their own device-specific gateways to handle these responsibilities. We propose a generic gateway platform capable of supporting the needs of many devices. In our architecture, devices provide a pointer, such as a URL, to descriptions of their interfaces. The gateway can download the interface descriptions and use them to determine how to interact with the device, translating its data to a usable format and enabling local services to communicate with it. The translated data is provided to services including user applications, local logging, device status monitoring, and cloud applications. By simultaneously supporting communication with many sensors, our gateway architecture can simplify future sensor network deployments and enable intelligent building applications.",,"Energy efficiency; Intelligent buildings; Network architecture; Sensor networks; Standards; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Building applications; Computing resource; Gateway architecture; Interface descriptions; Low-power communication; Network deployment; Time synchronization; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450342643,,,"English","Proc.

For efficiency and management reasons, it might be desirable to avoid public-key-based solutions that are ubiquitous in traditional Internet settings but have many drawbacks for resource-constrained (RC) nodes. We introduce a novel Vicinity-based Pairing (VP) mechanism that allows authenticating arbitrary ‘unloaded’ RC-nodes by delegating trust from already authenticated and secured, we call it ‘loaded’, RC-nodes. For authenticating RC-nodes, VP exploits the correlation between channel profiles from devices that are in close physical proximity. In our setting, only devices that are within a few centimetres from the ‘loaded’ RC-nodes are authenticated after a user initiates such a process. Subsequently, the embedded end device can extract an unique shared symmetric key with another device such as a SCADA gateway, again by exploiting channel parameters. Based on extensive experiments, we propose new techniques for extracting time-varying randomness from channel parameters for use in VP. We describe the first MITM-resistant device pairing protocol purely based on a single wireless interface with an extensive adversarial model and protocol analysis. We show that existing wireless devices can be retro-fitted with the VP protocol via software updates, i.e. without changes to the hardware. Implementation results of our embedded prototype demonstrates that the approach has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost and efforts of securing low-resource devices that are common in the IoT. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Authenticated key agreement over wireless channels; Embedded implementation; Experimental results; Proximity-based pairing","Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Public key cryptography; Reconfigurable hardware; Authenticated key establishments; Embedded implementation; Experimental results; Low resource devices; Physical proximity; Proximity-based pairing; Wireless channel; Wireless interfaces; Authentication","Zenger, C.T.; PHYSEC GmbH, Universitätsstr. 150, 44801 Bochum, Germany; email: christian.zenger@physec.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",13891286,,CNETD,,"English","Comput.

Visible Light Communication (VLC) based on Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) is an attractive communication fabric for the IoT, as LEDs are readily available and can serve as transmitters as well as receivers. LED light bulbs, enhanced with photodiodes, provide an attractive path to extend device-to-device communication to room area networking. This paper describes a VLC system, called EnLighting, based on light bulbs that support an embedded Linux version (and its complete networking stack). These programmable light bulbs can both send and receive; they can communicate with objects in a room as well as with other light bulbs nearby. Bidirectional communication allows a light bulb to actively participate in networking and simplifies deployment, maintenance, configuration, and controllability of indoor lighting installations and services. EnLighting supports low-bandwidth communication services in a room (and via a gateway, beyond the room), which provide the base for other applications, e.g., a location service. This paper includes an initial evaluation of a room area communication and localization network based on prototype Linux-enabled light bulbs, reporting the performance for different network traffic types, and shows the benefits obtained from bidirectional communication.

IoT architecture ensures that devices are connected to each other and able to communicate as and when required. Centre for the Development of Telematics (C-DoT) developed Tower Monitoring Solution (TMS) [1] which monitors status of different sources of power in Telecom Towers. Standard oneM2M is one of the standards of IoT that defines the architecture of connected devices. TMS is now being updated according to oneM2M standard since C-DoT is part of Telecommunications Standards Development Society, India (TSDSI) which is involved in development of oneM2M standard. Under this new architecture, bidirectional connection is required to send data and alarm notification from centralized server/gateway to TMS devices. However, in GSM-GPRS SIM based devices, IP address of the device changes every time they are connected to the network, so the server is not aware of the current device IP address and cannot send data to the device. Also, in our oneM2M network, devices of different capabilities are connected, so a single approach does not work for all the devices. In this paper we have discussed about different methods which can be used by GSM-GPRS devices & devices of different capabilities to establish two way communication with centralized server. In this paper we have proposed an algorithm based solution for this challenge.

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS.

In order to provide reliable interoperation, we proposed a standard DDS-based ‘Adaptor’ for the ZigBee network. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

In CoAP, to support the handover of mobile devices, service discovery should be performed again. So, the handover delay may be increased significantly. To address this limitation of CoAP, in this letter, we propose the two mobility management schemes based on the proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6): CoAP-PMIP and CoAP-DPMIP. In CoAP-PMIP, local mobility anchor (LMA) and mobile access gateways (MAGs) are used to provide network-based mobility support for sensor devices. Each device has to register its IPv6 address with LMA, and all messages are transmitted through LMA. In CoAP-DPMIP, the role of LMA is distributed to each MAG. By using distributed MAGs, this scheme can provide optimized transmission path and also reduce the handover delay. From ns-3 simulations, we can see that the CoAP-DPMIP scheme provides better performance than the CoAP and CoAP-PMIP schemes, in terms of total delay associated with binding update, data transmission, and handover. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","CoAP; handover; internet of things; mobile sensor devices; Mobility management; PMIPv6","Internet of things; Mobile telecommunication systems; Remote control; CoAP; Handover; Mobile sensors; Mobility management; PMIPv6; Internet protocols",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10897798,,ICLEF,,"English","IEEE Commun Lett",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996844977

As technologies of sensor networks and the IoT (Internet of Things) made strides, systems that monitor traffic violations have become automated, which led to increase in the amounts of data generated, and as such overheads may occur. Also, given encryption is used to prevent leakage of information on vehicles, in order to track a specific vehicle, data on the vehicle must be provided to the secondary user. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a model based on Attribute-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (ABPRE). The proposed system collects data from a place (edge) close to the sensor (device), and performs pre-processing or real-time processing on the data, or processes the data using a smart gateway that processes only sensor data. Such processing is done by the proxy of ABPRE, and the system is designed so that among the secondary users, only those with the specific privileges can decrypt the ciphertext. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

Applications from Internet querying for Spatio-temporal information within WSN may require query decomposition. Decomposition of queries may result in tasks having similar functional and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Thus pre-processing the tasks results in decreased number of task executions within WSN as compared to executing tasks individually. Moreover prior knowledge of sensor nodes’ residual energy can help in deciding if a task can be scheduled for its successful completion. Existing energy monitoring protocols in WSNs incur considerable amount of message traffic and energy. Thus an Energy Monitoring System (EMS) that works on reduced message traffic and yet provide the correct energy information will be of great value. This paper proposes Task Requirements Aware Pre-processing and Scheduling (TRAPS) mechanism comprising a task pre-processor, EMS and scheduler within the gateway. The scheduler allocates the best available sensor nodes to the incoming tasks while meeting their QoS requirement. Task pre-processor and EMS are tested individually to measure the key performance metrics that include number of tasks entering WSN and energy information prediction accuracy respectively. Further the performance evaluation of TRAPS is extended to study its effects on various network parameters. It is found that TRAPS outperforms the findings of recent research on task scheduling in IoT sensory environments in terms of the identified network performance metrics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Internet-of-Things; Quality of service; Task allocation; Wireless sensor networks","Energy management systems; Internet; Internet of things; Quality of service; Reconfigurable hardware; Scheduling; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication services; Wireless sensor networks; Energy monitoring system; Internet of Things (IOT); Network performance metrics; Prediction accuracy; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Spatiotemporal information; Task allocation; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Gateways (computer networks)","Bharti, S.; Wireless Sensor Networks Laboratory, ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India; email: bharti.sourabh90@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979599477

Meeting such requests using today's approaches is a time-consuming processsince such end-To-end slices need to be hardwired together due to the lackof information-centric frameworks to aggregate and control diverse types ofresources from IoT, network functions and cloud infrastructures.

The system collected real-time environmental information such as soil moisture, air temperature and humidity, light intensity, wind speed and rainfall of litchi orchard through information collecting terminal modules then transmitted data packets of environmental information to gateway through wireless sensor network. The data packets would be processed and then transmitted to the cloud server through the GPRS network by the gateway. Combined with the environmental data and expert knowledge, the expert-decision system would establish multiple mathematical models of decision to achieve some decision-making functions such as the crop water requirements computing, irrigation time prediction, optimum quantitative irrigation decision-making and irrigation scheduling. The decision results were fed back to the control terminal module for intelligent controlling. The system was tested at the litchi orchard of College of Horticulture in South China Agricultural University from Feb. 11th, 2016 to Mar. 15th, 2016. In the test of the monitoring accuracy of information collecting terminal module, the results obtained from TES-1317 resistance thermometer, DT-8896 wet and dry bulb hygrometer, AR813A light illumination measuring instrument and so on were compared with those obtained information collecting terminal module. The results revealed the maximum relative error of the temperature 2.98%, that of the humidity 3.06%, that of the illumination was 6.25%, that of soil moisture 4.13%, that of wind speed 4.76% and precipitation 2.25%. It indicated that the monitoring accuracy of information collecting terminal module was high and was able to provide precise decision-making data for expert decision system. The decision-making system with multi-parameter and single parameter was tested to measure the accuracy of the expert decision system and determine the accuracy of the system according to the comparison between drought condition and actual situation. The result showed that the accuracy of multi-parameter decision was higher than the simple single parameter decision. The system gained the number of days automatically during the tests of the decision-making instantaneity of the system. When the soil water content was lower than the minimum of the litchi optimum water content which was 15.55%, the system opened the solenoid valve and began to do drip irrigation. On the other hand, the system stopped doing drip irrigation when the soil water content was higher than 19.14%. The result showed that the average soil water content of irrigation area was 17.4%, satisfying the requirement of the soil water content in the growth process of litchi trees, which illustrated that the irrigation decision made by system had strong real-time. The result from subtracting the days interval for predicting irrigation of the system by the days when the soil water content was below the minimum from the system began to irrigate showed that the system prediction accuracy could reach 75%, which illustrated that the predicting real-time of the system was better.

Devices in IoT applications such as smart healthcare applications deal with sensitive data of our health and daily lives and thus can execute malicious actuating commands with serious safety consequences. Therefore, it is important to ensure secure communication channel establishment among the medical sensors or devices and the remote servers. In this work, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and suitable to protect sensitive health related data in the context of IoT. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic functions of resource-constrained sensors to the trustful neighboring sensors. This trust verification is ensured by finding the data correlations from the data of embedded accelerometers in the smartphone acting as gateway and the sensors installed on the body.

Current art in IoT architectures utilizes gateways to enable application-specific connectivity to IoT devices. In typical configurations, an IoT gateway is shared among several IoT devices. However, given the limited available bandwidth and processing capabilities of an IoT gateway, the quality of service (QoS) of IoT devices must be adjusted over time not only to fulfill the needs of individual IoT device users, but also to tolerate the QoS needs of the other IoT devices sharing the same gateway. In this paper, we address the problem of QoS management for IoT devices under bandwidth, battery, and processing constraints. We first formulate the problem of resourceaware QoS tailored to the IoT paradigm and then propose an efficient problem decomposition that enables the adoption of a recurrent dynamic programming approach with reduced execution time overhead. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach with a case study and through extensive experimentation over different IoT system configurations regarding to the number and type of the employed IoTdevices.

To support the interconnection and interoperability between heterogeneous IoT systems, the availability of standardized, open application programming interfaces (APIs) is one of the key features of common software platforms for IoT devices, gateways, and servers. In this paper, we present a standardized way of extending previously-existing WSNs towards IoT systems, building the world of the Web of Things (WoT). Based on the oneM2M software platforms developed in the previous project, we introduce a well-designed open API scheme and device-specific thing adaptation software (TAS) enabling WSN elements, such as a wireless sensor node, to be accessed in a standardized way on a global scale. Three pilot services are implemented (i.e., a WiFi-enabled smart flowerpot, voice-based control for ZigBee-connected home appliances, and WiFi-connected AR.Drone control) to demonstrate the practical usability of the open API scheme and TAS modules. Full details on the method of integrating WSN elements into three example systems are described at the programming code level, which is expected to help future researchers in integrating their WSN systems in IoT platforms, such as oneM2M. We hope that the flexibly-deployable, easily-reusable common open API scheme and TAS-based integration method working with the oneM2M platforms will help the conventional WSNs in diverse industries evolve into the emerging WoT solutions. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Internet of things; OneM2M; Open API; Web of things; Wireless sensor network","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer software reusability; Computer systems programming; Domestic appliances; Internet; Interoperability; Sensor nodes; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless sensor networks; World Wide Web; Zigbee; Integration method; Internet of thing (IOT); Network technologies; OneM2M; Open API; Open application programming interface; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor node; Internet of things","Yun, J.; Dept of Internet of Things, SCH Media Labs, Soonchunhyang UniversitySouth Korea; email: yun@sch.ac.kr",,"MDPI AG",14248220,,,,"English","Sensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990947064

Sigfox and LoRA are two protocols that provide low-power wireless access for IoT devices. The company Sigfox is building a network that it will operate to provide low-bitrate communications of less than 1kbit/s between sensor and gateway. This allows very low power operation but, due to the low data rate, software updates will need to be deployed using a second wireless connection or be performed by hand. LoRA is bidirectional with a datarate of up to 10kbit/s using a spread-spectrum signal that makes it possible for networks built by different operators to overlap. The first option for an LTE-based IoT cellular protocol is Cat-M, which is optimised for applications that demand a higher datarate than the other IoT-focused protocols. Cat-M supports 1Mbit/s datarates for both the uplink and downlink using half-duplex communication. Although it is based on LTE, the Cat-M protocol employs a simpler transmission scheme that roughly halves modem complexity compared to the LTE implementation required for a cellular handset. A key advantage of the cellular protocols is their relative openness, particularly for device makers and integrators. The Narrowband-IoT protocol uses a smaller transmission bandwidth compared to conventional LTE: 200KHz versus 20MHz for Cat-0 and 1.4MHz for Cat-M. The protocols can be incorporated into custom silicon, which can greatly reduce the cost of manufacture for medium- and high-volume sensor nodes.",,"Complex networks; Gateways (computer networks); Low power electronics; Sensor nodes; Telephone sets; Transmissions; Wide area networks; Cellular protocols; Half-duplex communication; Low power wireless; Low-power operation; Spread spectrum signals; Transmission bandwidth; Transmission schemes; Wireless connection; Internet of things","Gresset, E.; Wireless Business Unit, CEVAUnited States",,"Omeda",15233081,,,,"English","ECN Electron.

This attempt is based on a communication gateway and a cloud-based system, that hosts all algorithms and models to calculate a prediction of the tool wear. As an example we will show the Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding (RFSSW), a solid state joining technique, which is examined at the Institute of Production Engineering (LaFT) of the Helmut-Schmidt-University, University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, for years. RFSSW is a sub-section of friction welding, where a rotating tool that consists out of three parts is used to heat up material to a dough-like state. Since Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding produces a selective dot-shaped connection of overlapping materials, the production requirements are similar to riveting or resistance spot welding. In contrast to other bonding techniques, Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding can be integrated within the production process without major interferences or changes. At the LaFT we build a prototype from which we collected a big amount of data which we are now trying to analyze with methods that are known from the Industrie 4.0. For the Industry 4.0 idea, the production environment respectively the welding equipment acts like an Internet of things device, that publishes its data to the cloud and retrieves a calculated result.

The Internet of things (IOT) is the network of computed physical objects which enables these things to connect, collect and exchange data. In this paper, we propose an earthquake early warning system by means of an IOT in WSN. The sensors are placed in the surface of the earth. When an earthquake occurs, both compression P wave and transverse S wave radiates outward the epicenter of the earth. The P wave, which travels fastest, trips the sensors, placed in the landscape. It causes early alert signals to be transfer ahead, giving humans and automated electronic system a warning to take precautionary actions. So that before the damage begins with the arrival of the slower but stronger S waves, the public are warned earlier. The signal from each sensor which senses the P wave and which has Zigbee transmitter transfers the alert signal to the gateway. The gateway which has the Zigbee receiver and acts as an IOT transfers the warning to smart phones. Thus early alert message is received by the people in terms of location, time and other parameters. Eventually, many of the human lives can be saved. The software used here is LABVIEW where the three angle axis of the sensor can be sensed and detected when the sensors are interfaced with this software. © 2016 IEEE.","Earthquake; IOT; Warning signal; Wireless Sensor Network; ZIGBEE","Computer programming languages; Earthquakes; Gateways (computer networks); Geophysics; Internet of things; Reconfigurable hardware; Seismic waves; Shear waves; Signal processing; Smartphones; Wireless telecommunication systems; Zigbee; Early alerts; Earthquake early warning systems; Electronic systems; Environmental conditions; Internet of thing (IOT); Physical objects; Spatially distributed sensors; Warning signals; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Presses Polytechniques Et Universitaires Romandes",,9781467393379,,,"English","Proc.

Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are now becoming mainstream data source for IoT applications by connecting to uniquely addressable and routable gateways. Wireless Sensor Networks are defined as a collection of devices with limited resources like processing, memory, power and bandwidth, deployed for sensing various scalar and multimedia data with diverse traffic types. These data are critical and has to reach the sink in time. The constrained nature of the network with inherent approach of best effort data delivery, not only imposes challenges in reliable transmission of data but also the real time delivery of the data. With increasing use of IoT technology in Smart solutions such as Access control, Real time inventory, Flow optimization, one of the key problems of next generation WSNs is the real-time management and control of network paths within the sensor network so that mission critical data from sensor nodes reaches the IoT Gateway in real-time. In addition, given the myriad type of applications in WSN, imposes the need to segregate and treat data traffic variedly based on the criticality of the application and/or data. Hence there is a need to address the aspects of optimal usage of resources for handling delivery of critical data satisfying its Quality of Service (QoS) requirements within the sensor network.

In traditional cloud computing model, the end-users are knowledgeable about the Virtual Machines (VMs) and are technically aware of their requirements in terms of the computing cores, processing abilities, and storage requirements. In case of IoT, the users are envisioned to be widespread from naive, unsophisticated people to even objects or things who are devoid of the required knowledge and expertise. Further, in IoT technology, multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) may possess the potential of serving an IoT application. Therefore, it is required for the end-user to judiciously select a single CSP based on the maximum obtainable Quality of Service (QoS) from a CSP. This work proposes an algorithm QoS based Automated Selection of CSP (QASeC) for automated selection of a CSP from a set of nominated CSPs based on the maximum achievable QoS.

A micro-hydropower generator supplies power to a CO sensor without battery (COSWOB) (2.5Wat a flow rate of 4.2 L/min), and the power consumption of the COSWOB is only ~13 mW. The COSWOB monitors the CO concentration in ambient conditions around natural gas water heaters and transmits it to an intelligent gateway. When the CO level reaches a dangerous level, the COSWOB alarm sounds loudly. Meanwhile, the intelligent gateway also sends a trigger to activate Wi-Fi alarms and sends notifications to the mobile device through the Internet. Our strategy can warn people indoors and outdoors, thereby reducing CO poisoning accidents.

Resources are named through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) at the application layer and typically reachable at the network layer through IP connectivity. Such an approach can be used also to access extremely resource-constrained devices, provided that lightweight interactions with a gateway, remotely exposing their resources, are granted. Among potential alternatives to support communication between the gateway and such constrained devices, we investigate the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, gaining momentum in the future Internet research arena. It differs from the host-centric IP networking in that it cares for the content to retrieve instead of the device hosting it. By directly using content names at the network layer and a receiver-driven communication, ICN well fits the requirements of many machine-to-machine (M2M) applications that are information-centric in nature and rely on a publish-subscribe service model. In this paper, we propose an ICN-based solution to be deployed on top of constrained devices whose named resources are exposed at a wide area scope by an M2M gateway. The proposal aims at ensuring easy interoperability with ETSI M2M specifications, thus allowing remote applications to access the resources of ICN-enabled nodes. To showcase the viability of our proposal, a test-bed has been deployed leveraging low-cost devices for home automation.

Simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol outperforms the conventional CSMA and other popular MAC schemes, in terms of energy consumption, delay, and packet delivery ratio (PDR). © 2016 IEEE.","Cluster; Energy efficiency; Internet of Things (IoT); Machine-To-Machine (M2M); Medium access control (MAC); Multi-hop; Time-division multiple access (TDMA)","Access control; Carrier communication; Carrier sense multiple access; Complex networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Medium access control; Reconfigurable hardware; Trees (mathematics); Wireless telecommunication systems; Cluster; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine-to-machine (M2M); Medium access control(MAC); Multihop; Time division multiple accesses (TDMA); Time division multiple access","Kim, S.; Virginia TechUnited States; email: seungmo@vt.edu",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467386661,,,"English","IEEE Wirel.

The design is evaluated using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. IoT network consists of four layers. The first layer represents IoT objects and the three other layers host relays, the coordinator and the gateway, respectively. PON consists of two layers hosting the Optical Network Units (ONUs) and the Optical Line Terminal (OLT), respectively. Equipment at all layers, except the object layer, can aggregate and process the traffic generated by IoT objects. The processing is performed using distributed mini clouds that host different types of Virtual Machines (VMs). These mini clouds can be located at the three upper layers of the IoT network and the PON two layers. We aim to reduce the total power consumption resulting from the traffic delivery and data processing at the different layers. The energy efficiency can be achieved by optimizing the placement and number of the mini clouds and VMs and utilizing energy efficient routes. Our results indicate that up to 21% of total power can be saved utilizing energy efficient PONs and serving heterogeneous VMs. © 2016 IEEE.","access network; cloud computing; energy efficiency; IoT; PON; virtualization","Cloud computing; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Integer programming; Internet of things; Passive networks; Transparent optical networks; Virtual reality; Access network; Cloud computing platforms; Internet of Things (IOT); Mixed integer linear programming model; Optical access networks; Optical line terminals; Total power consumption; Virtualizations; Passive optical networks",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21627339,9781509014675,,,"English","Int.

In this IoT environment, because mobile devices serve as a gateway for all personalized services, their protection plays a crucial role in the creation of a secure IoT environment. In the case of Android, the classic mobile platform, security is at risk from repackaging attacks because of structural weaknesses in the platform. To prevent such repackaging attacks, Android-based applications currently utilize various obfuscation techniques and insert tamper detection methods. However, it is possible to easily bypass even these measures. Thus, in this paper we propose an anti-reverse-engineering dynamic tamper detection scheme that applies image steganography to distribute and hide code in PNG image files.

Today, several approaches exist to facilitate communication of sensors and actuators in IoT applications. Most communications go through often proprietary gateways requiring availability of the gateway for each and every interaction between sensors and actuators. Sometimes, the gateway does some processing of the sensor data before triggering actuators. Other approaches put this processing logic further in the cloud. These approaches introduce significant latencies and increased number of packets. In this paper, we introduce a CoAP-based mechanism for direct binding of sensors and actuators. This flexible binding solution is utilized further to build IoT applications through RESTlets. RESTlets are defined to accept inputs and produce outputs after performing some processing tasks. Sensors and actuators could be associated with RESTlets (which can be hosted on any device) through the flexible binding mechanism we introduced. This approach facilitates decentralized IoT application development by placing all or part of the processing logic in Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). We run several tests to compare the performance of our solution with existing solutions and found out that our solution reduces communication delay and number of packets in the LLN. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","CoAP; In-network processing; Internet of things; IoT application; Resource observation; RESTlets; Sensor/actuator binding","Actuators; Bins; Computer circuits; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Low power electronics; Reconfigurable hardware; CoAP; In-network processing; IOT applications; Resource observation; RESTlets; Sensor/actuator; Internet of things","Teklemariam, G.K.; Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University—iMinds, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 15, Belgium; email: girum.ketema@intec.ugent.be",,"MDPI AG",14248220,,,,"English","Sensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982703155

IPAs are software agents used to support users to fulfill several daily actions. They are supposed to be intelligent in such a way that allows them to give their owners advices about many different subjects. To do so, IPAs must learn about their user behavior and routines. With the current state of the art technologies, scenarios of ubiquitous communication can be created. One of the potential enablers for those scenarios is the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm where machines with decision support systems interact and communicate among them. In an IoT environment, IPAs can interact with other smart objects in order to gain new knowledge and awareness about their users. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based mobile gateway solution for mobile health (m-Health) scenarios. This gateway autonomously collects information about the user/patient location, heart rate, and possible fall detection. Moreover, it forwards the collected information to a caretaker IPA, in real time, that will manage a set of actions and alarms appropriately.

With the explosion of connected devices, it is essential for conversion gateway between the Internet and sensor nodes to support end-to-end (e2e) interoperability because the current Internet Protocol (IT) does not support end-to-end delay in IEEE 802.15.4e. As part of IoT, we propose a scheduling scheme of multiple channels and multiple timeslots to minimize the e2e delay in multi-hop environments. The proposed greedy heuristic approach is compared with the meta-heuristics in terms of the given end-to-end delay bound. Although the meta-heuristics is more accurate in finding a global optimum or sub-optimal values than the greedy heuristic approach, this advantage comes at the expense of high complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the complexity by obtaining suboptimal solutions that satisfy the e2e delay requirement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","End-to-end delay; Multi-channel; Multi-hop; Multi-timeslot; Scheduling algorithms; Wireless sensor networks","Complex networks; Gateways (computer networks); Heuristic methods; Internet; Internet protocols; Optimization; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; End to end delay; End-to-end delay bounds; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi channel; Multihop; Resource-scheduling; Suboptimal solution; Time slots; Internet of things","Choi, H.H.; Department of Computer Science, Inha Technical College, 100 Inha-Ro, Namu-Gu, South Korea; email: hchoi@inhatc.ac.kr",,"Elsevier Ltd",00457906,,CPEEB,,"English","Comput Electr Eng",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978807242

For most sensor nodes, the macro cells of cellular networks provide cost-effective connectivity. However, covering the remaining nodes, which are either in the out-of-service state or have short-range wireless interfaces only, is a difficult issue. For example, when deploying small cells densely to provide fuller node coverage, the cost of the small cells should be well considered. From the perspective of economy, small cells that use the passive optical network (PON) and moderately priced wireless interfaces, called fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) in this paper, seem the most promising candidates. However, the flexibility in Fi-Wi system deployment is strictly constrained by the need for a stable power source. Because most of the PON systems have been developed for fiber to the home (FTTH), the gateway node on the customer premise continuously consumes power and thus requires a stable power source. Therefore, the key issue is how to reduce the power consumption of the Fi-Wi gateway node drastically enough to run continuously with only battery and/or solar power. Additionally, the power-saving approach must meet the requirements of the IoT applications at the same time. We focus on the deep sleep approach, which turns off almost all the components, with significant power savings at the cost of a drop in quality of service (QoS). This paper proposes methods to control the deep sleep while assuring successful packet reception. © 2015 IEEE.","Availability; energy conservation; optical fiber networks","Availability; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Fiber optic networks; Interface states; Internet; Internet of things; Optical fibers; Passive optical networks; Quality of service; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Sleep research; Solar energy; Wireless sensor networks; Fiber to the home; Internet connectivity; Internet of thing (IOT); Optical fiber networks; Optical network units; Short-range wireless; Wireless interfaces; Wireless sensor node; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23274662,,,,"English","IEEE Internet Things J.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982920458

The former is about filtering the significance in the appropriate format, while the latter provides emerging categories of the whole domain. This path of the data is a bottom-up flow. On the other hand, the path of the process is a top-down flow, starting at the strategic level of business and scientific institutions. Today, the path of the process treasures a sizeable amount of well-known methods, architectures and technologies: the so called Big Data. On the top, Big Data analytics aims variable association (e-commerce), data mining (predictive behaviour) or clustering (marketing segmentation). Digging the Big Data architecture there are a myriad of enabling technologies for data taking, storage and management. However the strategic aim is to enhance knowledge with the appropriate information, which does need of data, but not vice versa. In the way, the magnitude of upcoming data from the IoT will disrupt the data centres. To cope with the extreme scale is a matter of moving the computing services towards the data sources. This paper explores the possibilities of providing many of the IoT services which are currently hosted in monolithic cloud centres, moving these computing services into nano data centres (NaDa). Particularly, data-information processes, which usually are performing at sub-problem domains. NaDa distributes computing power over the already present machines of the IP provides, like gateways or wireless routers to overcome latency, storage cost and alleviate transmissions. Large scale questionnaires have been taken for 300 IT professionals to validate the points of view for IoT adoption. Considering IoT is by definition connected to the Internet, NaDa may be used to implement the logical low layer architecture of the services. Obviously, such distributed NaDa send results on a logical high layer in charge of the information-knowledge turn. This layer requires the whole picture of the domain to enable those processes of Big Data analytics on the top. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Safeguarding personal information privacy is an increasing concern in smart living services. To guarantee the mobile security of smart living services, security managers use taint checking approaches with dynamic taint propagation analysis operations to examine how a software-defined networking app uses sensitive information and investigate suspicious security vulnerabilities of devices and the effects of the spread of taint propagation over the Internet by identifying taint paths. For solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem, most approaches focus on cloud computing applications (apps) with malware threat analysis that involves program vulnerability analyses, rather than on the risk posed by suspicious apps connected to the cloud computing server. Accordingly, this article proposes a taint propagation analysis model incorporating a weighted spanning tree analysis scheme for tracking data with taint marking using several taint checking tools with an open software-defined networking architecture for solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem. In the proposed model, Android programs perform dynamic taint propagation to analyse the spread of risks posed by suspicious apps connected to the centralised gateway in a smart home system. In probabilistic risk analysis, risk and defence capability are used for each taint path to assist a defender in recognising the attack results against network threats caused by malware infection and to estimate the losses of associated taint sources. A case of threat analysis of a typical cyber security attack is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. A new approach was used for verifying the details of an attack sequence for malware infection by incorporating a finite state machine to appropriately represent the real dynamic taint propagation analysis situations at various configuration settings and safeguard deployment. The experimental results proved that the threat analysis model enables a defender to convert the spread of taint propagation to loss and estimate the risk of a specific threat using behavioural analysis associated with 60 families of real malware. Consequently, our scheme was significantly effective in predicting the risk and loss of tainted data propagation for security concerns in smart home systems when the number of taint paths associated with the propagation rules discovered through taint analysis was increased. © 2016 The Author(s).",,"Application programs; Automation; Cloud computing; Computer crime; Data privacy; Gateways (computer networks); Home networks; Information dissemination; Intelligent buildings; Internet; Malware; Network security; Personal communication systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Software defined networking; Trees (mathematics); Personal information; Probabilistic risk analysis; Program Vulnerability; Propagation rule; Security vulnerabilities; Sensitive informations; Smart-home system; Taint propagation; Data flow analysis","Wang, P.; Department of Information Management, Kun Shan UniversityTaiwan; email: pingwang@mail.ksu.edu.tw",,"Hindawi Limited",15501329,,,,"English","Int.

Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) is designed for VANETs to provide services efficiently. Since the control messages transmitted in WAVE are broadcast, the probability of collision increases by increasing the number of vehicle nodes. In this paper, we propose a coordinated multichannel medium access control (C-MAC) protocol for VANETs. The proposed C-MAC protocol provides contention-free broadcasting for safety messages by the coordination of roadside units (RSUs). An RSU schedules the broadcasting order of transmissions for safety messages. Contention-free broadcasting lowers the probability of collision and reduces the required time for transmissions of safety messages. An RSU may play the role of harvesting energy wirelessly to coordinated VANET terminals, which are gateways for Internet-of-things devices in the car. The contention interval for service channels is optimized to provide maximum throughput. The proposed C-MAC protocol is shown to enhance throughput and delay via analysis and simulation. © 2015 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; medium access control (MAC) protocol; safety message; vehicular ad hoc network (VANET); vehicular environment","Access control; Ad hoc networks; Broadcasting; Energy harvesting; Medium access control; Telecommunication networks; Analysis and simulation; Maximum through-put; Medium access control protocols; Multi-channel MAC protocols; Safety messages; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular environments; Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE); Vehicular ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189545,,ITVTA,,"English","IEEE Trans.

This work presents an Internet of Things (IoT) gateway service taking advantage of modern mobile devices and their capabilities to communicate with wearable Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors so data could be forwarded to the cloud on the fly and on real time. The service transforms a mobile platform (such as a smartphone) to a gateway allowing continuous and fast communication of data that is forwarded from the device to the cloud on demand or automatically for an automated decision making. Its features include (a) use of an internal processing mechanism for the BLE sensor signals and defines the way in which data is send to the cloud, (b) dynamic service as it has the ability to recognize new BLE sensors properties by easily adapting the data model according to a dynamic schema and (c) universal BLE devices capability that are registered automatically and are monitored on the fly while it keeps historical data that could be integrated into meaningful business intelligence.

The foundation of IoT is the rapid growth in the area of Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs). However, diversity and heterogeneity of WSANs in terms of communication networks pose challenges in integrating a wide range of networks into a unified IoT infrastructure. Redesigning communication infrastructure to accommodate different or new networks increases engineering time and cost. To address the inflexibility an FPGA-based reconfigurable gateway architecture is proposed in this paper. Any number and type of radio interfaces can be plugged in and made operational directly during runtime without decommissioning and redesigning the entire gateway device. By using this gateway, physically incompatible protocols are bridged to achieve seamless communications. Software layers running on top of the gateway virtualize the underlying heterogeneous networks and hence enable transparent communications for higher level intelligent services.

The energy is stored in the battery, and the sensor uses it for sensing and transmitting the reading to the user. A sensing cache can be implemented at a wireless gateway of the sensor to avoid activating the sensor too frequently, hence reducing its energy consumption. We develop an analytical model to investigate the benefit of the proposed caching mechanism. We also introduce the threshold adaptation algorithm that allows the sensing cache dynamically to adjust the parameter of caching to maximize the combined hit rate of the sensing service from multiple sensors. The performance evaluation clearly shows the tradeoff between energy consumption and caching. © 2016 IEEE.","caching; Internet of things (IoT); Markov chain","Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Markov processes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptation algorithms; caching; Caching mechanism; Hit rate; Internet of Things (IOT); Multiple sensors; Wireless communications; Wireless gateways; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479966646,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology plays a critical role for the construction of this paradigm. Hence, WSN technology should be adapted to support interoperability with the commodity internet entities. Since technological background of WSN and IP networks do not fit each other, this effort is not a straightforward process. In this paper, we introduce WiSEGATE which addresses end-to-end reliable interconnection problem between multiple internet entities and sensor nodes. WiSEGATE is a prototype of a new web server which supports three tier service scheme with a data acquisition mechanism of WSN to access the physical data in particular locations in the real world. In WiSEGATE, an interconnection gateway handles operations required for the interoperability. Since this gateway maintains reliable TCP/IP connections of the interconnected entities, the resource constraint sensor nodes on WSN do not require a TCP/IP stack for handling end-to-end connections. A lightweight service layer is implemented on a sensor node for operations required by the interconnection. The strength and novelty of the model lies in the fact that this lightweight service layer relieves extra memory usage for end-to-end connection management. For determining limits of the proposed model, firstly, we examined the steps for request/response mechanism and modeled the gateway as a queueing system. By doing this, we derive a definition of the request traffic. For proof of concept, we performed comprehensive tests in simulation and real testbed environments for WLAN connection. WiSEGATE can achieve reasonable response times up to 80 simultaneous connections from remote entities to WSN when WLAN PER is less than 0.2. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Gateway; IoT; TCP; WSN","Data acquisition; Internet; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Interoperability; Mobile telecommunication systems; Sensor nodes; Struts; Transmission control protocol; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; End-to-end connections; IoT; Light-weight service; Proof of concept; Resource Constraint; TCP; TCP/IP connections; WSN; Gateways (computer networks)","Baydere, S.; Department of Computer Engineering, Yeditepe UniversityTurkey; email: sbaydere@cse.yeditepe.edu.tr",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939455136

The training module uses a sequential teaching approach to draft quasi-experiments for teaching basic IoT concepts. Interfacing includes identification, embedded sensing and embedded actuating while connectivity includes wireless connectivity and web/mobile services. An IoT function (control and/or measurement) is first selected by users based on the physical variable of interest and the action to be carried out. The user will also select a connectivity option based on network types and transmission technologies available for communication between a sensor and/or an actuator and a gateway. The available connectivity options in this work are Bluetooth and RF. An interface is then setup based on the choices made using Arduino Pro Mini as microcontroller. Arduino Yun and a smartphone are the available gateway options depending on the connectivity option of the interface. When Bluetooth is the connectivity type on the interface, the smartphone is used as gateway while Arduino Yun serves as the gateway when RF is the connectivity option on the interface. The training module is accompanied with an instruction manual which contains instructions on the set ups and short notes on signals and systems, Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), Digital to Analog Converters (DAC), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), etc. The training module was tested with 100 randomly selected students. A few students had problems setting up the interface correctly. Coding the Arduino boards was a challenge for some of the students while a few others had challenges with creating sensor nodes. Choosing the correct connectivity type to match a gateway was the most challenging for the students. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","Actuator; Connectivity; Interface; Internet of Things; Sensor",,,,"American Society for Engineering Education",,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.

The performance of the protocols was evaluated using a network emulator, allowing us to emulate a low bandwidth, high system latency, and high packet loss wireless access network. This paper reports the observed performance of the protocols and arrives at the conclusion that although DDS results in higher bandwidth usage than MQTT, its superior performance with regard to data latency and reliability makes it an attractive choice for medical IoT applications and beyond. © 2016 IEEE.","CoAP; Constrained Wireless Access Network; DDS; Internet of Things; Medical Applications; MQTT; Protocols","Bandwidth; Computer network performance evaluation; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet protocols; Medical applications; Network protocols; Remote sensing; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Application protocols; CoAP; Data distribution services; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine-to-machine communications; MQTT; Wireless access networks; Wireless communication links; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509017430,,,"English","Int.

This SALA allows a smartphone to visually display the positions of IoT devices in indoor environments for the easy management of IoT devices, such as remote-control and monitoring. A smartphone plays a role of a mobile beacon that tracks its own position indoors by a sensor-fusion method with its motion sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. While moving around indoor, the smartphone periodically broadcasts short-distance beacon messages and collects the response messages from neighboring IoT devices. The response messages contains IoT device information. The smartphone stores the IoT device information in the response messages along with the message’s signal strength and its position into a dedicated server (e.g., home gateway) for the localization. These stored trace data are processed offline through our localization algorithm along with a given indoor layout, such as apartment layout. Through simulations, it is shown that our SALA can effectively localize IoT devices in an apartment with position errors less than 20 cm in a realistic apartment setting. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Algorithm; Device; Indoor; IoT; Localization; Smartphone; Trajectory","Algorithms; Apartment houses; Automation; Display devices; Gateways (computer networks); Indoor positioning systems; Intelligent buildings; Remote control; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Trajectories; Control and monitoring; Device; Device information; Indoor; Indoor environment; Internet of Things (IOT); Localization; Localization algorithm; Internet of things","Jeong, J.P.; Department of Interaction Science, Sungkyunkwan University, 2066 Seobu-ro, Jangan-gu, South Korea; email: pauljeong@skku.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",10220038,,WINEF,,"English","Wireless Networks",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973652791

Advances in Radio Frequency Identification technology (RFID), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), embedded systems, wired and wireless networks and reduced cost of transferring bits have accelerated the growth of M2M systems. However, due to lack of standardization, the M2M market is highly fragmented, proprietary and lacks widespread deployment. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the pioneering paradigm for ubiquitous computing where billions and trillions of devices would be connected together to sense information and to take actions without human intervention. Therefore, the end goal of M2M and IoT remains identical and it is only appropriate that M2M steadily evolves into IoT. Furthermore, with so many interconnected devices, the data generated would be overwhelming. Having this in mind, we chart an evolutionary path for M2M systems towards IoT from analytics perspective. We discuss challenges in M2M systems for analytics and provide solutions and on the basis of these solutions, propose a gateway-based reference architecture for analytics in M2M to facilitate its evolution towards IoT.

However, we found some problems with Farash et al.'s protocol, such as a known session-specific temporary information attack, an off-line password-guessing attack using a stolen-smartcard, a new-smartcard-issue attack, and a user-impersonation attack. Additionally, their protocol cannot preserve user-anonymity, and the secret key of the gateway node is insecure. The main intention of this paper is to design an efficient and robust smartcard-based user authentication and session key agreement protocol for wireless sensor networks that use the Internet of Things. We analyze its security, proving that our protocol not only overcomes the weaknesses of Farash et al.'s protocol, but also preserves additional security attributes, such as the identity change and smartcard revocation phases. Moreover, the results of a simulation using AVISPA show that our protocol is secure against active and passive attacks.

To date, the ability to perform forensic investigations on Z-Wave devices has largely been ignored; however, the placement of these devices in homes and industrial facilities makes them valuable assets for the investigation of criminal and adversarial actors. Z-Wave devices consist of sensors and actuators, which can be connected to the Internet via a gateway. Therefore, their memory contents may contain sensor reports of criminal activity or, more indirectly, provide evidence that the devices have been manipulated to achieve physical or cyber access. This paper provides details on extracting and programming the Flash and EEPROM memory of the ZW0301, which is a common Z-Wave transceiver module found on many Z-Wave devices. Specifically, the memory usage is characterized and several artifacts are identified. The feasibility of conducting a firmware modification attack on the ZW0301 is also explored.

We envision tomorrow's global-scale IoT systems should support global device reach-ability, mobility, diverse communication patterns, and resource efficiency. Existing solutions either rely on IP protocols that do not have efficient mobility support, or seek application-layer optimizations that incur high computing and deployment overhead. To fill this void, we propose to adopt cleanslate network architecture in the core network that decouples locators from network addresses, and towards this end, we propose MF-IoT, which is centered around the MobilityFirst architecture that focuses on mobility handling. MF-IoT enables efficient communication between devices from different local domains, as well as communication between devices and the infrastructure network. The MF-IoT network layer smoothly handles mobility during communication without interrupting the applications. This is achieved through a transparent translation mechanism at the gateway node that bridges an IoT domain and the core network. In the core network, we leverage MobilityFirst functionalities in providing efficient mobility support for billions of mobile devices through long, persistent IDs, while in the local IoT domain, we use short, local IDs for energy efficiency. By seamlessly translating between the two types of IDs, the gateway organically stitches these two parts of the network. Through large scale simulation studies, we show that MF-IoT is able to achieve the four features we envisioned for an IoT system, with performance optimizations in reducing network traffic load, avoiding congestion, and ensuring fast and timely packet delivery. © 2016 IEEE.","IoT; Network architecture","Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet protocols; Mobile devices; Network architecture; Network layers; Reconfigurable hardware; Translation (languages); Diverse communications; Efficient communications; Infrastructure networks; Internet of things architectures; Large scale simulations; Network traffic loads; Performance optimizations; Resource efficiencies; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467399487,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

One important challenge that need to be handled is the enormous amount of data generated by sensing devices, that make the control of sending useless data very important. In order to face with this challenge, there is a increasing interest about predictive approaches to avoid to send high spatio-temporal correlated data. Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm is a method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models that is becoming increasingly popular in the context of IoT. By exploiting BP, we can derive effective methods to drastically reduce the number of transmitted messages, while keeping high the data throughput in the global information system. In this paper, we propose a BP approach in a hierarchical architecture with simple nodes, gateways and data centers.

End users expect to connect quickly and transparently via any endpoint device, be it a phone, tablet, wearable, TV, car, or other system that is Internet enabled. Smart IoT devices can serve as versatile control system interfaces, allowing for rapid response and potentially ubiquitous access. However, these devices can present significant security challenges. Using these technologies for user access control at IoT endpoints is vulnerable to replay, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. This paper presents a model that combines the capabilities of smart IoT devices with control system gateways using real-time challenge response for secure control operations. The proposed solution using both endpoint and gateway devices employs a mix of compute, cryptography, signal/image processing, and communication capabilities for authentication and authorization functions.

A convenient way to do that is to digitize all the received signals in one shot and then to digitally perform the signal processing, as it is done in software-defined radio (SDR). All signals can be emitted with very different features (bandwidth, modulation type, and power level) in order to respond to the various propagation conditions. Their difference in terms of power levels is a problem when digitizing them together, as no current commercial analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can provide a fine enough resolution to digitize this high dynamic range between the weakest possible signal in the presence of a stronger signal. This paper presents an RF front end receiver architecture capable of handling this problem by using two ADCs of lower resolutions. The architecture is validated through a set of simulations using Keysight's ADS software. The main validation criterion is the bit error rate comparison with a classical receiver. ©2016.

To this end, we propose an IoT uplink multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) scheduling scheme (IoT-UL-MIMO) for which a multi-user (MU)-MIMO capability is implemented in the IoT-gateway device to greatly extend the uplink bandwidth and support the massive data delivery from a plurality of devices toward the gateway. In the IoT-UL-MIMO, a simple user-selection process that selects a proper set of transmitters by just counting the number of successful control-frame transmissions from the devices is used without a channel-sensing mechanism. The aim of this design principle is a mitigation of the system complexity that reduces the energy consumption, which is a key consideration for resource-constrained IoT devices.

However, unnecessary sector switching in multicast transmissions with directional antennas results in a long delay, and consequently a low throughput. We propose asymmetric directional multicast (ADM) for capillary M2M to address this problem in mmWave communications. ADM provides asymmetric sectorization that is optimized for the irregular deployment pattern of mulicast group members. In ADM, an M2M gateway builds up asymmetric sectors with a beamwidth of a different size to cover all multicast group members with the minimum number of directional transmissions. The performance of ADM under various simulation environments is evaluated through a comparison with legacy mmWave multicast. The results of the simulation indicate that ADM achieves a better performance in terms of the transmission sectors, the transmission time, and the aggregate throughput when compared with the legacy multicast method. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Asymmetric sectorization; Capillary machine-to-machine; Directional multicast; Internet of things; Millimeter Wave communications","Antennas; Internet of things; Millimeter waves; Multicasting; Directional transmission; Machine to machines; Machine-to-machine (M2M); Millimeter waves (mmwave); Millimeter-wave communication; Multicast group members; Multicast transmissions; Sectorization; Directive antennas","Kim, E.-J.; Department of Convergence Software, Hallym University, 1 Hallymdaehak-gil, South Korea; email: ejkim32@hallym.ac.kr",,"MDPI AG",14248220,,,,"English","Sensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963491051

As cellular networks can already be perceived almost as ubiquitous, they can potentially provide IoT systems access to the Internet regardless of their location. However, increased use of commercial cellular networks to provide connectivity for IoT systems would also change the traffic mix of these networks. It has been measured earlier that a large number of small packets are challenging for different wireless access networks to provide high performance. Currently, small packets are transmitted, for example, with Voice over IP (VoIP) services. Many IoT applications, being based on constrained sensor devices and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) type of communications, can increase the number of small packets significantly. In this paper, we measure the performance of Long Term Evolution (LTE) uplink as a backhaul for IoT networks. We experiment with differently sized packets in order to find optimal packet sizes that can result in maximum utilization of available resources in the LTE air interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to thoroughly evaluate LTE uplink performance with different packet sizes based on empirical evidence. The results indicate that with very small packets the throughput performance is less than half from that obtained with large packets. As an application to exploit the achieved results, we propose IoT gateway solutions to perform packet aggregation at mobile edge to maximize resource utilization in the air interface. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet telephony; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Voice/data communication systems; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Constrained sensors; Internet of thing (IOT); Machine-to-machine (M2M); Optimal packet sizes; Resource utilizations; Throughput performance; Voice over IP services; Wireless access networks; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467392921,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

The monitoring system for forest fires should be able to make a real-time monitoring of the target region and the early detection of fire threats. In this paper, we present a new approach for forest fire detection based on the integration of Data Mining techniques into sensor nodes. The idea is to use a clustered WSN where each sensor node will individually decide on detecting fire using a classifier of Data Mining techniques. When a fire is detected, the corresponding node will send an alert through its cluster-head which will pass through gateways and other cluster-heads until it will reach the sink in order to inform the firefighters. We use the CupCarbon simulator to validate and evaluate our proposed approach. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that our approach can provide a fast reaction to forest fires while consuming energy efficiently. © 2016 ACM.","Data mining; Fire detection; Intelligent decision making; Wireless sensor networks","Cloud computing; Data mining; Decision making; Deforestation; Fire detectors; Fire hazards; Fires; Forestry; Internet; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Extensive simulations; Fire detection; Forest fire detection; Intelligent decision making; Monitoring system; New approaches; Real time monitoring; Target regions; Wireless sensor networks",,"Guezouli L.Cruz H.T.Hidoussi F.Boubiche D.E.Bounceur A.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450340632,,,"English","ACM Int.

It is a disruptive technology capable of transforming and enriching human experience. Traditionally, applications collected context data directly from sensors and utilized them to target a narrow set of use cases. However, this is not a scalable approach. With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), which envisions billions and trillions of sensors and devices generating context data, a common infrastructure or middleware for managing context is paramount for development, deployment and widespread use of context-aware applications. However, managing context in IoT is fraught with challenges. To this end, we propose Machine-to-Machine (M2M) as a podium for managing context life cycle in an IoT environment. We systematically discuss challenges in each phase of context life cycle and provide solutions and based on these solutions, propose a gateway-based reference architecture, entailing hierarchical hybrid context modelling and reasoning, for context management in IoT. We demonstrate the proof of concept by implementing a prototype for the reference architecture. The proposed reference architecture also derives importance from the fact that it does not radically alter the existing end-to-end M2M system architecture and aids in standardization activities. © 2015 IEEE.","context; context awareness; context life cycle; Internet of Things; machine-to-machine communications; middleware; pervasive computing; system architecture; ubiquitous computing","Automation; Computer architecture; Gateways (computer networks); Information systems; Internet; Life cycle; Middleware; Nanoelectronics; Ubiquitous computing; User interfaces; context; Context aware applications; Context- awareness; Context-aware computing; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine-to-machine (M2M); Machine-to-machine communications; System architectures; Internet of things","Anand, P.; Radisys CorporationIndia; email: pratik.anand84@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467396912,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Findings: As of now surveys have been made in silos like various interconnection techniques or migration techniques for Wireless Sensor Networks to the best of our knowledge not much have been proposed about the feasible interconnection model towards Internet of Things. Our paper attempts to fill this gap and we have also studied the possible adaptation and integration of techniques like Software Defined Networks and virtualization towards Internet of Things. Software Defined Networks can provide us the much needed control for the Internet of Things and virtualization can provide us with re-usability. We have also highlighted how we can visualize a sensor node as a service or as a database. As of now very less work has been carried out about integration of these towards Web of Things. Applications/Improvements: We are also developing an architecture incorporating these layers namely the SDN and the virtualization and we have planned to test it using real time deployment in future.","Data centric networks; Integration of wsn to IoT; Internet of Things (IoT); Software Defined Network (SDN); Survey of interconnection techniques; Virtualization",,"Jayavel, K.; Department of Information Technology, SRM UniversityIndia; email: kayalvizhi.j@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in",,"Indian Society for Education and Environment",09746846,,,,"English","Indian J.

The recent emergence of IoT devices with embedded execution environments allows practitioners to deploy and execute custom application logic directly on the device. This approach fundamentally changes the overall process of designing, developing, deploying, and managing IoT systems. However, these devices exhibit significant differences in available execution environments, processing, and storage capabilities. To accommodate this diversity, a structured approach is needed to uniformly and transparently deploy application components onto a large number of heterogeneous devices. This is especially important in the context of large-scale IoT systems, such as in the smart city domain. In this article, we present LEONORE, an infrastructure toolset that provides elastic provisioning of application components on resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge devices in large-scale IoT deployments. LEONORE supports push-based as well as pull-based deployments. To improve scalability and reduce generated network traffic between cloud and edge infrastructure, we present a distributed provisioning approach that deploys LEONORE local nodes within the deployment infrastructure close to the actual edge devices. We show that our solution is able to elastically provision large numbers of devices using a testbed based on a real-world industry scenario. © 2016 ACM.","Framework; Gateway; IoT; Large-scale; Provisioning; Resource-constrained","Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); Reconfigurable hardware; Application components; Execution environments; Framework; Heterogeneous devices; Internet of Things (IOT); Large-scale; Provisioning; Resource-constrained; Internet of things",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",15335399,,,,"English","ACM Trans.

The system built tree type wireless sensor network based on Zigbee technology, and designed collection node, gateway nodes, relay nodes and control nodes based on STM32W108. The data acquisition nodes had self-powered internal battery, with low power consumption hardware design and software energy-saving mechanism. The system had the characteristics of high integration and strong extension, with multiple USB extended port used to extend the other types of sensors besides the integrated temperature-humidity sensor and light intensity sensor. The high definition images (1080p) of crop leaves texture only transmitted by power line were realized to warn diseases and pests early by introduction of power line communication technology in the system. The system was tested in a 2,400 m2 greenhouse with three-dimensional hybrid of strawberries and dendrobium officinale. The data acquisition nodes were set in the random position of the greenhouse and counted the packet loss, which the result of the packet loss ratio was close to zero. According to the actual working conditions, the voltage of data acquisition nodes decreased 400mV in 30 d, and the nodes charged by movable power sources can work more than 5 months with full power. Therefore, the nodes' characteristics of stability and power can satisfy the system requirements.","Power line communication technology; STM32W108; Wireless sensor network; Zigbee technology","Complex networks; Data acquisition; Decision making; Energy conservation; Gateways (computer networks); Greenhouses; Information management; Packet loss; Reconfigurable hardware; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; Data acquisition nodes; Energy saving mechanism; Intelligent decision making; Internet of Things (IOT); Power line communication technology; STM32W108; Temperature-humidity sensors; ZigBee technology; Sensor nodes","Tong, M.; School of Information Engineering, Zhejiang A and F University, Computer Science and TechnologyChina; email: 347158697@qq.com",,"Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering",08582114,,IAEJE,,"English","Int Agric Eng J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969932174

The demand for water supply is ever increasing and satisfying this requirement has been a major challenge for many countries around the world. Urbanization, climatic changes and wasteful usage has further depleted the resource. Water being one of the major requirements for human survival, conservation and management of the resource must be given utmost importance. Ensuring access to safe and clean water is another issue that requires attention. In this paper, we present an IPv6 network connected IoT design for real-time water flow metering and quality monitoring. Our prototype implementation uses CoAP for monitoring and control approach which supports internet based data collection. The system addresses new challenges in the water sector-ease of billing, fair billing and the need for a study of supply versus consumption of water in order to create awareness to curb water wastage and encourage its conservation. Automatic detection of leakage through any of the outlets is notified to the user. We also measure the quality of water distributed to every household by deploying pH and ORP sensors. The traditional water metering systems require periodic manual intervention for both metering and maintenance making it inconvenient and often least effective. Shortcomings of the existing models call for a ubiquitous usage of wireless systems for smart water flow metering and quality monitoring. We propose to do this with the aid of CC2538 motes programmed using ContikiOS to monitor the water consumption and communicate the data to a gateway wirelessly. © 2015 IEEE.","6LoWPAN; Contiki; IoT; IPv6; Water; Wireless","Flow measurement; Flow of water; Flowmeters; Gateways (computer networks); Human resource management; Hydraulics; Internet; Internet protocols; Radio; Water; Water management; Water quality; Water supply; 6LoWPAN; Automatic Detection; Contiki; IPv6; Manual intervention; Monitoring and control; Prototype implementations; Water metering systems; Internet of things",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21531684,9781509002931,,,"English","Int.

IoTs are power and bandwidth-constrained with applications in smarthome, healthcare, transportation and industrial domains. Routing bears significant importance in IoTs where sensors acting as hosts deliver data to the gateways which in turn impacts power consumption. Thus there exists a need for modeling and analysis of routing in IoT networks towards predicting power consumption. In this work, we develop an analytical model of a naive flooding based routing protocol using Markov chains. In particular, we derive steady state transition probabilities of transmit and receive states using protocol execution traces and further utilize them towards predicting power consumption. Our approach to modeling is generic in that it can be applied to routing protocols across domains. Evaluation of the model shows that the predicted values for power consumption lie closer to the actual observations obtained using ns-2 simulation thus resulting in minimal mean square errors. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Decision making; Electric power utilization; Markov processes; Mean square error; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Bandwidth-constrained; Internet of thing (IoTs); Minimal mean square error; Model and analysis; NS-2 simulations; Protocol execution; Real-time communication; Steady state; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467373098,,,"English","Int.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The underlying data source being sensors or interconnection of them, predominantly communicating wirelessly (WSN), our paper attempts to survey and analyze all the interconnection models that provide information to the users exploiting or extracting information at their own capacities. We have grounded our survey based on the role of gateway and nodes, hops, connection points, robustness, suitability, resilience, scalability, topology and their adaptability towards IoT. Findings: As of now surveys have been made in silos like various interconnection techniques or migration techniques for Wireless Sensor Networks, to the best of our knowledge not much have been proposed about the feasible interconnection model towards Internet of Things. Our paper attempts to fill this gap and we have also studied the possible adaptation and integration of techniques like Software Defined Networks and virtualization towards Internet of Things. Software defined networks can provide us the much needed control for the Internet of Things and virtualization can provide us with re-usability. We have also highlighted how we can visualize a sensor node as a service or as a database. As of now very less work has been carried out about integration of these towards Web of Things. Applications/Improvements: We are also developing an architecture incorporating these layers namely the SDN and the virtualization and we have planned to test it using real time deployment in future.","Data centric networks; Integration of WSN to IoT; Internet of Things (IoT); Software Defined Network (SDN); Survey of interconnection techniques; Virtualization",,"Jayavel, K.; Department of Information Technology, SRM UniversityIndia; email: kayalvizhi.j@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in",,"Indian Society for Education and Environment",09746846,,,,"English","Indian J.

It provides both efficient device management as well as security workflow for Internet of Things applications, making it especially suitable for use in constrained networks. However, most of the ongoing research activities on this topic focus on the server domain of LWM2M. Enabling relevant LWM2M functionalities on the client side is not only critical and important but challenging as well since these end-nodes are invariably resource constrained. In this paper, we address those issues by proposing the client-side architecture for LWM2M and its complete implementation framework carried out over Contiki-based IoT nodes. We also present a lightweight IoT protocol stack that incorporates the proposed LWM2M client engine architecture and its interfaces. Our implementation is based on the recently released OMA LWM2M v1.0 specification, and supports OMA, IPSO as well as third party objects. We employ a real world application scenario to validate its usability and effectiveness. The results obtained indicate that the memory footprint overheads incurred due to the introduction of LWM2M into the client side IoT protocol stack are around 6-9%, thus making this implementation framework very appealing to even Class 1 constrained device types. © 2015 IEEE.","Constrained Nodes; Device Management; Internet of Things; IoT Gateway; IPSO Objects; L WM2M; OMA Objects","Condition monitoring; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Network architecture; Specifications; Constrained Nodes; Device management; IPSO Objects; L WM2M; OMA Objects; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467393980,,,"English","IEEE Conf.

IoT (smart) end devices forward their traffic to the Internet, either by direct communication to LTE networks, or by multi-hop transmissions to a specific gateway. Acquiring both types of communication capabilities would be unnecessarily costly for IoT end devices. Instead, to lower the overall cost, only devices performing as gateways could be fully equipped with such capabilities, while the rest of the devices could have simple low cost wireless transmitters for forwarding the traffic towards a gateway. Towards this end, the decision on gateway placement is critical to provide low cost and Quality of Service (QoS). To address this design problem, we present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) that minimizes the total cost of the network with respect to the deployed devices, while achieving mandatory QoS requirements.

IoT is based on wireless sensor network (WSN), and Zigbee is one of the most popular WSN protocols. A mature IoT environment involves heavy WSN data transmission causing bottleneck problems. However, Zigbee's AODV routing stack does not have load balance mechanism to handle bursty traffic. Therefore, we develop Multipath Load Balancing (MLB) Routing to substitute Zigbee's AODV routing. Our proposed MLB consists of two main designs: LAYER-DESIGN and LOAD-BALANCE. LAYER-DESIGN assigns nodes into different layers based on node distance to IoT gateway. Nodes can have multiple next-hops delivering IoT data. All neighboring layer nodes exchange flow information containing current load, used by LOAD-BALANCE to estimate future load of next-hops. With MLB, nodes can choose the neighbors with the least load as the next-hops and thus can achieve load balance and avoid bottlenecks. Compared with Zigbee's AODV and multipath version AODV (AOMDV), experiment results demonstrate that MLB achieves better load balance, lower packet loss rate, and better routing connectivity ratio in both grid and random uniform topologies. MLB provides a more convincing routing solution for IoT applications. © 2016 Chinyang Henry Tseng.",,"Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Network management; Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Zigbee; Bottleneck problem; Bursty traffic; Different layers; Generation technologies; Internet of Things (IOT); IOT applications; Load-balancing routing; Packet loss rates; Internet of things","Tseng, C.H.; Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taipei UniversityTaiwan; email: tsengcyt@gm.ntpu.edu.tw",,"Hindawi Limited",1687725X,,,,"English","J.

Thus, users are allowed to access the nodes in the real-time as and when required. The user authentication plays an indispensable part in this communication. Recently, Farash et al. proposed an efficient user authentication scheme for WSNs. Though their scheme is very efficient, we identify that their scheme is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack, off-line identity guessing attack, stolen smart card attack and user impersonation attack. As a result, we feel that there is a great need to improve Farash et al.’s scheme to present a secure communication protocol. In this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight user authentication and key agreement scheme for distributed WSN, which will also be handy in taking care of the Internet of Things (IoT). The lightweight property of our proposed scheme can be useful in resource-constrained architecture of WSNs. In addition, our scheme has merit to change dynamically the user’s password locally without the help of the base station or gateway node. Furthermore, our scheme supports dynamic nodes addition, after the initial deployment of nodes in the existing sensor network. We prove the authentication property of our scheme using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic.

Sensors and smart objects are beside classical computing devices key parties of the IOT. We can already exploit the benefits of the IOT by using various weareables or smart phones which are full of diverse sensors and actuators and are connected to the II via GPRS or Wi-Fi. Since sensors are a key part of IOT, thus are wireless sensor networks (WSN). Researchers are already working on new techniques and efficient approaches on how to integrate WSN better into the IOT environment. One aspect of it is the security aspect of the integration. Recently, Turkanović et al.'s proposed a highly efficient and novel user authentication and key agreement scheme (UAKAS) for heterogeneous WSN (HWSN) which was adapted to the IOT notion. Their scheme presented a novel approach where a user from the IOT can authenticate with a specific sensor node from the HWSN without having to communicate with a gateway node. Moreover their scheme is highly efficient since it is based on a simple symmetric cryptosystem. Unfortunately we have found that Turkanović et al.'s scheme has some security shortcomings and is susceptible to some cryptographic attacks. This paper focuses on overcoming the security weaknesses of Turkanović et al.'s scheme, by proposing a new and improved UAKAS. The proposed scheme enables the same functionality but improves the security level and enables the HWSN to dynamically grow without influencing any party involved in the UAKAS. The results of security analysis by BAN-logic and AVISPA tools confirm the security properties of the proposed scheme. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Authentication; AVISPA tools; BAN-logic; Internet of Things; Key agreement; Wireless sensor networks","Authentication; Computation theory; Cryptography; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Mobile security; Network security; Sensor nodes; Smartphones; Wireless sensor networks; BAN logic; Classical computing; Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks; Internet infrastructure; Internet of Things (IOT); Key agreement; Sensors and actuators; Symmetric crypto systems; Internet of things","Hölbl, M.; University of Maribor, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceSlovenia; email: marko.holbl@um.si",,"Elsevier",15708705,,,,"English","Ad Hoc Netw.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948712087

Wireless technologies are important assets in the diffusion of this concept, as they allow the easy and seamless connection of all devices. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being established for sensing and actuating critical applications, like industrial automation, domotics and remote patient monitoring. The 6LoWPAN protocol has been proposed as the key to integrate WSNs and internet procotols. It is based in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is widely used in low power wireless networks.

This paper provides a distributed security mechanism that targets Class-0 IoT devices. The research goal is to secure the entire data path in two segments, deviceto- gateway and gateway-to-server data communications. The main concern in the provided solution is that lighter security operations with minimal resource requirements are performed in the IoT device, while heavier tasks are performed in the gateway side. The proposed mechanism utilizes a symmetric encryption for data objects combined with the native wireless security to offer a layered security technique between the device and the gateway. In the offered solution, the IoT gateways provide additional protection by securing data using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

IoT goes beyond a broad range of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication technologies and covers a wide variety of networking protocols. There exist solutions like MQTT or SIP collecting data from sensors, CoAP for constrained devices and networks, or XMPP for interconnecting devices and people. Also there is a plethora of standards and frameworks (OSGi, AllJoyn) bringing closer the paradigm of IoT vision. However, the main constraint of most existing platforms is their limited mutual interoperability. To this end, we provide a comprehensive description of protocols suitable to support the IoT vision. Further, we advocate an alternative approach to already known principles and employ the SIP protocol as a container for M2M data. We provide description of data structures and practical implementation principles of the proposed structures (JSON and Protocol Buffers are discussed in detail) transmitted by SIP as a promising enabler for efficient M2M communication in the IoT world.

Virtual training environments. The research is mandated by technology advances in internetworking underpinned by 5G networks and Internet-of-Things. These advances present new possibilities and challenges to integrate people, places and things in virtual environments. Existing frameworks such as MPEG-V possess representational capabilities but have insufficient support for integrating entities from the real world via heterogeneous infrastructure. MPEG-V for instance makes no statements about distributed control. Seamless experiences in virtual environment require self-organization of connectivity between people, places and things via heterogeneous 5G and Internet-of-Things infrastructures. A second important aspect of the quality of our experience is the immediacy of responses. Both aspects of seamless and self-organizing connections between entities require that we push control to the end-devices co-located with the entities themselves. These end-devices may incorporate sensing gateways and interaction devices, which include both local and non-local information from the virtual environment in the interaction. Thus delegation of control to end-devices requires means for the organizing or relations and clustering by relevance. This capability is particularly important as the projected number of devices and sensors to be connected via the Internet-of-Things is projected to be in the order of 50 billion by 2020. Immersive Networking supported by MediaSense [1] constitutes a scalable self-organizing means for connecting people and places and things in virtual environments with augmented reality. MediaSense moves control to the edge enabling immediacy in experiences based on seamless self-organization through clustering of entities in relations organized by relevance. We conclude by validating our approach in several scenarios evaluating the relevance and application in human decision-making. © 2016 SERSC.","Distributed immersive networking; Human decision-making; Internet-of-Things; Serious gaming","Augmented reality; Behavioral research; Decision making; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Virtual reality; Human decision making; Immersive; Interaction devices; Representational capabilities; Seamless experience; Serious gaming; Technology advances; Virtual training environments; Internet of things",,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",19750080,,,,"English","Int.

Web technology offers efficient support for global communications and wide access to services and information. WebServices-enabled devices allow the usage of different existing Web technologies for the development of applications in a more scalable and flexible way. For this purpose, homogenous and seamless end-to-end communication needs to be enabled independently of concrete solutions or specific Web-clients. WoT offers CoAP as a lightweight WebServices-based protocol for IoT devices. The main challenge is that CoAP has not been completely integrated into the existing Web clients without the need of intermediate application servers, proxies or gateways for the deployment of a fully end-to-end paradigm between end-clients (e.g., Web-browsers) and end-nodes (e.g., Sensors/Actuators).

The Smart Home is one of the key scenarios in which AXIOM could be useful for the Internet-of-Things (IoT). In Smart Homes, everything is linked to the flow of information that from the ""on the field"" devices needs to arrive to the cloud servers. The information sensed in the environment will not be transmitted as is to the higher layers, but is somehow interpreted to provide a synthetic light-weight representation of the environment. In such a scenario, it is then clear that there is a need for peripheral nodes as well as intermediate gateways which needs to be able to perform high-performance computational loads. AXIOM provides the possibility of designing a cluster of low-power/low-budget boards, which could be packed inside a ""high-performance embedded low-cost product."" The AXIOM boards are heterogeneous, thus allowing for even greater diversity which is needed in those kind of IoT scenarios.

Even though the home network application is developing rapidly, researches on the home gateway based open development architecture are less. This makes it difficult to extend the home network to support new applications, share service, and interoperate with other home network systems. An integrated access gateway (IAGW) is proposed in this paper which upward connects with the operator machine-to-machine platform (M2M P/F). In this home network scheme, the gateway provides standard interfaces for supporting various applications in home environments, ranging from on-site configuration to node and service access. In addition, communication management ability is also provided by M2M P/F. A testbed of a simple home network application system that includes the IAGW prototype is created to test its user interaction capabilities. Experimental results show that the proposed gateway provides significant flexibility for users to configure and deploy a home automation network; it can be applied to other monitoring areas and simultaneously supports a multi-ubiquitous sensor network. © 2016 Fei Ding et al.",,"Automation; Home networks; Intelligent buildings; Network architecture; Network layers; Personal communication systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor networks; Communication management; Gateway architecture; Home automation networks; Home network system; Improving efficiency; Internet of thing (IOT); Network applications; Ubiquitous sensor networks; Gateways (computer networks)","Song, A.; School of Instrument Science and Engineering, Southeast University, 2 Sipailou, China; email: a.g.song@seu.edu.cn",,"Hindawi Publishing Corporation",1687725X,,,,"English","J.

Particularly, IoT devices are composed of low performance MCU and small-capacity memory because they are miniaturized, so they are likely to be exposed to various security threats like DoS attacks. In addition, in case of IoT devices installed for a remote place, it's not easy for users to control continuously them and to install immediately security patch for them. For most of IoT devices connected directly with internet under user's intention, devices exposed to outside by setting IoT gateway, and devices exposed to outside by the DMZ function or Port Forwarding function of router, specific protocol for IoT services was used and the devices show a response when services about related protocol are required from outside. From internet search engine for IoT devices, IP addresses are inspected on the basis of protocol mainly used for IoT devices and then IP addresses showing a response are maintained as database, so that users can utilize related information. Specially, IoT devices using HTTP and HTTPS protocol, which are used at usual web server, are easily searched at usual search engines like Google as well as search engine for the sole IoT devices. Ill-intentioned attackers get the IP addresses of vulnerable devices from search engine and try to attack the devices. The purpose of this study is to find the problems arisen when HTTP, HTTPS, CoAP, SOAP, and RestFUL protocols used for IoT devices are detected by search engine and are maintained as database, and to seek the solution for the problems. In particular, when the user ID and password of IoT devices set by manufacturing factory are still same or the already known vulnerabilities of IoT devices are not patched, the dangerousness of the IoT devices and its related solution were found in this study.

Hence, the Cloud emerged as a suitable solution for large-scale IoT applications to cope with the rapidly increasing devices and data volume. Furthermore, IoT broadened the scope of the Cloud to the real world and enabled new service models such as the Sensing as a Service model. The convergence of both technologies stimulated innovations in both fields, we refer to this convergence as the Cloud of Things. The Cloud of Things enables users to request a complex IoT service (IoT application composed of several interconnected micro services) and deploy it seamlessly. However, deploying a complex IoT service in the Cloud of Things infrastructure is a difficult process due to the different types of physical nodes (Cloud data centers, IoT devices, gateways, etc.) and multiple architectures to collect and process data. Furthermore, network usage largely depends on the placement of different services across the network. In this paper, we present an efficient provisioning model of IoT services formulated as a Mixed Integer Problem. The objective is to minimize the cost of the deployment of IoT services in Cloud of Things infrastructure, through optimizing resources usage across physical nodes and bandwidth consumption over the network. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Complex networks; Bandwidth consumption; Cloud data centers; Different services; IOT applications; Micro services; Mixed integer problems; Service provisioning; Suitable solutions; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509013289,,,"English","IEEE Glob.

Respecting resource capacity constraints on edge devices establishes a firm requirement for a lightweight protocol in support of fine-grained telemetry of IoT deployment units. Such metering capability is needed when lack of resources among competing applications dictates our schedule and credit allocation. In response to these findings, the authors offer the DoT protocol that can be incorporated to implement real-time metering of IoT services for prepaid subscribers as well as Pay-per-use economic models. The DoT employs mechanisms to handle the IoT composite application resource usage units consumed/charged against a single user balance. Such charging methods come in two models of time-based and event-based patterns. The former is used for scenarios where the charged units are continuously consumed while the latter is typically used when units are implicit invocation events. The DoT-enabled platform performs a chained metering transaction on a graph of dependent IoT microservices, collects the emitted usage data, then generates billable artifacts from the chain of metering tokens. Finally it permits micropayments to take place in parallel. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Diameter protocol; Internet of things; Service metering","Economics; Internet protocols; Telemetering equipment; Composite applications; Credit allocations; Diameter protocol; Implicit invocation; Lightweight protocols; Real-time metering; Resource Constraint; Service metering; Internet of things","Qanbari, S.; Vienna University of TechnologyAustria; email: qanbari@dsg.tuwien.ac.at","Altmann J.Silaghi G.C.Rana O.F.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319431765,,,"English","Lect.

The integration between advanced technologies of ICT and tourism industry plays vital role in enhancing the tourism services and experiences, particularly, in the context of archaeological tourism. Following this, this study proposes a protocol that offers tourists site/destination and experiences according to their preferences. More specifically, tourists can express various preferences regarding the type of tourism site, their contention level in order to avoid crowded ones, the accessibility and convenience of different sections of a site, and the distance and congestion of the paths lead to such site …etc. Our Contention, Convenience and Accessibility based Smart Tourism-destination Approach (CASTA) is presented in this paper to offer online services for tourists assuming that they are always connected and they do not have advanced IT skills. A tourist has only to send a preference message that specifies all the personal constraints via a smart hand held device. A control unit that resides on the cloud analyzes the message and suggests a tour to certain sites and their sections based on the tourist preferences. Information about tourism sites and their sections, in terms of contention, convenience, and accessibility, is collected by wireless sensor networks and sent to the control unit via a gateway node. Results of simulated experiments of CASTA have shown that it outperforms the shortest path approach which suggests a tour based solely on the distance toward those tourism destinations. Moreover CASTA outperformance shortest path approach that takes the quality of network connections available over the selected paths. © 2016 MAA.","Archaeological site; Cloud-centric IoT; Internet of things IoT; Smart tourism destination; Tourism accessibility and convenience; Wireless sensor networks",,"Almobaideen, W.; King Abdullah II School of Information Technology, The University of JordanJordan; email: almobaideen@inf.ju.edu.jo",,"University of AGEAN",11089628,,,,"English","Mediterr.

This paper presents an approach to how existing production systems that are not Industry 4.0 can be transformed and expanded to Industry 4.0 factory. Within this paper, a concept is presented how production systems can be integrated in different stages and included into an Industry 4.0 environment, even though they did not have interfaces when they would have been manufactured. The concept of transformation is based on cyber physical system gateway and servers. Besides the concept itself, it also presents a validation that demonstrates where these interfaces are previously applied or integrated.

Specifically, data reduction at the network edge (e.g., on an IoT gateway device or a mini-server deployed locally at an IoT area network) can prevent I/O bottlenecks, as well as dramatically reduce storage, bandwidth, and energy costs. However, current solutions face two main obstacles towards achieving this benefits of network-edge computing. Firstly, the most efficient algorithms for data reduction of time series (which is one of the prevailing kinds of data in IoT) are developed to work a posteriori upon big datasets and they cannot take decisions per incoming data item. Secondly, the state of the art lacks systems that can apply any of many different possible data reduction methods without adding significant delays or heavyweight re-configurations. This paper presents a solution that automates the switching between different data handling algorithms at the network edge, including an analysis of adjusted data reduction methods, as well as three flavors of a new algorithm that is capable of performing real-time reduction of incoming time series items based on the concept of Perceptually Important Points. The potential benefits are evaluated upon real datasets from street, household, and robot sensors, showing that our solution achieves accuracies between 76,1 % and 93,8 % despite forwarding only 1/3 of the data items, without adding significant forwarding delays. © 2015 IFIP.",,"Algorithms; Big data; Data handling; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Real time systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Data handling algorithms; Data preprocessing; Perceptually important points; Personal devices; Potential benefits; Re-configurations; Reduction method; State of the art; Data reduction",,"Madeira E.R.M.Serrat J.Schonwalder J.Schmitt C.Tortonesi M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9783901882777,,,"English","Proc.

One popular IoT scenario features a smart home service gateway, which becomes the central point of user’s home environment facilitating a multitude of tasks. Given that most IoT devices connected to residential gateway are small-scale and battery-powered, the key challenge is to extend their lifetime without recharging/replacing batteries. To this end, a novel radio technology named Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has recently been completed to enable energy-efficient data transfer. Another inspiring innovation is the capability of sensors to harvest wireless energy in their local environment. In this work, we envision a scenario where many in-home sensors are communicating with a smart gateway over the BLE protocol, while at the same time harvesting RF energy transmitted from the gateway wirelessly via a dedicated radio interface. We thoroughly investigate performance limitations of such wireless energy transfer interface (WETI) with dynamic analytical model and with important practical considerations.

Maximizing the utilization of these sensors is hinged upon the ability to discover their capabilities (ex: measured attributes, location, accuracy, etc.). This process is known as Service Discovery (SD), and can have a local scope (SD within a bounded area), or a global scope. Traditionally, SD is performed using a dedicated gateway that is always active and connected to the Internet. This gateway stores the attributes of sensors within its area. However, this approach may be too expensive in the presence of billions of sensors. In this paper, a novel protocol for local SD is proposed that eliminates the need for a dedicated gateway. The protocol utilizes a multi-tier network architecture in order to achieve two main objectives: energy efficiency and high success rate in satisfying service requests. Energy efficiency is achieved by limiting the number of hops that an SD request has to traverse before being satisfied, while a high success rate is guaranteed using a hierarchical structure of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), where information regarding sensor capabilities is stored. Extensive computer simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol in comparison to single level architectures and gateway-based solutions. The results show that the proposed protocol achieves energy efficiency without sacrificing success rate of serving requests. © 2015 IEEE.","Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); Distributed Hash Tables (DHT); hierarchical architecture; Internet of Things(IoT); ontology; Service Discovery (SD); Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Data structures; Energy efficiency; Internet; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Ontology; Reconfigurable hardware; Wireless sensor networks; Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); Distributed hash tables; Hierarchical architectures; Internet of Things (IOT); Service discovery; Gateways (computer networks)",,"Kanhere S.Cherkaoui S.Tolle J.","IEEE Computer Society",,9781467367738,,,"English","Proc.

The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network.

ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism.

The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificatebased DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors to no longer need to perform expensive operations. The energyperformance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificatebased and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a wellsuited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Gateways (computer networks); Health care; Internet; Mobile telecommunication systems; Patient monitoring; Reconfigurable hardware; Remote patient monitoring; Ubiquitous computing; Certificate-based; End-to-end security; Energy performance evaluations; Internet of Things (IOT); Medical sensors; Security analysis; Security context; Security scheme; Internet of things",,"Atzori L.Jin X.Jarvis S.Liu L.Calvo R.A.Hu J.Min G.Georgalas N.Wu Y.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509001545,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT: heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a flow-based model for building IoT applications.

Possible source for security issues and vulnerabilities in IoT networks are caused due to its dynamic network topology, mobility and weak physical security of low power devices. Authentication, Authorization and Access control are important and critical functionalities in the context of IoT to enable secure communication between devices. It is infeasible to use conventional cryptography in IoT networks since security and privacy of critical data are crucial. In this paper, a secure and efficient authentication mechanism in IoT based healthcare system is proposed. Security and privacy of patients‟ medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Primary focus of this work is to provide a Multilayer Security using Linear Programmable Pre-coded Matrix Decomposition (MS_LPMD) method for secure authentication and authorization of remote in or out patients. The proposed architecture uses an efficient and secure key management scheme between IoT node and IoT s_gateway. In this approach during the pre-authentication phase, connection between IoT node and IoT secure gateway is established. The Secure Gateway being the primary authentication server validates unique pattern coefficients generated using LPMD process against the coefficients received from IoT Node for authentication. Authenticated IoT Node employs a simple light-weight computational process for cipher key generation used for subsequent encrypted data communication through a secure communication channel. Proposed MS_LPMD scheme is built to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of network data by making the system reliable and protecting the system from malicious attacks which can lead to information disclosure. The proposed MS_LPMD approach has outperformed other existing approaches such as AES, EDCH etc, in terms of higher security level and trust worthiness factor. The performance analysis revealed that our proposed MS_LPMD approach has less communication overhead and latency between the IoT Node and secure gateway. Using software-hardware co-designed IoT test bed, the computed results on standard simulation setup shows an average reduced overhead of 29% and latency of 21% when compared to existing EDCH scheme. © Research India Publications.","Authentication; Coefficients; Decryption; Encryption; Internet of things; MS_LPMD; Non-orthogonal; Security; Unique pattern",,,,"Research India Publications",09734562,,,,"English","Int.

This poses a challenge to apply analytics directly to raw IoT sensor data. Such operational data requires an intensive enrichment processes to drive value. Pragmatic use of naming conventions and taxonomies can increase the quality of data and make it more interpretable. In this paper, we incorporate semantic and linked data technologies and offer a middleware called Gatica, to dynamically inject semantics to make the raw streaming data of an IoT gateway 'Rich' on the device layer. Gatica collects the real-time sensor data, enriches them using annotations then transforms and exposes them in RDF triples, and finally streams RDF objects to the analytic endpoint for querying the linked sensor streaming data. Various analytic applications can utilize our middleware by sending SPARQL requests over the sensor network to our query interface and retrieving the results. Our middleware offers the ability to discover hidden patterns of mutually correlated variables and uncover actionable information within raw data for more utility.

This has resulted from the effort to adapt the cloud computing model towards services that can operate and utilize the resources inside the community network. The network and its infrastructure are contributed by individuals, companies, organizations and are maintained by the community itself. Community cloud devices are often low computing resource devices, such as home gateways, with limited capabilities. Currently, these devices are configured to run community services only. This has become a drawback for further adoption because of contributor's difficulty to also use the donated cloud device for private purposes. We apply container-based virtualization for the problem of resource sharing in low-capacity devices in order to create a multi-purpose execution environment in a single device. Thus, a single device can be configured to deliver to the user and the community a multi-purpose environment, such as personal and public, isolated from one another, while preserving the community cloud services. Our comparative analysis with the current infrastructure in community networks gives evidence that the capability of the devices to run concurrent services is maintained. © 2015 IEEE.","cloud services; community networks; Computing constrained-devices; virtualization","Big data; Distributed database systems; Internet; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Virtual reality; Web services; Cloud services; Community networks; Community services; Comparative analysis; Constrained devices; Execution environments; Large-scale computing; Virtualizations; Distributed computer systems",,"Younas M.Awan I.Mecella M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467381031,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Ideally, we wish technology to be versatile, time-efficient to implement, and cost-efficient to deploy. In this paper, we present our experience from the last five years of implementing OPC UA clients, servers, and gateways in various automation domains. As part of prototyping research demonstrators, the reduction of development effort was a general priority. Considering the footprint of the resulting implementation became a key concern when working on resource-constrained embedded platforms. What we would wish for is better out-of-the-box support of some of the presented techniques by the available SDKs. From practical experience, we find that the advantages of OPC UA technology can generally be harvested with both low implementation effort and footprint within servers. This makes it feasible particularly for embedded applications, and overall it becomes an ideal base technology for Industrial Internet of Things applications.

As information and communication technologies have been applied to the field systems in the traditional industries, they also have become connected and more vulnerable to the existing cyber attack techniques. To make matters worse, a practical malicious software suite was exposed from Italian hacking team by another leakage incident, which is noted by somebody as an insider's rip. Now, we worry about social problems caused by copycats. Nevertheless, more concerns have been arisen among experts about that this tendency is getting more serious when IoT (Internet of Things) environment has been realized. In an IoT environment, every device will be massively connected to each other. We can classify the IoT devices roughly into two categories, which are leaf devices and gateways. In this environment, anonymous devices may usually participate as a authorized consumer or producer for a service in the same domain with a gateway. The gateway may take a role for some devices as a delegate for specific services. Insider's exposure problem will be more serious concern in this situation. At a user's point of view, smart-phones for wearable devices, the AVN (Audio Visual Navigation) on smart cars and HMI host for ICS (Industrial Control Systems) are considered as gateways for IoT environments. In this situation, a canonical form of large scale IoT devices should be smart cars. The smart cars are going to include more software-incorporated electric components for intelligent safety functions adopted at the vacancy of the combustion engine and are also becoming connected and remotely controllable. This means these mobile devices cannot be free from the cyber security threats, which is solicited by insider devices [Stephen:CEA]. For a recent example, commercial networked vehicles were remotely hacked and controlled without any wired connections. In this panel, we will discuss current hot issues related to the malicious software in various aspects. In the existing mobile network and the connected smart devices, Android-based mobile malware is a big trouble. Combined malware is another problem among the emerging all-connected ICS equipment. Detecting these malicious behavior is one of the new IT challenges. We will share perspective ideas related to these topics among panelists and audiences through a professional discussion.","Cyber-physical systems; Industrial; Internet of things; Malware; Vulnerability","Audio systems; Commercial vehicles; Computer crime; Control systems; Crime; Electric machine control; Embedded systems; Gateways (computer networks); Intelligent control; Internet; Internet of things; Mobile devices; Personal computing; Reconfigurable hardware; Security systems; Smartphones; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Electric components; Industrial; Industrial control systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Malicious behavior; Traditional industry; Vulnerability; Malware",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450338240,,,"English","MIST - Proc.

Among the NAT traversal solutions, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project adopts the ALG solution for SIP/IMS multimedia services in the mobile networks.

The targeted problem of this paper is to enable the communication among devices in heterogeneous networks. Multiple Protocol Transport Network (MPTN) gateway is designed to be a distributed messaging gateway to enable messaging among multiple networks. To leverage the routing capability in existing network protocols, MPTN gateway converts an end-to-end message request to a multiple segment message based on network topology. The protocol schedules periodic routing table update to pro-actively keep the routing table up to dates with long time intervals, and allows on-demand route update to shorten the delay on topology and connectivity change. The performance evaluation results show that the protocol completes the table update within tens of milliseconds when there are more than ten devices in a system. © 2015 ACM.","Reliability; Synchronous/asynchronous operation","Complex networks; Heterogeneous networks; Internet of things; Network protocols; Network routing; Reconfigurable hardware; Reliability; Topology; Distributed messaging; Essential features; Evaluation results; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine-to-machine (M2M); Network deployment; Synchronous/asynchronous; Transport networks; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450337380,,,"English","Proc.

The traditional network management tools just monitor basic activity of network devices, but there is a common need for more complex solution including a mobile interface providing users with a convenient remote monitoring. Since the Internet of Things concept relays on the smart home gateway as a key component interacting with all sensors and appliances deployed within a building the network monitoring is not interesting only for network operators or companies. Also common end users want to have their intelligent households under a continuous control and be informed about specific events.

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.","AMQP; CoAP; DDS; Internet of Things (IoT); IoT gateway; mDNS; MQTT; XMPP","Big data; Decision making; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet protocols; Smart sensors; Surveys; AMQP; CoAP; DDS; Internet of Things (IOT); mDNS; MQTT; XMPP; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",1553877X,,,,"English","IEEE Commun.

However in many cases efforts are focusing on algorithms and systems requiring large amounts of processing power and constant data availability to be effective. In this paper, an approach tailored to the constrained resources in the IoT domain is introduced that is based on the Social IoT paradigm, instead of centralized computational nodes. The framework enables Smart Home Gateways to seek solutions to their heating schedule needs through communication of actual observations with fellow homes rather than brute force calculations based on probabilistic models that may require centralized approaches. Using the provided IoT components of the COSMOS ecosystem, Smart Homes may run purpose-built applications that use stored Knowledge, communicate it throughout the Network of Things and act on it in ways which aid the end users in retrieving relevant solutions. Raspberry-based simulations indicate that this diffusion of Knowledge as well as the improvements and evaluations through feedback performed on it, allow for the creation of a lightweight and resource effective approach, on the problem of Heating Management.","Internet of things; Knowledge diffusion; Social internet of things","Automation; Computer peripheral equipment; Diffusion; Energy utilization; Heating; Information science; Intelligent buildings; Internet; Centralized approaches; Computational nodes; Constrained resources; Diffusion of knowledge; Effective approaches; Greenhouse emissions; Knowledge diffusion; Probabilistic models; Internet of things",,"Akoumianakis D.Karanikolas N.N.Nikolaidou M.Xenos M.Vergados D.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450335515,,,"English","ACM Int.

This makes integration of such diverse technologies a challenging task. A typical solution to this problem is represented by universal gateways, which provide internal semantics for protocol translation. However such approach is bound to be challenged in future IoT scenarios, as it brings substantial performance impairments in settings with very large number of devices and of technologies. We address these limitations, by proposing two novel approaches. A first is based on distributing the management of the different technologies among gateways. A second approach makes use of Web Service delegation, with gateways acting only as a connecting point between the entities and some service that can interpret the information exchanged. We implement and validate experimentally these approaches, showing that they both scale sensibly better than the traditional approach, guaranteeing acceptable performance even with a high degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, we identify the criteria which should be considered when choosing between the two proposed approaches.

The combination of a gateway and devices with a wireless connection can provide flexibility, but there are limitations to the network capability of each gateway in terms of how many network connections can be accommodated. It would be possible to get rid of the constraint and provide further flexibility and stability if we could deal with multiple gateways and balance the connections. Therefore, we propose a dynamic reconfigurable wireless connection system that can hand over the device connection between gateways by introducing a driver management framework that migrates the driver module handling the network connection. We have implemented a prototype using smartphones as gateways, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors as devices, and a Web application that works on an extended Web runtime that can directly control a device from the application. The combination of these, composed by the user, can be migrated from the smartphone to other gateways (including the network connection) by dragging and dropping icons, after which the gateway and devices take over the combined task. We confirmed that the proposed architecture enables end users to utilize devices flexibly and can easily migrate the network connections of a particular service to another gateway. © 2015 IEEE.","Dynamic reconfiguration; Gateway; Heterogeneity; Internet of Things; Javascript; Mash-up; Smartphone","Application programs; Computer software; Dynamic models; Internet; Internet of things; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Dynamic re-configuration; Heterogeneity; Internet of thing (IOT); Javascript; Management frameworks; Mash up; Proposed architectures; Gateways (computer networks)",,"Ahamed S.I.Chang C.K.Crnkovic I.Hsiung P.-A.Yang J.Huang G.Chu W.","IEEE Computer Society",07303157,9781467365635,PSICD,,"English","Proc Int Comput Software Appl Conf",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962071215

Each protocol focuses on a specific aspect of IoT communications. The lack of a protocol that can handle the vertical market requirements of IoT applications including machine-to-machine, machine-to-server, and server-to-server communications has resulted in a fragmented market between many protocols. In turn, this fragmentation is a main hindrance in the development of new services that require the integration of multiple IoT services to unlock new capabilities and provide horizontal integration among services. In this work, after articulating the major shortcomings of the current IoT protocols, we outline a rule-based intelligent gateway that bridges the gap between existing IoT protocols to enable the efficient integration of horizontal IoT services. While this intelligent gateway enhances the gloomy picture of protocol fragmentation in the context of IoT, it does not address the root cause of this fragmentation, which lies in the inability of the current protocols to offer a wide range of QoS guarantees. To offer a solution that stems the root cause of this protocol fragmentation issue, we propose a generic IoT protocol that is flexible enough to address the IoT vertical market requirements. In this regard, we enhance the baseline MQTT protocol by allowing it to support rich QoS features by exploiting a mix of IP multicasting, intelligent broker queuing management, and traffic analytics techniques. Our initial evaluation of the lightweight enhanced MQTT protocol reveals significant improvement over the baseline protocol in terms of the delay performance. © 2015 IEEE.","IP networks; Logic gates; Performance evaluation; Protocols; Quality of service; Real-time systems; Wireless sensor networks","Commerce; Computer network performance evaluation; Gateways (computer networks); Integration; Interactive computer systems; Internet protocols; Logic gates; Multicasting; Network protocols; Quality control; Quality of service; Real time systems; Reconfigurable hardware; Telecommunication networks; Wireless sensor networks; Application protocols; Horizontal integrations; Intelligent gateway; Internet of Things (IOT); IP networks; Machine to machines; Performance evaluation; Server communications; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",01636804,,ICOMD,,"English","IEEE Commun Mag",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954166469

This new scenario, often referred as Internet of Things (IoT), gives raise to different issues and challenges to be coped with. Indeed, each kind of physical device comes with different technology details, low level communication protocols and can exhibit different semantic behaviors. In addition, the interaction between human beings and the physical objects must be properly managed. Two main approaches exist to cope with the mentioned issues: (i) the development of new ad-hoc technologies and solutions to deal with the specific issues raising from the new scenario, or (ii) the exploitation of well-known technologies and solutions also in the new context so as to facilitate the integration of the physical stuff with the preexisting internet services. The latter approach is usually referred as Web of Things (WoT). This paper proposes a possible implementation of the WoT vision. The resulting architecture allows creating complex applications where physical resources, internet resources and human resources can properly interact with each other. The objects of the physical world are virtualized and managed through the Smart Object (SO) concept. The SOs are enclosed in a Smart Gateway which exposes them to the world through an uniform web API based on REST paradigm. The human beings interaction is achieved using the popular micro-blogging platform Twitter. The integration between all the entities is provided by adopting a WS-BPEL workflow technology.

The IoT connects sensors and devices that record physical observations to applications and services of the Internet[1]. As a successor to technologies such as RFID and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), the IoT has stumbled into vertical silos of proprietary systems, providing little or no interoperability with similar systems. As the IoT represents future state of the Internet, an intelligent and scalable architecture is required to provide connectivity between these silos, enabling discovery of physical sensors and interpretation of messages between the things. This paper proposes a gateway and Semantic Web enabled IoT architecture to provide interoperability between systems, which utilizes established communication and data standards. The Semantic Gateway as Service (SGS) allows translation between messaging protocols such as XMPP, CoAP and MQTT via a multi-protocol proxy architecture. Utilization of broadly accepted specifications such as W3Cs Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology for semantic annotations of sensor data provide semantic interoperability between messages and support semantic reasoning to obtain higher-level actionable knowledge from low-level sensor data. © 2015 IEEE.","CoAP; Internet of Things (IoT); MQTT; Semantic Gateway as Service (SGS); Semantic Sensor Network (SSN)","Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Interoperability; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Reconfigurable hardware; Sanitary sewers; Semantic Web; Wireless sensor networks; CoAP; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); MQTT; Scalable architectures; Semantic annotations; Semantic interoperability; Semantic sensors; Internet of things",,"Zhang J.Altintas O.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467372848,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Otherwise many systems will face problems with storage costs, bandwidth and energy consumption, and database I/O throughput limits. This paper presents a framework and a mechanism for reducing time series data in Internet-of-Things environments based on their reconstruct ability. A two-phase mechanism is described for analyzing, selecting, and enforcing appropriate data reduction handlers in a way that reduces load while maintaining a requested degree of reconstruct ability of the original data. The approach has been evaluated upon real data from publicly available time series. Along with a proof-of-concept that the reconstructed time series have 85% - 99.9% similarity to the original data sets despite having forwarded no more than 20% of the data, the evaluation has shown that our solution can estimate the reconstruct ability of the reduced time series during an analysis phase which usually does not need to last longer than some tens or hundreds of seconds. © 2015 IEEE.","Computer architecture; Concrete; Databases; Detectors; Logic gates; Measurement; Time series analysis","Big data; Computer architecture; Concretes; Database systems; Detectors; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet of things; Logic gates; Measurements; Reconfigurable hardware; Time series analysis; Data-sources; Gateway devices; Internet of things architectures; Proof of concept; Storage costs; Time-series data; Two phase; Data reduction",,"Khan L.Barbara C.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467372787,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

We propose a resource-constrained asymmetric redundancy elimination algorithm (RCARE) to leverage downlink bandwidth and receiver capability to accelerate the uplink data transfer. RCARE can be deployed on a client or a proxy. Different from existing asymmetric algorithms, RCARE uses a flexible matching mechanism to identify redundant data and allocates a small sender cache to absorb the high downlink traffic overhead. Compared to existing redundancy elimination algorithms, RCARE provides a scalable sender cache that is adaptive based on resource and performance. We evaluate RCARE with real traffic traces collected from multiple servers and a campus gateway. The trace-driven simulation results indicate that RCARE achieves higher goodput gains and reduces downlink traffic compared to existing asymmetric communication algorithms. We design an adaptation algorithm for resource-constrained senders sending multiple data streams. Our algorithm takes samples from data streams and predicts how to invest cache size on individual data streams to achieve maximal uplink goodput gain. The adaptation algorithm improves the goodput gain by up to 87% compared to the baseline. In first 10% of data streams (sorted by the optimal goodput gains), RCARE achieves up to 42% goodput gain on average. © 2015 IEEE.","Asymmetric communications; Internet of Things; network protocols; performance evaluation","Bandwidth; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Redundancy; Adaptation algorithms; Asymmetric algorithms; Communication algorithms; Efficient communications; Multiple data streams; performance evaluation; Redundancy elimination; Trace driven simulation; Algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10636692,,IEANE,,"English","IEEE ACM Trans Networking",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028231490

This paper considers a smart parking infrastructure where sensors are laid down on the parking spots to detect car presence and RFID readers are embedded into parking gates to identify cars and help in the billing of the smart parking. Both types of devices are endowed with wired and wireless communication capabilities for reporting to a gateway where the situation recognition is performed. The sensor devices are tasked to play one of the three roles: (1) slave sensor nodes located on the parking spot to detect car presence/absence; (2) master nodes located at one of the edges of a parking lot to detect presence and collect the sensor readings from the slave nodes; and (3) repeater sensor nodes, also called “anchor” nodes, located strategically at specific locations in the parking lot to increase the coverage and connectivity of the wireless sensor network. While slave and master nodes are placed based on geographic constraints, the optimal placement of the relay/anchor sensor nodes in smart parking is an important parameter upon which the cost and effciency of the parking system depends. We formulate the optimal placement of sensors in smart parking as an integer linear programming multi-objective problem optimizing the sensor network engineering effciency in terms of coverage and lifetime maximization, as well as its economic gain in terms of the number of sensors deployed for a specific coverage and lifetime. We propose an exact solution to the node placement problem using single-step and two-step solutions implemented in the Mosel language based on the Xpress-MPsuite of libraries. Experimental results reveal the relative effciency of the single-step compared to the two-step model on different performance parameters. These results are consolidated by simulation results, which reveal that our solution outperforms a random placement in terms of both energy consumption, delay and throughput achieved by a smart parking network. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Internet-of-Things; Optimal sensor placement; Radio frequency identification; Smart parking; Wireless sensor networks","Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Integer programming; Internet of things; Parking; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Integer Linear Programming; Multi-objective problem; Node placement problems; Optimal placement of sensors; Optimal sensor placement; Performance parameters; Smart parking; Wired and wireless communications; Sensor nodes","Bagula, A.; Intelligent Systems and Advanced Telecommunication Laboratory Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of the Western Cape, Private Bag X17, South Africa",,"MDPI AG",14248220,,,,"English","Sensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934783840

An increasingly common pattern is therefore to interpose a smart phone as a network gateway, and to deliver GUIs for such devices. Implementing the pipeline from embedded device through a phone application to the Internet requires a complex and disjoint set of languages and APIs. We present fabryq, a platform that simplifies the prototyping and deployment of such applications. fabryq uses smartphones as bridges that connect devices using the short range wireless technology, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to the Internet. Developers only write code in one language (Javascript) and one location (a server) to communicate with their device. We introduce a protocol proxy programming model to control remote devices; and a capability-based hardware abstraction approach that supports scaling from a single prototype device to a deployment of multiple devices.

Allowing machine-to-machine (M2M) communication between these M2M devices also presents new commercial service opportunities. M2M service providers, including telecom carriers, may need to establish new networks to accommodate M2M interactions while identifying new business opportunities. Typically, M2M devices need another capable device, such as a smartphone, to act as a gateway to connect to the Internet to operate at their full potential.We propose a novel scheme in which any Internet-enabled device in the vicinity can act as an M2M gateway for M2M devices. This eliminates the need for the M2M device user to also own a smartphone or an Internet-enabled device to obtain services such as online-to-offline. This scheme faces new challenges, such as how to identify the best M2M gateway for a required service and the QoS. This paper proposes a method to select an M2M gateway from a large number of possibilities in order to increase service availability while also obtaining better signal strength for higher QoS.

A combination of software/firmware and embedded hardware is an optimal way to implement a highly secure root of trust. This approach provides a very tight security boundary, depending on implementation, either the entire System on Chip (SoC) or a portion of the SoC. The most secure approach limits the security boundary to a portion of the SoC. Embedded hardware ensures that the important secrets are protected inside the SoC and software/firmware ensures that design is flexible and will enable secure future field updates. Extending trust requires a set of fundamental security features, secure bootstrap, peer authentication, and access control. In all three cases, the root of trust facilitates these features, protecting their processes and sensitive information.

Focus is on deploying cognitive radio technologies (5G) which enables the smart city networks to support interconnected infrastructure elements, to handle big-data from the smart homes, and to be compatible with existing infrastructures. The considered cognitive radio technology is based on pre-coded OFDM which offers the needed flexibility to deal with the key challenges found in the smart home networks. Thus, it is able to overcome the WiFi interferences and the wall penetration losses for a limited power cost. By simulation it has been found that power saving in the range of 10–23 % can be achieved for a small bandwidth cost. Additionally, it has been found that the choice of the smart home gateway location can change its power consumption with 99 %.

At the ‘thing’ level—devices and inter-device network communication—the core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Industrial networks; Internet of Things; Machine to machine; Smart grid; Wireless sensor network","Intelligent buildings; Internet; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Commercial Devices; Embedded platforms; Industrial networks; Intelligent devices; Machine to machines; Network communications; Off-the-shelf components; Smart grid; Gateways (computer networks)","Fisher, R.; Advanced Sensor Networks Research Group, University of Pretoria, Lynwood Road, South Africa; email: rmfisher@cityu.edu.hk",,"MDPI AG",14248220,,,25803706,"English","Sensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928661924

However, a single protocol is not always suitable for both constrained and unconstrained devices. Several solutions to the interoperability issue in the IoT have been proposed, but they neither provide transparent interoperation nor are extensible and configurable enough.

The current state-of-the-art requires application-layer gateways both in software and hardware that provide applicationspecific connectivity to IoT devices. In much the same way that it would be difficult to imagine requiring a new web browser for each website, it is hard to imagine our current approach to IoT connectivity scaling to support the IoT vision. The IoT gateway problem exists in part because today's gateways conflate network connectivity, in-network processing, and user interface functions. We believe that disentangling these functions would improve the connectivity potential for IoT devices. To realize the broader vision, we propose an architecture that leverages the increasingly ubiquitous presence of Bluetooth Low Energy radios to connect IoT peripherals to the Internet. In much the same way that WiFi access points revolutionized laptop utility, we envision that a worldwide deployment of IoT gateways could revolutionize application-agnostic connectivity, thus breaking free from the stove-piped architectures now taking hold. In this paper, we present our proposed architecture, show example applications enabled by it, and explore research challenges in its implementation and deployment.

At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented.

The obvious alternative, wire line, has gained much less attention, perhaps since it is too well known. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient IoT architecture for healthcare applications that leverages clinical and home care scenarios, given their typically fixed, stationary nature, as the mobility of patients is in many cases confined to a room or a building. The architecture is based on intelligent, wired gateways that are power-efficient and low-cost.

Although a single CoAP service provided by a CoAP-enabled device has its own value for its users, the functionality provided by an individual CoAP service is limited. Hence, an efficient method of manipulating a set of CoAP services concurrently and processing their output data is needed. However, existing approaches require users to manually discover services and create mashups. Manual discovery and mashups are quite time-consuming tasks especially in an IoT paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel CoAP Service Gateway (CoAP-SG) as an intermediate network node between a resource-constrained network and the Internet. The CoAP-SG enables users to create a CoAP service mashup automatically through a single HTTP request. In addition, semantic similarity is proposed to select similar services in case there is no exact matchings. Experimental results with a prototype implementation show that the proposed approach is feasible in terms of execution time and scalability. © 2015 IEEE.","automated service mashup; CoAP service gateway; Constrained Application Protocol; Internet of Things","Data handling; Gateways (computer networks); HTTP; Internet; Internet protocols; Reconfigurable hardware; Semantics; Application protocols; Automated services; Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); Intermediate networks; Internet of thing (IOT); Prototype implementations; Resource-constrained network; Service gateway; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509003655,,,"English","IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT - Proc.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964414220

This management can be achieved through the use of gateways, i.e., devices that intermediate wireless communications, minimizing resource consumption of the restrained objects. The communication between gateways and objects can be performed over many architectures. Among these architectures, we highlight the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and the Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA). However, there is a lack of deeper investigations to define which is the best architecture to model the communication between gateways and objects.

In this context, we present a system that enables PHDs to share information in home networks and with the Internet based on a new Internet of Things protocol, namely the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).

The software required for communication can vary widely across different classes of devices. Complete protocol stacks are necessary in some cases, while, in others, the presence of gateways and dedicated network hardware enables the use of little more than a serial driver. In all devices though, the need for communication adds some degree of complexity and, thus, creates additional incentive for using an RTOS. Another factor that could drive RTOS adoption in the IoT is the widespread need for effective power management. The most important factor likely to boost RTOS adoption for IoT devices is time-to-market concerns.",,"Complex networks; Computer operating systems; Embedded systems; Internet; Network protocols; Real time systems; Dedicated networks; Degree of complexity; Different class; Embedded operating systems; Embedded real time operating system; Internet of Things (IOT); IOT applications; Serial drivers; Internet of things","Matt, G.; MicriumCanada",,"Hearst Business Communications",00134953,,ELPOA,,"English","Electron.

This system included several technologies: wireless sensor networks, remote information transmission networks, and the terminal fishery monitoring center. In this system, wireless sensor networks were applied to obtain fishery field data, including vessel position signals, monitoring information of electrofishing, and detection information of fishing vessel overload. Vessel position signals were acquired by NovAtel RTK-L1/L2 global positioning system receiver. Based on the principle of high-frequency pulse electric signal detection in water, the sensing circuit was designed to monitor electrofishing illegal operations. The overload detection was executed through pressure sensor installed on ship's load draft mark, which could transform water pressure to fishing vessel draft, and judge accurately the overload. In addition, wireless sensor networks could normalize these sensor data of different types, detect fishing violations automatically, and transmit them to remote information transmission networks. Each fishing vessel was equipped with a wireless sensor network based on ZigBee. It comprised multiple acquisition nodes, multiple route nodes, and a gateway node. Acquisition nodes and route nodes could gather fishery field data of fishing vessels. As an inter-connected network integration access, the gateway node was connected to remote information transmission networks. Remote information transmission networks comprised the mobile communications network of GPRS (general packet radio service)/GSM (global system for mobile communication) and internet. Fishery field data were transmitted by the mobile communication network and internet, and uploaded to the terminal fishery monitoring center through private data link immediately. The purpose of the terminal fishery monitoring center was to identify fishing vessels on the electronic map, monitor fishing violations, and provide assistance to fishery management. This monitoring center contained 5 modules, which were user administration, location display, illegal alarm, data analysis, and data storage. The module of user administration was applied to the authorization of the user's identity and the maintenance of the system. The field information of fishing vessels could be displayed immediately by the module of location display and illegal alarm. The location database and the illegal case database had also been set up for storage and analysis in monitoring center, in order to query and analyze historical fishery data conveniently. The software system of terminal fishery monitoring center, including LabVIEW2013, ArcGIS Engine 10.2 and SQL server 2008, could provide fishery administrators with a visual image of real-time data monitoring platform. At last, the experiment was conducted on Jialing River in Beibei District, Chongqing Municipality, China. Particularly, in the test on electrofishing monitoring, the sensor was installed on the stern of the small-sized fishing vessel (No. YBY 077). The electronic fishing equipment, with 300 W average power, 100 V voltage effective value and 50 KHz frequency, worked in water at a distance from 6.21 to 1.23 m outside the fishing vessel. And the results demonstrated that the electrofishing monitoring sensor effectively detected fishing illegal operations within 5 m. In another test, 2 fishing vessels (No. YBY 018, No. YBYF 013) were loaded with sandbags in different distribution and different weight, to verify the validity of the overload detection sensor. And the results showed that these sensors could not only correctly distinguish the overload condition, but also accurately judge the uneven load state of fishing vessel. Also this dynamic information monitoring system was tested in Beibei District for more than 2 months (from January to February in 2015), and the hardware and software system could work cooperatively and stably. This dynamic information monitoring system for small-sized inland waterway fishing vessels provides simple and effective monitoring information to the fishery administrators, which is helpful to improve work efficiency and solve some problems of fishery management of inland waters in China. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Storing the data arriving in high volume at IoT gateways or transferring it to back-end clusters for timely processing and real-time response generation is not always feasible, and generally requires considerable overprovisioning of resources. In typical configurations, a computationally capable front-end gateway is available for coordinating the operation of smart devices and for linking them to computation and communication rich back-end infrastructure. It is attractive to harness the computational capabilities in front-end gateways to achieve elasticity of deployment so that the total throughput and response time of IoT solutions can be optimized by intelligent division of labor between devices, front-end gateways, and back-end servers. This paper proposes an Elastic Computing Framework (ECF), an architecture in which programmability of front-end machines is drawn upon to dynamically divide data processing tasks into those that see all of the data but perform simple operations on it, and those that see a transformed subset of the data and extract deep insights from it. This results in lifting the pressure on the network that links the front-and back-ends, and achieves capability adaptive deployment of IoT solutions. In experimental evaluation with one production usage scenario, this approach achieves between six fold and fifty fold reduction in data transferred to back-end clusters, and improves responsiveness by roughly sixteen fold. © 2015 IEEE.","Internet Of Things(IoT); Interoperability; IoT Architecture; Machine-to-Machine; Real-time Analytics","Big data; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Gateways (computer networks); Interoperability; Network architecture; Reconfigurable hardware; Computational capability; Experimental evaluation; Internet of Things (IOT); Iot architectures; Machine to machines; Over provisioning; Real time response; Real-time analytics; Internet of things",,"Liu X.Wang P.Wang Y.Dong M.Hsu R.C.H.Xia F.Deng Y.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509018932,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

It requires robust and energy-efficient sensors, because the devices are placed outdoors, often in harsh conditions, and there is no power outlet in the middle of a corn field. Power efficiency is one of the major themes of the Internet of Things (IoT).

A scheme using Extended Service Set- (ESS-) based architecture is presented to implement the proxy mobile IPv6 protocol, that is, PMIPv6, for IEEE 802.11 infrastructure Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The key signaling packets together with their time sequences for the mobility management in the proposed scheme are proposed. Moreover, the handoff delay in the proposed scheme is derived, through which the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed. Numerical analysis indicates that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms the existing scheme that uses the Basic Service Set (BSS) based architecture in terms of handoff delay in the case when the delay between Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and local mobile anchor (LMA) is relatively large. © 2015 Deqing Zhu et al.",,"Gateways (computer networks); Local area networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Standards; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Basic service sets; Extended service sets; Internet of thing (IOT); Mobile anchors; Mobility management; Portable device; Proxy Mobile IPv6; Wireless fidelities; Internet of things","Zhu, Y.-H.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of TechnologyChina",,"Hindawi Publishing Corporation",15501329,,,,"English","Int.

An Identity Management (IdM) can be applied to easily authenticate a technician that intend to access the appliances from the Internet. However, Internet context is significantly different from IoT, demanding context adaptation to work. Thus, integrate these contexts to allow the authentication on the Internet and provide Single Sign-On (SSO) in IoT is a challenge. The goal is to allow a technician to access an appliance that is not reachable from the Internet, using IdM and without creating a single compromising point in the gateway that links the two contexts.

Low-cost passive RFID tags are replacing traditional barcodes for physical object identification and are heavily used within logistics and trade. They are an essential aspect of identifying physical objects, therefore an integration into the IoT is required. This paper presents a concept, which defines how the EPCIS can be integrated into the IoT extending it to a so called Smart Thing Information System (STIS). The integration follows a two-fold approach. On the one side, the information of the EPCIS is made available for IoT devices and services, by providing a lightweight query interface. On the other side, the information of non-RFID related devices, such as sensors and actuators of home and building automation systems (BAS) are made available to EPCIS. Thus, a seamless integration with building automation systems is possible. The extended system embraces interoperability by resting upon standards such as OBIX and CoAP. We present a case study using a globally testbed that demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed system extension. In addition, a performance analysis is carried out that investigates the scalability impacts and limits of the STIS new interfaces as well as the gateway for BAS. © 2015, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers' data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework's architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework's design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The gateway of internet of things was used for heterogeneous networks access and transmission of data protocol among the networks. In order to realize the unified management of heterogeneous networks that were used for greenhouse environment, an intelligent gateway with Exynos4412 as the core processor was developed, which has high speed operation capability and can be expanded for various communication module interfaces. Correspondingly, an application program worked in the gateway based on Android system was designed, which realized the management process of heterogeneous networks as following: Firstly, on the gateway display interface, user configured the information of the gateway communicating interface, data acquisition unit, and phase description of the sensors data stream. Secondly, the gateway application program established an information configuration file based on XML. Thirdly, after the application program was running again, according to the data stream description in XML configuration file, the gateway program matched the received data stream byte by byte segment in the data receiving tread, then positioned the sensor data in the data stream, parsed and converted the original value to the real value of the monitoring parameter. Fourthly, the data relation between keyword and value was composed to a map and was stored in the SQLite database. Lastly, the data access interface was provided for upper module such as real time data query module and historical data query module. The system was deployed in greenhouse and started running since December 18, 2014, to test three kinds of heterogeneous networks for Zigbee, RS-485 and Wi-Fi. The Zigbee network was used to collect air temperature, air humidity, light intensity, CO2 concentration, soil moisture inside the greenhouse, and data was transmitted to a Zigbee aggregation unit that was linked to the gateway by Serial line. The RS-485 network was used to collect the meteorological information outside the greenhouse such as wind direction, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, rainfall, UVI, light intensity, and data was transmitted to a 485/232 conversion module which linked to the gateway by Serial line. The Wi-Fi network was used to collect the greenhouse image data from the camera, and data was transmitted wirelessly to the Wi-Fi module in the gateway by using a wireless router. In the gateway application program, the heterogeneous networks channel properties and sensors data protocol was not fixed in the software code, but was configured by user on the interface, also the storage and display of monitoring parameters was synchronous with the configuration. Thus, the application program can save developing time when the system was deployed for similar greenhouse environment monitoring or the nodes in the networks were changed for different use. The running results for at least 14 days showed that the intelligent gateway had corresponded the analysis, storage and display of monitoring parameters to the configuration information. Various monitoring parameters of heterogeneous networks data had been stored, and environmental monitoring data can be updated accurately and history data record can be query accurately on the displaying interface of the gateway. The application model of the system was of good stability and can be further extended to more heterogeneous networks. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

For the sake of simplicity and reliability, many middle-ware solutions support homogeneous/single network deployment. However, when the number of device vendors continue to grow, it is inevitable that the system consist of devices having heterogeneous network interfaces. WuKong is an intelligent middle-ware for machine-To-machine, cyberphysical, and Internet-of-Things systems. To support dynamic connectivity and heterogeneous network protocols in the system, Multiple Protocol Transport Network (MPTN) gateway is designed to be a distributed messaging gateway to enable messaging among multiple networks. To leverage the routing capability in existing network protocols, MNTP gateway converts an end-Toend message request to a multiple segment messaging based on network topology available to MNTP gateway. To collect concurrent stream data, MPTN gateway supports data alignment mechanism to label sampling data onto a common time domain. The mechanism adapt a coordinated model to collect concurrent data streams, and convert the sample counter/time on sensor device to time instances on time domain of MPTN gateway. The evaluation results show that the data alignment errors are much less than sampling errors and can be ignored. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Heterogeneous networks; Internet; Internet of things; Network protocols; Reconfigurable hardware; Coordinated modeling; Distributed messaging; Essential features; Evaluation results; Machine to machines; Network deployment; Synchronized clocks; Transport networks; Gateways (computer networks)",,"Yang L.T.Chen J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509002146,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In order to collect data from such devices possibly moving in the Internet, a gateway or relay node that can transfers the data using wide area communication techniques is necessary.

Security and privacy of patients' medical data are crucial for the acceptance and ubiquitous use of IoT in healthcare. Secure authentication and authorization of a remote healthcare professional is the main focus of this work. Due to resource constraints of medical sensors, it is infeasible to utilize conventional cryptography in IoT-based healthcare. In addition, gateways in existing IoTs focus only on trivial tasks without alleviating the authentication and authorization challenges. In the presented architecture, authentication and authorization of a remote end-user is done by distributed smart e-health gateways to unburden the medical sensors from performing these tasks. The proposed architecture relies on the certificate-based DTLS handshake protocol as it is the main IP security solution for IoT. The proposed authentication and authorization architecture is tested by developing a prototype IoT-based healthcare system. The prototype is built of a Pandaboard, a TI SmartRF06 board and WiSMotes. The CC2538 module integrated into the TI board acts as a smart gateway and the WisMotes act as medical sensor nodes. The proposed architecture is more secure than a state-of-the-art centralized delegation-based architecture because it uses a more secure key management scheme between sensor nodes and the smart gateway. Furthermore, the impact of DoS attacks is reduced due to the distributed nature of the architecture. Our performance evaluation results show that compared to the delegation-based architecture, the proposed architecture reduces communication overhead by 26% and communication latency from the smart gateway to the end-user by 16%. © 2015 The Authors.

There is a need to balance the appetite for data with the constraints and capabilities of the supporting physical infrastructure. This paper presents a management framework for wireless sensor networks within IoT ecosystems. This framework through cooperation and negotiation can lead to the creation of multiple virtual networks deployed over the same physical infrastructure to share resources, context, insight etc., in order to meet dynamic service requirements.

This paper examines, from an energy consumption viewpoint, some options for deploying a network of 'Things' and connecting them through their gateway into the Internet or a corporate network. It focuses specifically on the access network from the customer premises to the central office and the implications for this network of carrying uplinkdominant IoT traffic. The power consumption of a number of potential access network technologies and architectures is modelled for a range of IoT traffic and background network traffic levels. It is shown that shared corporate Wi-Fi network with PON backhaul can be the most energy efficient option if the Wi-Fi background traffic level is modest. Otherwise, a 4G Wireless (LTE) access is also very efficient if the site IoT traffic level is low-up to around 100 kb/s. At higher rates a GPON access provides the most energy efficient solution. © 2015 IEEE.","access network technologies; energy efficiency; internet of things; power consumption; power efficient","Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Passive optical networks; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Access network; Background traffic; Central offices; Corporate networks; Customer premise; Energy efficient; Network traffic; Power efficient; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467363051,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Recent research in IoT context also points to the use of smartphones as sensor gateways highlighting the importance of data processing at the network edge. In either case, when a smart phone is used as a compute resource or a sensor gateway, the corresponding tasks must be executed in addition to the user’s normal activities on the device without affecting the user experience. In this paper, we propose a framework that can act as an enabler of such features by classifying the availability of system resources like CPU, memory, network usage based on applications running on an Android phone. We show that, such app-based classifications are user-specific and app usage varies with different handsets, leading to different classifications. We further show that irrespective of such variation in classification, distinct patterns exist for all users with available opportunity to schedule external tasks, without affecting user experience. Based on the next to-be-used applications, we output a predicted set of system resources. The resource levels along with handset architecture may be used to estimate worst case execution time for external jobs. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2015.","IoT; Machine learning; Mobile cloud computing; Resource utilisation; Sensor data; Smart phone; Usage prediction","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; E-learning; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet of things; Learning systems; Smartphones; Telephone sets; User interfaces; Compute resources; IoT; Recent researches; Resource usage patterns; Resource utilisation; Sensor data; Smart Mobile Phones; Worst-case execution time; Mobile cloud computing","Mukherjee, A.; Innovation Labs, Tata Consultancy ServicesIndia; email: mukherjee.arijit@tcs.com","Jara A.J.Pasher E.Bendersky G.Mandler B.Rodrigues J.J.P.C.Dekel E.Vieriu R.-L.Giaffreda R.","Springer Verlag",18678211,9783319196558,,,"English","Lect.

We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show Wi-Fi Backscatter's feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and demonstrate the first communication link between an RF-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices including Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys Routers, and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters.

These devices, however, may not be handled efficiently by the current wireless communication networks, which were not designed for frequent small data packets and simultaneous massive accesses. In this paper, a novel aggregator based MTC communication architecture is proposed, where the aggregators function as MTC gateways towards the cellular network, combining connections of masive devices into single connection. Correspondingly, based on the aggregated packet characteristics and data relay modes, the aggregators will request for aggregator specific radio resource control (RRC) mechanism. Simply put, always available connectivity is desired for contiguous packets with low latency, while coordinated transmission among multiple aggregators are preferred for packets with larger delay tolerance. Through various analysis and numerical results, MTC communication with aggregators are expected to bring much improved signaling efficiency, thus handling the gigantic pressure on 5G network design from the potential trillions of MTC devices. © 2014 IEEE.","Data to signaling ratio; Machine type communications; Radio resource control; Service aggregation; Signaling reduction","Internet of things; Telecommunication networks; Wearable sensors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Data to signaling ratio; Machine type communications; Radio resource control; Service aggregation; Signaling reduction; Radio communication",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479941469,,,"English","IEEE/CIC Int.

The goal of researcher is, in addition to the omnipresence, to enable mobility of smart products. In the Internet mobility, identifiers should be assigned stable and not take into account the ever changing topology of the Internet. Locators should instead be very similar to the topology to be effective to reach a host. The separation of the identifier and locator is a consensus point (both feasible and desirable) of the Working Group RRG (Routing Research Group) of the IRTF for mobility and multihoming. Host Identity Protocol (HIP) proposes a new architecture based on the principle of distinguishing the identity of a node (Identifier) and the means to locate it (Locator). A central system is proposed by combining multiple wireless gateways/interfaces. This combination forms almost a backbone around the mobile laboratory. This system acts as hypervisor and takes the separation of the identifier and locator into account by implementing the HIP protocol mechanisms. To ensure the mobility of the mobile laboratory, a global identifier or HI (Host Identifier) is assigned to the system and multiple locators are associated to each wireless gateway/interface by mapping the HI to provide the multi-homing. A Rendezvous system is used to locate the mobile laboratory via these locators. HI does not contain topological information. For example, if the hypervisor switches from Wi-Fi to a 3G, HI should not change and a mobile laboratory locator changes while ensuring the maintenance of existing sessions, as if the mobile laboratory had not budged. © 2015 IEEE.","HIP; Mobile Laboratory; Mobility; Multihoming; Wireless gateways/interfaces","Carrier mobility; Chemical laboratories; Hot isostatic pressing; Internet; Laboratories; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Topology; World Wide Web; Architecture-based; Global identifiers; Host identity protocol; Interworking gateway; Mobile laboratories; Multi-homing; Topological information; Wireless gateways; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479981717,,,"English","World Symp.

Therefore, the services they offer may have to be accessed through gateways. Typically this requires that the gateway is trusted to store and transmit the data. However, if the gateway cannot be trusted, the data needs to be protected end-to-end. One way of achieving end-to-end security is to perform a key exchange, and secure the subsequent messages using the derived shared secrets. However, when the constrained nodes are sleepy this key exchange may have to be done in a delayed fashion. We present a novel way of utilizing the gateway in key exchange, without the possibility of it influencing or compromising the exchanged keys. The paper investigates the applicability of existing protocols for this purpose. Furthermore, due to a possible need for protocol translations, application layer use of the exchanged keys is examined. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Ad hoc networks; Network protocols; Network security; Power management (telecommunication); Telecommunication networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Application layers; End to end; End-to-end security; Key exchange; Protocol translations; Shared secrets; Sleep state; Smart devices; Gateways (computer networks)","Kannisto, J.; Tampere University of TechnologyFinland","Papavassiliou S.Pineda M.G.Lloret J.Westphall C.B.Ruehrup S.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783662463376,,,"English","Lect.

This paper proposes a new system based on 1-hop clustering to reduce the number of VANET communications in dense road traffic scenarios while maintaining the security of communications by combining public-key with secret-key cryptography. The proposed distributed clustering architecture creates a dynamic virtual backbone in the network, formed by Cluster-Heads and cluster-gateways, so that these nodes are responsible for the efficient message propagation in the network. The main aim of the described architecture is to balance both stability of backbone connections and cost/efficiency trade-off. Full definitions of all the architecture procedures are provided, including a cluster-head selection algorithm based on a version of the independent set problem and a secret-key agreement scheme that uses the generalized Diffie-Hellman protocol.

The gathered data are delivered mainly to sinks or gateways that become the endpoints where applications can retrieve and process such data. However, applications would also expect from a WSN an event-driven operational model, so that they can be notified whenever occur some specific environmental changes instead of continuously analyzing the data provided periodically. In either operational model, WSNs represent a collection of interconnected objects, as outlinedby the Internet of Things. Additionally, in order to fulfill the Internet of Things principles, Wireless Sensor Networks must have a virtual representation that allows indirect access to their resources, a model that should also include the virtualization of event sources in a WSN. Thus, in this paper a model for a virtual representation of event sources in a WSN is proposed. They are modeled as internet resources that are accessible by any internet application, following an Internet of Things approach. The model has been tested in a real implementation where a WSN has been deployed in an open neighborhood environment.

They are viewed as a key enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous applications, like mobile healthcare, telemetry, or intelligent transport systems. We survey existing work on mobile M2M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M2M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network. We conclude that, in order for their use to the feasible in terms of a normal depletion time of a smartphone’s battery, it is a good advice to maximize the collection of data necessary to be transmitted from nearby sensors, and maximize the intervals between transmissions.

While these platforms have been found to be useful on their own, many IoT scenarios require the coordination of computing resources across the network: on servers, gateways and devices themselves. To address this, we explore how to extend existing IoT data flow platforms to create a system suitable for execution on a range of run time environments, toward supporting distributed IoT programs that can be partitioned between servers, gateways and devices. Eventually we aim to automate the distribution of data flows using appropriate distribution mechanism, and optimization heuristics based on participating resource capabilities and constraints imposed by the developer.

Several factors have contributed to this, but the potential for application of WSNs in almost every aspect of day-to-day life is the predominant one. This type of networks has been developed using proprietary solutions instead of standard solutions. More recently, the importance of standards motivated the use of IETF standards in WSNs, making the Internet integration easier. However, more efforts are necessary in order to provide a full integration. The WSNs use mainly IPv6 protocol, but the IPv4 is the predominant one in the Internet. As a consequence, IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms must be provided to allow the interaction between all Internet connected devices independently of the supported IP version. It is also critical to provide a standard application interface to make easier the application development and independently of the hardware platform used. The RESTfull Web services can provide this standard interface. So, combine RESTfull Web services with IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms can increase the WSN services dissemination. The transition mechanisms and the REST Web services are supported in the gateway in order to save the wireless sensor device resources’. The smartphone with Internet connectivity can also be the drive to the WSNs growth, because user-friendly applications can be used to retrieve and collect sensed data. This paper proposes a solution based on REST web services to permit the interaction between a mobile application and the IPv6 compliant WSN. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","6LoWPAN; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor network","Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Social networking (online); Ubiquitous computing; Web services; Websites; Wireless sensor networks; 6LoWPAN; Application development; Application interfaces; Internet connectivity; IPv4 to IPv6 transition; Proprietary solutions; Transition mechanism; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Internet protocols","Rodrigues, J.J.P.C.; Instituto de Telecomunicações, University of Beira InteriorPortugal",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",09296212,,WPCOF,,"English","Wireless Pers Commun",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027944379

There has been a shift in research towards integrating both concepts, considering the Internet of Things as representing the future of computing and communications. However, the efficient combination and management of heterogeneous things or devices in the ambient intelligence domain is still a tedious task, and it presents crucial challenges. Therefore, to appropriately manage the inter-connection of diverse devices in these systems requires: (1) specifying and efficiently implementing the devices (e.g., as services); (2) handling and verifying their heterogeneity and composition; and (3) standardizing and managing their data, so as to tackle large numbers of systems together, avoiding standalone applications on local servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a platform to manage the integration and behavior-aware orchestration of heterogeneous devices as services, stored and accessed via the cloud, with the following contributions: (i) we describe a lightweight model to specify the behavior of devices, to determine the order of the sequence of exchanged messages during the composition of devices; (ii) we define a common architecture using a service-oriented standard environment, to integrate heterogeneous devices by means of their interfaces, via a gateway, and to orchestrate them according to their behavior; (iii) we design a framework based on cloud computing technology, connecting the gateway in charge of acquiring the data from the devices with a cloud platform, to remotely access and monitor the data at run-time and react to emergency situations; and (iv) we implement and generate a novel cloud-based IoT platform of behavior-aware devices as services for ambient intelligence systems, validating the whole approach in real scenarios related to a specific ambient assisted living application. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ambient assisted living; Ambient intelligence; Cloud computing; Devices; Gateway; Internet of Things; Sensors; Service-oriented; Services","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Sensors; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Ambient assisted living; Ambient intelligence; Devices; Service Oriented; Services; Information management","Cubo, J.; Universidad de Málaga, Departamento de Lenguajes y Ciencias de la Computación, Campus de Teatinos, 29071 Málaga, Spain; email: cubo@lcc.uma.es",,"MDPI AG",14248220,,,25093343,"English","Sensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905493158

Bluetooth is suitable when connecting a device to a mobile phone, which is a gateway to the Internet. WiFi is a natural fi rst-choice for a lot of home IoT-based devices when a connection to the Internet is required, because it can provide access through the home's router.

However, until now the format of IoT ID is not globally unified due to all kinds of reasons and thus in the IoT world there are even thousands of types of IoT ID (such as EPC code in USA, uCode in Japan, CPC code in China etc.). Due to the heterogeneity of IoT ID, it becomes the key point of resolving an IoT ID to the information referring to it (just as resolving the domain name to IP address) to at first determine the standard that the given IoT ID belongs to. Towards this issue, an extraction mechanism of IoT ID characteristic is proposed where three kinds of IoT ID characteristics, namely length, value range and special algorithm, are captured from the IoT ID standards. Based on these IoT ID characteristics, a fast IoT ID recognition algorithm is proposed to highly reduce the times of characteristic matching. Then a prototype system is built based on the above algorithm and the experiment results demonstrate that the IoT ID recognition algorithm has a high recognition ratio and low computational complexity. © 2014 IEEE.","ID; IoT; Recognition; Rule","Algorithms; Application programs; Internet; Multimedia systems; Social networking (online); Design and implementations; ID; Internet of Things (IOT); IoT; Low computational complexity; Multimedia content and applications; Recognition; Rule; Internet of things",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479957262,,,"English","Proc. - Web Inf.

Another advantage of such edge-processing is that these networks can become autonomous in the sense that users can directly query the network via any node in the network and are not required to connect to gateways or retrieve data via long range communications. Dragon is a scheme that efficiently identifies nodes that can reply to user requests based on static criteria that either describes that node or its data and provides the ability to near-optimally route queries or actuation control messages to those nodes. Dragon is scalable and agile as it does not require any central point orchestrating the search.

As such Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) play a vital role in such an environment, since they cover a wide application field. Such interconnection can be seen from the aspect of a remote user who can access a single desired sensor node from the WSN without the necessity of firstly connecting with a gateway node (GWN). This paper focuses on such an environment and proposes a novel user authentication and key agreement scheme for heterogeneous ad hoc wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme enables a remote user to securely negotiate a session key with a general sensor node, using a lightweight key agreement protocol. The proposed scheme ensures mutual authentication between the user, sensor node, and the gateway node (GWN), although the GWN is never contacted by the user. The proposed scheme has been adapted to the resource-constrained architecture of the WSN, thus it uses only simple hash and XOR computations. Our proposed scheme tackles these risks and the challenges posed by the IOT, by ensuring high security and performance features. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT. © 2012 IEEE.","Big data; climate change; cloud computing; e-Science; enterprise systems; environmental monitoring and management; geoinformatics; industrial informatics; Internet of Things (IoT); System integration","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Cloud computing; Ecology; Gateways (computer networks); Geographic information systems; Information management; Internet; Middleware; Network layers; Research; Water resources; Web services; Websites; Big datum; e-Science; Enterprise system; Environmental Monitoring; Geo-informatics; Industrial informatics; Internet of Things (IOT); System integration; Environmental management","Fang, S.; LREIS, IGSNRR, CAS, Beijing 100101, China; email: fsfno1@163.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The latter configuration refers mainly to system parameters of the data-collecting gateways, e.g., polling intervals, capture intervals, encryption schemes, used protocols etc. However, re-configuring the platform appropriately upon changes of the system context or the operator targets is currently not taking place. This happens because of the complexity or unawareness of the synergies between system configurations and various aspects of the Big Data-handling IoT platform, but also because of the human resources that an efficient re-configuration would require. This paper presents an auto-configuration solution based on interpretable configuration suggestions, focusing on the algorithms for computing the mentioned suggested configurations. Five such algorithms are contributed, while a thorough evaluation reveals which of these algorithms should be used in different operation scenarios in order to achieve high fulfillment of the operator's targets. © 2014 IEEE.","autonomic; configuration; gateway; IoT; M2M; self-management","Algorithms; Data handling; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet of things; autonomic; configuration; IoT; M2M; Self management; Big data","Papageorgiou, A.; NEC Laboratories EuropeGermany","Chen P.Chen P.Jain H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479950577,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In the traditional smart home architecture, the Memory and CPU of the Sensor Nodes are idle for most of the time, and these resources were not used in an efficient manner.

However, currently there is a gap between data acquisition and processing, usually bridged by gateway based approaches that integrate the devices and forward the data to Clouds in order to be processed. Integration is often static and limited to a certain application domain, which the gateway is able to support. In addition, processing does not consider the compute- and storage resources already made available by the growing amount of smart devices, like smart TVs or smart phones.

The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing 'feed-in feed-out' entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured 'gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an 'Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. 'In-action' and 'On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters. Through dissemination of the concept at this early phase of development in establishing the resource, an open invitation for peers and related interested parties to critique, advise, and otherwise contribute toward optimal development and wide impact is offered. © 2014 IEEE.","cloud-based collaboration resource; communication; healthcare; Internet of Things; rehabilitation; therapy","Behavioral research; Communication; Gateways (computer networks); Health care; Internet of things; Patient rehabilitation; Cloud-based; Infrastructure resources; Intervention methods; Optimal development; Recommendation strategies; Scientific articles; therapy; Treatment outcomes; Patient treatment",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781479951567,,,"English","Int.

As such, creating mobile applications that dynamically discover and integrate ambient functionality across multiple vertical markets remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel integration technique that enables commodity mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones) to mediate control messaging between incompatible Smart Devices situated in the user's environment. The approach enables a variety of control capabilities and protocol translation services to be dynamically installed into a user's mobile device on-demand using plug-ins. The approach features an intuitive ""Tap to Interact"" workflow that allows a user to tap nearby Smart Devices with a smartphone to install required interaction plug-ins and automatically ""wire"" them together in interesting and potentially unforeseen ways. In our demonstration, we show how this approach enables a Sphero Robotic Ball to be utilized as a physical interface for controlling media playback on an Apple TV, interacting with networked-enabled lighting equipment, and flying a Parrot AR Drone helicopter - by leveraging a commodity smartphone as a plug-and-play Smart Gateway between mutually incompatible devices.

In this study, we investigate the performance of asynchronous TCP connections from multiple WiFi clients to a sensor node on WSN. We model the traffic over WSN gateway as M/M/1 queue and present the results of comprehensive simulation tests for performance of TCP connections in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. The results reveal that the gateway can achieve reasonable Round Trip Times up to 80 simultaneous connections to WSN when WiFi Packet Error Rate is less than 0.2. © 2014 IEEE.","Gateway; IoT; TCP; WSN","Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Transmission control protocol; Ubiquitous computing; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Internet of Things (IOT); IoT; Packet error rates; Reliable communication; Remote management; Simulation tests; TCP; WSN; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15253511,9781479930838,,,"English","IEEE Wireless Commun.

Although we observe a converged view from the various application domains that their gateways should adopt IP, it is clear that the path to full adoption is long. The gateways may impose very specific requirements of security, resilience to failures, ease of maintenance and upgrade. We present the design goals of an enhanced architecture for the IoT that can reduce such concerns, paving the way for faster adoption of IP in the IoT. We argue that the functions one needs to perform in IoT networks of various application domains can be summarised in a small group of basic request-response operations, which traverse gateways and act as the transport layer. We describe how more complex functions, abstracted into server-based processes, can then be executed by the basic transport operations. With this approach we aim to reduce the technology-specific functions of IoT gateways, which now even become transparent, at best. © 2014 IEEE.",,,,,"IEEE Computer Society",,,,,"English","IEEE World Forum Internet Things, WF-IoT",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900421103

MUSE integrates WSN with IMS OSE framework to enable the WSN services to be operable and manageable. Also sensor web enablement (SWE) framework is adopted to shield the heterogeneity of different WSNs. MUSE consists of two key entities - MUSE Enabler and MUSE Gateway. On the one hand, the architecture promotes the node manageability and enriches the diversity of high level task planning flexibility. On the other hand, the architecture extends the telecom context-aware service and realizes service operability and network scalability.

The security algorithms are based on a local key renewal (without any exchange in air), performed just considering the local clock time.

Data centric RESfFul services, as previously mainly known in web environments, established themselves as a second paradigm complementing functional WSDL-based SOA. In the Internet of Things, and in particular when talking about sensor motes, the Constraint Application Protocol (CoAP) is currently in the focus of both research and industry. In the enterprise world a protocol called OData (Open Data Proto-col) is becoming the future RESTful data access standard. To integrate sensor motes seamlessly into enterprise networks, an embedded OData implementation on top of CoAP is desirable, not requiring an intermediary gateway device. In this paper we introduce and evaluate an embedded OData implementation. We evaluate the OData protocol in terms of performance and energy consumption, considering different data encodings, and compare it to a pure CoAP implementation.

Due to the limitation of original OSGi in sharing services among different nodes, a distributed lightweight middleware structure is proposed based on OSGi. In this distributed OSGi structure, various kinds of functions provided by networked devices are abstracted to services. So that we can take advantage of SOA to manage all networked nodes/devices using services form for decoupling. Single service provided by nodes/devices may only have limited function, and networked devices have mobility and endurance ability limitation, etc. In order to adapt to dynamically changed network and application requirements, a service composition mechanism named DscGOM is designed. DscGOM includes service composition path choosing mechanism and service redirection mechanism. The experimental results show that DscGOM mechanism can be faster and more effective than traditional method, which generates the composition path of services to satisfy the dynamic network demand. When a network device dies or exits unexpectedly, the mechanism can quickly get an alternative composition path and restore the execution.","Composition; Middleware; Open service gateway initiative (OSGi); Service; Service oriented architecture (SOA)","Chemical analysis; Information services; Middleware; Quality of service; Sensors; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Application requirements; Development process; Dynamic service composition; Internet of Things (IOT); Lightweight middleware; Open service gateway initiatives; Service; Service compositions; Dynamics","Luo, J.; School of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China; email: juanluo@hnu.edu.cn",,"Science Press",10001239,,JYYFE,,"Chinese","Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896058184

These changes are growing exponentially and network management is becoming increasingly difficult, be it in smart energy/transport/cities or in big enterprises. The diverse nature of applications, devices, mobility of the endpoints has challenged IT to look beyond conventional applications for effective security policies, quality of service and performance. This paper describes how the emerging technology-Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be leveraged to provide scalable solutions in this diverse and rapidly changing landscape, reducing both capex and opex. Two use cases, SDN enabled IoT gateways and eNodeB, are covered in this paper. These use cases demonstrate how SDN can be effectively used to address the challenges faced by service providers/IT in managing the dynamic nature of today's networks. These solutions and other such services with help of North Bound APIs can be used in areas like wireless networks, data centers, service providers, enterprise gateways and other such deployments where there is a need to dynamically program networks to make them agile, smarter and faster. © 2014 IEEE.","Cloud; IoT; Performance; Quality of Service; Security; Software Defined Networks","Clouds; Distributed computer systems; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Mobile devices; Network management; Quality of service; Telecommunication services; Ubiquitous computing; Emerging technologies; IoT; Mobile smart devices; Performance; Security; Software defined networking (SDN); Software-defined networkings; Software-defined networks; Internet of things","Tadinada, V.R.; Freescale SemiconductorsIndia",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479943586,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams. © 2014 IEEE.","iot; medical applications; palcom; rtc; webrtc","Biomedical equipment; Computer system firewalls; Home networks; Hospitals; Internet of things; Medical applications; Personal communication systems; Wi-Fi; Gateway services; Hospital networks; iot; Medical Devices; palcom; rtc; webrtc; Wi Fi networks; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479943586,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Today, each device downloads updates individually from a software provider distribution server. Unfortunately, this approach does not scale to large systems with billions of devices where the network bandwidth of the server and the local Internet gateway become bottlenecks. Cache-enabled Network (CN) services (either proprietary, as Akamai, or open Content-Distribution Networks) can reduce these bottlenecks. However, they do not offer security guarantees against potentially untrusted CN providers that try to threaten the confidentiality of the updates or the privacy of the users. In this paper, we propose Updaticator, the first protocol for software updates over Cache-enabled Networks that is scalable to billions of concurrent device updates while being secure against malicious networks. We evaluate our proposal considering Named-Data Networking, a novel instance of Cache-enabled overlay Networks. Our analysis and experimental evaluation show that Updaticator removes the bottlenecks of individual device-update distribution, by reducing the network load at the distribution server: from linear in the number of devices to a constant, even if billions of devices are requesting updates. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art individual device-update mechanisms, the download time with Updaticator is negligible, due to local caching. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","attribute-based Encryption; cache-enabled Network; internet of Things; secure Updates Distribution; software Updates","Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Overlay networks; Security systems; Attribute-based encryptions; Download time; Experimental evaluation; Internet gateway; Network bandwidth; Secure software; Secure updates; Software updates; Network security","Ambrosin, M.; University of PaduaItaly; email: Ambrosin@math.unipd.it",,"Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319112022,,,"English","Lect.

We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show Wi-Fi Backscatter's feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and demonstrate the first communication link between an RF-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices including Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys Routers, and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters. We believe that this new capability can pave the way for the rapid deployment and adoption of RF-powered devices and achieve ubiquitous connectivity via nearby mobile devices that are Wi-Fi enabled. © 2014 ACM.","backscatter; energy harvesting; internet of things; wireless","Backscattering; Convolutional codes; Energy harvesting; Internet; Internet of things; Mobile devices; Radio; Television broadcasting; Communication rate; Hardware prototype; Internet connectivity; Rapid deployments; RF sources; RFID readers; Small devices; TV broadcast; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450328364,,,"English","SIGCOMM - Proc.

Distributed Ambient Intelligence (AmI) applications, such as remote monitoring and control services, would become possible if Internet connectivity of WSANs is achieved. However, realization of such applications remains challenging with three major obstacles. First, the homogeneity of embedded sensor and actuator nodes and hence homogeneous networks prevents seamless information flow and service provision. Second, current WSAN technology has limited support for Internet connectivity. Protocol conversion with heavy overhead is required on a more powerful gateway device. Third, there are no common interoperable interfaces between different WSAN standards which has become a barrier to heterogeneous WSAN applications. This paper introduces a design for an integrated IP compatible, heterogeneous WSAN composed of the University of Auckland's AWSAM and Oracle's Sun SPOT nodes.

The platform has been conceived in order to minimize power consumption, during all the phases of data acquisition, sampling, and compression, with an efficient and performing communication protocol, with extended transmission range and radio coverage optimization. Sensor nodes have been provided with energy harvesting facilities, to avoid any need for direct power supply or battery replacement. The resulting nodes are consequently autonomous, easy to locate and relocate, and scalable. A further work has been done to minimize dimensions and costs, in order to deploy capillary installations. Furthermore, thanks to the work done from the side of the channel optimization, it has been possible to acquire not only standard environmental parameters, but also high definition pictures. Images of plants, trees, as well as fruits and leaves are taken every hour, and forwarded to a central gateway, interfaced with the Internet. A team of agronomists and biologists checks the state of the cultivation from remote, providing the farmer with continuous assistance at a reasonable cost. This is extremely important in Developing Countries, taking into account that in those locations experts cannot reach the fields and cannot provide the farmer with specialized, continuous consultancy, both for economical and logistic reasons. In a global scenario, where new diseases arise rapidly and continuously, the remote assistance provided by an expert can minimize farmer's risks to loose his harvest and reduce his revenues. The set of environmental parameters, together with the visual collection of cultivation conditions, is useful also to generate a culture database, particularly useful in developing regions, where there is almost never historical recorded trace, in particular about possible associated diseases and infections. Last but not least, the platform allows a significant improvement of the sustainability. Thanks to the assistance of the agronomist, the farmer can minimize the use of pesticides and chemicals, as well as reducing the number of additional treatments, resulting in significant advantages, in terms of production costs and organic quality. © 2014 IEEE.","Intelligent agriculture; Internet of Things; Wireless Sensor Networks","Agriculture; Costs; Cultivation; Data acquisition; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet of things; Organic chemicals; Plants (botany); Radio transmission; Risk perception; Sensor nodes; Sustainable development; Additional treatment; Battery replacements; Channel optimization; Cultivation conditions; Developing regions; Environmental parameter; Sustainable agriculture; Transmission ranges; Wireless sensor networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479971930,,,"English","Proc.

In this chapter, we introduce RPL-6LBR, a 6LoWPAN border router that addresses mission-critical deployments through redundancy. The chapter discusses how existing standards may be leveraged to enable redundant border router synchronization, while identifying certain of their shortcomings. We also propose innovative network architectures incorporating multiple border routers, which deal with redundancy and node mobility without requiring any synchronization among the border routers. We implement the proposed RPL-6LBR in the Contiki operating system and report on this implementation through trials on a small-scale testbed and simulator.

Some of them may need to communicate with each other and with Internet gateways (border routers) over multi-hop links. While most IoT scenarios assume that for this purpose devices use energy-efficient IEEE 802.15.4 radios, there are use cases where IEEE 802.11 is preferred despite its potentially higher energy consumption. We extend the IEEE 802.11 power saving mode (PSM), which allows WLAN devices to enter a low-power doze state to save energy, with a traffic announcement scheme that facilitates multi-hop communication. The scheme propagates traffic announcements along multi-hop paths to ensure that all intermediate nodes remain awake to receive and forward the pending data frames with minimum latency. Our simulation results show that the proposed Multi-Hop PSM (MH-PSM) improves both end-to-end delay and doze time compared to the standard PSM; therefore, it may optimize WLAN to meet the networking requirements of IoT devices. MH-PSM is practical and software-implementable since it does not require changes to the parts of the IEEE 802.11 medium access control that are typically implemented on-chip. We implemented MH-PSM as a part of a WLAN driver for Contiki OS, which is an operating system for resource-constrained IoT devices, and we demonstrated its efficiency experimentally. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Not all of these devices will use the same wireless technology for communication and hence it will be very hard for them to exchange control and data messages.

Moreover, since, nowadays, mobile devices are used to manage many aspects of people's lives, the capability to control and manage Smart Homes through them will become a primary requirement. Unfortunately, the technologies for Smart Homes are often not interoperable among them and the implementation of mobile applications dedicated to these technologies is quite hard for non tech-savvy users. So, in this paper, we propose a flexible approach that allows to efficiently manage, through an Android terminal, a building automation system composed of heterogeneous smart devices. Our solution is based on the capability to semantically describe both the application structure and the device functionalities. Leveraging such a description, the GUI and the business logic of the application is automatically built and configured without any technical and programming knowledge. Moreover, an easily-extensible multi-protocol gateway is integrated in the application, so as providing a transparent access to the heterogeneous underlying technologies. The effectiveness of the proposal is evaluated through a real use case in which heterogeneous devices are involved. © 2014 FESB, University of Split.","Android; Building Automation; CoAP; IoT; KNX; Smart Gateway","Automation; Drug products plants; Enterprise resource planning; Gateways (computer networks); Intelligent buildings; Knowledge management; Mobile devices; Android; Building automation; CoAP; IoT; KNX; Android (operating system)",,"Rozic N.Begusic D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9789532900521,,,"English","Int.

The bio-patch design consists of a single chip solution based on the RF430FRL152H device from Texas Instruments.

It is envisaged that the technology will create a network of smart devices and things to an unprecedented extent, far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today. This unprecedented number of interconnected smart devices is likely to generate an unforeseen volume of data of different types, ready for analysis. The smartness of the Intelligent Infrastructures will depend on effective execution of various analytical algorithms on this accumulated dataset which forms the crux of the IoT paradigm. As of now, researchers rely on cloud-based paradigms to analyse the data in a data-parallel fashion, where analyses take place in large data centres comprised of large number of servers. Apart from the servers, there is a huge pool of relatively unused pool of computing resources in form of smart devices in and around our homes, such as mobile phones, home energy gateways, play-stations etc., which we collectively call edge devices. It is our belief that this pool of resources, if used in the right manner, can contribute to a large extent to effective and successful analysis of the data-set generated by the ubiquitous sensors, leading to a proper realization of the Intelligent Infrastructure paradigm, and we call this approach ANGELS computing. In this paper, we describe a framework which allows remote execution of programs within mobile devices and thus can act as one of the building blocks for the IoT paradigm.

Such huge number of SObjs may lead the Internet of Things (IoT) to face severe network conditions, in terms of network congestion and large delays. Thus, the management of SObjs is fundamental to avoid future IoT network problems. In such a management, network boxes, also called gateways, have been configured to manage SObjs with software updates or reconfiguration followed by a warm start. However, gateways configuration become soon outdated because SObjs join and leave the network quite frequently. Therefore, we propose an approach called MbDSAS to reconfigure gateways without the need of a software updating or patching to manage and detect SObjs and deal with the dynamicity of the IoT network. An evaluation of MbDSAS was performed through an airport modeled scenario. In addition, MbDSAS was experimentally tested to be qualified as a management solution to IoT scenarios and to determine the best performance combination of technologies to implement MbDSAS. © 2013 IEEE.","Internet of Things; Management by Delegation; Network architecture; Network management; Smart objects","Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Management by delegations; Network boxes; Network condition; Network congestions; Smart objects; Software updates; Internet; Management; Network architecture; Network management; Gateways (computer networks)","Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande Do sul (UFRGS), Postal Code 15.064, 91.501-970 - Porto Alegre -RS, Brazil",,,07303157,,PSICD,,"English","Proc Int Comput Software Appl Conf",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891300158

It is a variant of the IETF-standardized Host Identity Protocol (HIP) with a refined protocol design that targets performance improvements of the original HIP protocol. To stay compatible with existing protocol extensions, the HIP DEX specification thereby aims at preserving the general HIP architecture and protocol semantics. As a result, HIP DEX inherits the verbose HIP packet structure and currently does not consider the available potential to tailor the transmission overhead to constrained IoT environments. In this paper, we present Slimfit, a novel compression layer for HIP DEX. Most importantly, Slimfit i) preserves the HIP DEX security guarantees, ii) allows for stateless (de-)compression at the communication end-points or an on-path gateway, and iii) maintains the flexible packet structure of the original HIP protocol. Moreover, we show that Slimfit is also directly applicable to the original HIP protocol. Our evaluation results indicate a maximum compression ratio of 1.55 for Slimfit-compressed HIP DEX packets. Furthermore, Slimfit reduces HIP DEX packet fragmentation by 25 % and thus further decreases the transmission overhead for lossy network links. Finally, the compression of HIP DEX packets leads to a reduced processing time at the network layers below Slimfit.

However, real-world ambient artifacts often adopt proprietary and/or non-Web protocols, making them invisible to Web search engines and inaccessible to conventional Web agents. Smart Gateways have been proposed as a way to ""Web-enable"" proprietary ambient artifacts through intermediary proxy nodes, however, the requisite infrastructure is difficult to deploy at Web scale. To address such challenges, we are developing Ambient Dynamix (Dynamix): a plug-and-play context framework for mobile devices, which enables Web agents to interoperate with non-Web ambient artifacts - directly from the browser. In this paper, we describe how Dynamix can be used to transform the user's device into an ad-hoc Smart Gateway in-situ, enabling Web applications (in the device's browser) to seamlessly interact with non-Web ambient artifacts in the physical environment. We describe an operational prototype implementation, which enables Web apps to discover and control nearby UPnP and AirPlay media devices uniformly.

Today's WSNs normally use dedicated gateways to bridge sensors and IP networks. The installation and maintenance of such a WSN infrastructure are expensive and non-scalable. As the number of smart phone users grows exponentially every year, a powerful mobile computing platform could be used as an alternative WSN infrastructure, which is ubiquitous and scalable. This paper studies the major challenges of using mobile phones as spontaneous gateways of WSNs in IoT systems. The challenges include (1) matching the throughput of mobile phone gateways and sensor data rate at hotspot locations, (2) securing sensor data access and (3) providing accounting records of gateway the service offered by mobile phones. In this paper, we show that using a name-based future Internet architecture (FIA), such as Mobility First, these challenges can be overcome effectively though its native networking layer functions. A proof-of-concept prototype system demonstrates the feasibility of proposed solution.

Not all of these devices will use the same wireless technology for communication and hence it will be very hard for them to exchange control and data messages. Moreover, different wireless technology standards are being used nowadays in many applications such as Bluetooth, WiFi, WiMAX etc. Each technology has a different stack of protocols, medium access control and encoding mechanisms dictating the way it works, operates and technical specifications. Each technology was proposed, developed and standardized to serve specific needs and applications. For example, Bluetooth standard was developed to interconnect small number of devices available within short distances from each other. WiFi was standardized to provide stations with wireless network connectivity through TCP/IP stack. Devices with same wireless technology can connect together to exchange control and data messages. With the increase number of wireless technologies available for users, one major difficulty is to interconnect different devices with different wireless technology together.

These services are highly heterogeneous and their number is growing fast. To facilitate IoT service search, some solutions rely on the use of Semantic Web technologies to create homogenous service descriptions to reason on and support accurate and flexible search. However, most existing approaches are centralized and fail to scale with respect to the number of advertised services. To address this scalability issue, we present in this paper a distributed, semantic-based IoT service search system. It relies on a hierarchical network of semantic gateways that represent geographical locations and host semantic service descriptions. To answer a service query, our approach is based on request matching and forwarding though the use of routing tables and similarity thresholds. Based on defined metrics, recursive clustering and information aggregation are performed over the hierarchy of gateways to construct the routing tables. We prove theoretically that our method ensures an accurate search of all matching services within the system. Experimental results show that our method enables to reduce greatly search cost with comparison to a centralized approach and has an acceptable search path length. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Centralized approaches; Geographical locations; Hierarchical network; Information aggregation; Internet of thing (IOT); Semantic service descriptions; Semantic Web technology; Similarity threshold; Internet; Query processing; Gateways (computer networks)","Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs route de Villejust, 91620 Nozay, France",,,,9780769550466,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

As the Network becomes huge scale, large scale multi-agent systems become more and more important. Multi-agent systems play important roles in various applications. However, large scale multi-agent systems encounter many big issues such as scalability and inter-operability. This chapter presents a different approach of large scale multiagent system architecture based on semantic P2P Network-Virtual Hierarchical Tree Grid Organizations (VIRGO) in mathematic terms. Other than unstructured and DHT-based structured P2P networks, VIRGO keeps the semantic meanings of the nodes according to their roles in the communities. In VIRGO approach, the agents are identified as domain names classified by the semantic meaning of roles in the organizations. The agents construct the VIRGO network by joining the virtual groups with the same names as their domains. We proof by mathematics that in this approach each agent has at least one path to communicate with any other agent and the performance is effective as maximin hops is less than log(N), where N is total number of agents. The performance bottle-neck of tree-like topology can be avoided by cache policies. Here, we also introduce a SQL-like language for inter-operation among agents.

The future of M2M communication in smart home lies in the aggregation and allocation of resources and service provisioning of diverse applications using different radio technologies. M2M communication may operate on the virtual sensor network to provide independent applications running on heterogeneous network simultaneously. M2M is going to play a major role in the area of Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living (SHAAL) providing assistance to the elderly people with smart sensors that monitor the home environment and provides aid health monitoring to human requiring medical assistance. The current state of the art frameworks are dedicated to specific applications with the support of single radio network with limited service provisioning options. However, in order to fully exploit the resources in this paper we present a service provisioning framework realization of M2M in virtual sensor network for SHAAL, which allows independent parties to work together in a secure and reliable manner. In addition to this, the framework is designed to include benefits of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) along with the use of different low power, low data rate protocols. A middleware is used as a platform to link the underlying virtual networks with various applications. The network virtualization approach is adopted to design an efficient middleware framework that can effectively discover and manage the underlying network resources and provide services at home gateway. The framework will be used as the basis for the development of the SHAAL networked system. © 2013 Penerbit UTM Press.

This paper discusses the motives to open up an intranet of things and make the things part of the global IoT, identifies the requirements from the involved parties, and extracts the essential architectural implications from these requirements. The proposed solution comprises the definition and control of Access Rights to the discovery and use of Virtual Objects (VO). This approach builds upon the widely accepted view that Virtual Objects serve as digital representation and gateway to Real World Objects (sensors, actuators, etc), and where VO databases serve to find these virtual counterparts. The Access Rights determine not only who may use a function of a Virtual Object and the conditions for that access, but also determine their discoverability when searching the database of virtual objects counterparts. Access Rights solve important requirements for security, privacy, and accountability, that are prerequisite to the expected economic and innovation benefits of an internet of things across organisational domains. Since verification of Access Rights to a VO plays a central role in the deployment of the IoT the scalable implementation with semantic technologies remains a challenge. © 2013 IEEE.","access rights; actuator; Internet of Things; sensor; virtual object","Access rights; Digital representations; Internet of Things (IOT); Real-world objects; Scalable implementation; Semantic technologies; Sensors and actuators; Virtual objects; Actuators; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Semantics; Sensors; Access control","Service Enabling and Management, TNO, Delft, Netherlands",,,,9781467358279,,,"English","IEEE Int.

There is also a growing trend toward integrating real world data into the Internet, which is provided by sensory devices, smart phones, GPS, and many other sources that capture and communicate real world data. The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real world objects (i.e., Things). This paper focuses on how to optimize the data exchange between the sensory devices and applications in IoT and Cyber-Physical systems. In particular, a method to construct higher-level abstractions of data at local gateways is proposed. This will reduce the traffic load imposed on the communication networks that provide the real world data. The proposed method is based on an information processing algorithm where gateways analyze the data collected from the sensors and create higher level abstractions.

Personalized health capability is limited to the available data from the patient. The data is usually dynamic and incomplete. Therefore, it presents a critical issue for mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents an interconnection framework for mobile Health (mHealth) based on the Internet of Things. It makes continuous and remote vital sign monitoring feasible and introduces technological innovations for empowering health monitors and patient devices with Internet capabilities. It also allows patient monitoring and supervision by remote centers, and personal platforms such as tablets. In terms of hardware it offers a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID. In terms of software, this interconnection framework presents a novel protocol, called YOAPY, for an efficient, secure, and scalable integration of the sensors deployed in the patient's personal environment. This paper presents the architecture and evaluates its capability to provide continuous monitoring, ubiquitous connectivity, extended device integration, reliability, and security and privacy support. The proposed interconnection framework and the proposed protocol for the sensors have been exhaustively evaluated in the framework of the AIRE project, which is focused on patients with breathing problem. This evaluates for the proposed protocol the data aggregation mechanism level, Round-Trip delay Time, impact of the distance, and the impact of the security.

In this paper, we propose a novel dual-radio architecture by adding a high-bandwidth radio on every sensor node. In WSNs, each sensor is equipped with two radio interfaces: the low-power IEEE 802.15.4 radio used on all sensors to transmit data within the network and the high-bandwidth 3G /LTE radio activated only on a subset of sensors, referred to as gateways, for sending data to the IoT. given the traffic demand for each sensor nodes, the number of gateways to deploy and the interference model, we propose a novel deployment method for placing optimal number of gateways in the WSNs where sensor nodes can join the IoT through the network's gateway, such that the lifetime and total throughput that can be supported is maximized while it also ensure a fairness among all sensor nodes. Due to the NPhardness of the problem, we then propose a novel heuristic by decomposing the problem into two sub-problems and solving them separately. From our extensive simulation conducted, using ns-2, we identified that our model improves network performance, including the network lifetime prolongation, throughput maximization, network scalability improvement, the average data delivery delay reduction and lead a high traffic load to meet the diverse application needs of WSNs. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","3G; Gateway; IEEE 802.15.4; Internet of things; Throughput optimization; Wireless sensor networks",,"LAVETE Laboratory, Hassan First University, Settat, Morocco",,,18286003,,,,"English","Int.

A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals. © 2013 IEEE.","6LoWPAN; IEEE802.15.4; U-Healthcare; WBAN; WSN","6LoWPAN; IEEE 802.15.4; u-Healthcare; WBAN; WSN; Electrocardiography; Health care; Internet; Interoperability; Standards; Transmission control protocol; Gateways (computer networks)","Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar",,,,9781467356169,,,"English","Proc.

Since data are the basis for enabling applications and services in W2T, it becomes imperative that enabling technologies for end-to-end security be developed to secure data communication between Internet user nodes and sensor server nodes to protect the exchange of data. However, traditional security protocols developed for the Internet rely mostly on symmetric authentication and key management based on public key algorithms, thus are deemed to be unsuitable for WSNs due to resource constraints in the sensor nodes. Specifically, acting as the server nodes in this scenario, sensor nodes cannot take on the heavy duty like regular servers in the Internet. Meanwhile, current security mechanisms developed for WSNs have mainly focused on the establishment of keys between neighboring nodes at the link layer and thus are not considered to be effective for end-to-end security in the W2T scenario. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end secure communication scheme for W2T in WSNs in which we follow an asymmetric approach for authentication and key management using signcryption and symmetric key encryption. In our proposed scheme, a great part of the work for authentication and access control is shifted to a gateway between a WSN and the Internet to reduce the burden and energy consumption in the sensor nodes. In addition, our scheme can ensure the privacy of user identities and key negotiation materials, and denial of service (DoS) attacks targeted at the sensor nodes can be effectively blocked at the gateway.

The constrained application protocol (CoAP) allows the deployment of RESTful Web services on limited devices by offering a protocol similar to HTTP that uses UDP as transport layer instead of TCP. This enables more efficient communication if non-reliable, asynchronous or group communication is required. Existing and mature home and building automation technologies like KNX, BACnet or ZigBee are based on non-IP communication and define a complete custom protocol stack. State of the art integration approaches usually offer a centralized Web service interface based on oBIX, OPC UA or BAC-net/WS based on SOAP or RESTful Web services. This paper presents the concept of a gateway that allows the integration of building automation systems into constrained RESTful environments by an IPv6 per-device interface based on oBIX using a novel constrained application protocol binding with efficient XML interchange message encoding. This integration approach provides a service-oriented architecture with uniform interfaces for control scenarios that span heterogeneous technologies. The evaluation results show the efficiency of novel protocol bindings compared to state of the art protocol bindings and message encodings. Performance evaluation results prove that even interactive user control scenarios can be based on these Web service interfaces.

To calculate the danger value of IoT with many dispersive sense nodes, the theoretical model of distributed danger assessment for IoT is explored in this paper. The principles and mechanisms of Artificial Immune System (AIS) are introduced into the proposed model. Data packets in IoT are captured in each gateway and converted into antigens in the simulated immune environment. Detectors use self-learning and self-adaptation mechanisms in AIS to evolve themselves to adapt the local IoT environment and detect security threats. The mechanism of antibody density is simulated to reflect the intensity of security threats which are happening. Through the detected security threats and their intensity, the values of IoT property and security threats' harm are combined to assess the quantitative value of danger for IoT.

These devices, often referred to as smart items or intelligent things can be home appliances, healthcare devices, vehicles, buildings, factories and almost anything networked and fitted with sensors, actuators, embedded computers. There has been sustained research work and standardization effort from different IoT perspectives like integration of sensor and RFID devices to the Internet. With the increasing trend of gathering business insights from unstructured data, the high volume of data generated by such devices is also of interest. Cloud based data mining platforms are suitable for analyses of such data and researchers have proposed architectures where personal mobile phones can act as Edge Gateway between the sensor network and cloud analytics platform. It seems that the surge in the volume of data generated by huge number of Smart Items can only be matched if a large percentage of mobile users start sharing the computation capability of their personal devices and work together towards true Participatory Computing in the IoT systems.

This architecture makes use of the distributed discovery services along with the EPC-BGP to provide detailed information about an object regardless of its location. In the EPCglobal network, each object is assigned an IPv6 address once it leaves the last gateway in the supply chain. The IP address of the last gateway enables backtracking of all the information about this object throughout the supply chain. To this end, EPC status updates are crucial in order to advertise any changes in the EPC into the supply chain. On the other hand, concurrent EPC updates, expired EPC databases and/or limitation of resources may cause blocking of an EPC update request. Therefore, we evaluate our proposed architecture in terms of blocking probability of the EPC update requests. To this end, We define three types of blocking, namely the Justified Update Blocking (JUB), Unjustified Update Acceptance (UUA), and Unjustified Update Blocking (UUB). We investigate the impact of the frequency of update advertisements on the blocking probability. Numerical results confirm the trade-off between blocking probability and communication/computation overhead due to EPC update messages. However, further investigation in terms of the number of advertisements and the distance between the routing tables confirms that advertisement of EPC update messages based on certain thresholds can overcome this trade-off. © 2013 IEEE.","BGP; discovery services; EPCglobal; Internet of Things; IPv6; RFID","Blocking probability; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Supply chains; BGP; discovery services; EPCglobal; Internet of Things (IOT); IPv6; Gateways (computer networks)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15503607,9781467331227,,,"English","IEEE Int Conf Commun",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891356156

In this paper, we describe an Identity Based Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (IBE-ECC) based on Tate pairing which is lightweight without any Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and no key exchanges. In addition, we propose a novel lightweight IBE-ECC scheme in which encryption is performed with no Tate pairing (computationally intensive) and is used only in decryption. This scheme is relevant for wireless nodes and in particular for Internet of Things (IoT) framework, wherein the wireless nodes do only message encryption, whereas the decryption is delegated to centralized servers or Gateways. We have also implemented our proposed scheme on a mobile phone with android platform for performance analysis. We observed that our proposed IBE-ECC scheme outperforms the existing IBE scheme in terms of complexity and efficiency of operation.

With the new developed IoT (Internet of Things) technology, remote authorized users are allowed to access reliable sensor nodes to obtain data and even are allowed to send commands to the nodes in the WSN. Because of the resource constrained nature of sensor nodes, it is important to design a secure, effective and lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme. The gateway node (GWN) plays a crucial role in the WSN as all data transmitted to the outside network must pass through it. We propose a temporal-credential-based mutual authentication scheme among the user, GWN and the sensor node. With the help of the password-based authentication, GWN can issue a temporal credential to each user and sensor node. For a user, his/her temporal credential can be securely protected and stored openly in a smart card. For a sensor node, its temporal credential is related to its identity and must privately stored in its storage medium. Furthermore, with the help of GWN, a lightweight key agreement scheme is proposed to embed into our protocol. The protocol only needs hash and XOR computations. The results of security and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides relatively more security features and high security level without increasing too much overhead of communication, computation and storage. It is realistic and well adapted for resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Gateway node; Key agreement; Mutual authentication; Temporal credential; Wireless sensor network","Authentication and key agreements; Authorized users; Gateway nodes; High security levels; Internet of Things (IOT); Key agreement; Key agreement scheme; Mutual authentication; Password-based authentication; Resource-constrained; Security and performance; Security features; Storage medium; Temporal credential; Authentication; Digital storage; Gateways (computer networks); Internet protocols; Network security; Smart cards; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor nodes","Xue, K.; Information Network Lab of EEIS Department, USTC, Hefei 230027, China; email: kpxue@ustc.edu.cn",,,10848045,,,,"English","J Network Comput Appl",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870693016

The heterogeneity of services being offered today on the enormous expanse of data as available from sensors and smart devices, needs a distributed infrastructure for analysis and computation. We consider a scenario where the computing infrastructure of an IoT framework is distributed and is capable of harnessing the computing power of mobile devices connected to the network in a heterogeneous grid. Edge devices like smart-phones, gateways, etc. can potentially contribute to the infrastructure. However, such devices and communication channels to such devices are intermittently unavailable, which may be due to network failure, planned shut-down, high workload on the devices, etc. In addition to this, we consider a task offloading context where the computing infrastructure inside the IoT invites bids from connected and available devices from the network to offload a part of the computation on part of the input data-set. We expect the overall completion time to improve in this setting. We investigate the data partitioning problem under the scenario where unavailability of communication and computation are advertised a priori and we pose the problem as a scheduling problem where cost of execution of an analysis job is to be minimized. We present a constraint-based model, evaluate the same on various scenarios and present some of the results. © 2013 ACM.","availability-aware; cloud computing; data partition; mobile grid","Cloud computing; Middleware; Mobile devices; availability-aware; Computing infrastructures; Constraint-based modeling; Data partition; Distributed infrastructure; Internet of Things (IOT); Knowledge extraction; Mobile grid; Distributed computer systems",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450325547,,,"English","Proc.

In most cases these networks were proprietary and stand-alone. More recently, many efforts have been undertaken to connect these networks to the Internet using standard protocols. Current solutions that integrate smart resource-constrained objects into the Internet are mostly gateway-based. In these solutions, security, firewalling, protocol translations and intelligence are implemented by gateways at the border of the Internet and the resource-constrained networks. In this paper, we introduce a complementary approach to facilitate the realization of what is called the Internet of Things. Our approach focuses on the objects, both resource-constrained and non-constrained, that need to cooperate by integrating them into a secured virtual network, named an Internet of Things Virtual Network or IoT-VN. Inside this IoT-VN full end-to-end communication can take place through the use of protocols that take the limitations of the most resource-constrained devices into account. We describe how this concept maps to several generic use cases and, as such, can constitute a valid alternative approach for supporting selected applications. A first implementation demonstrating the key concepts of this approach is described. It illustrates the feasibility of integrating resource-constrained devices into virtual networks, but also reveals open challenges. © 2012 IEEE.","Actuators; End-to-end communication; Internet of things; Network architecture; Resource-constrained devices; Sensors; Virtual network; Virtualization","End-to-End communication; Internet of Things (IOT); Resourceconstrained devices; Virtual networks; Virtualizations; Actuators; Communication; Internet; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Network protocols; Sensors; Virtual reality; Gateways (computer networks)","Ishaq, I.; Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University, iMinds, Ghent, Belgium; email: isam.ishaq@intec.ugent.be",,,,9780769548654,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

These Smart Objects are providing an enormous quantity of data. This work is focused on the personal and mobile health areas, where the integration of clinical devices in the patient's environment, this will enable new services with capabilities to predict health anomalies in real time, send alerts, reminders and offer an enriched feedback to the patient. This feedback will help and motivate to the patients with the treatments adherence and compliance and to follow a healthy lifestyle. In order to reach these services and feedback capabilities, it is required a full integration of the clinical devices and efficient processing of the collected data. The presented knowledge acquisition and management architecture is composed of, on the one hand, a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the integration of clinical devices, wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID.

Currently, technology is integrated in all objects of our daily life. TCP/IP let us monitor our home in real time and check ubiquitously if something is happening at home. Bearing in mind this idea, we have developed a low-cost system, which can be used in any type of electrical household appliance that takes information from the appliance and posts the information to the Twitter Social network. Several sensors placed in the household appliances gather the sensed data and send them wired or wirelessly, depending on the case, using small and cheap devices to a gateway located in the home. This gateway takes decisions, based on the received data, and sends notifications to Twitter. We have developed a software application that takes the values and decides when to issue an alarm to the registered users (Twitter friends of our smart home). The performance of our system has been measured taking into account the home network (using IEEE 802.3u and IEEE 802.11g) and the data publishing in Twitter. As a result, we have generated an original product and service for any electrical household appliance, regardless of the model and manufacturer, that helps home users improve their quality of life.

This development is confirmed by remarkable milestones such as the Semantic Web, Web services, social networks and mashups. In parallel with these developments on the Web, the Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., sensors and actuators, has matured and has become a major scientific and economic driver. Its potential impact cannot be overestimated-for example, in logistics, cities, electricity grids and in our daily life, in the form of sensor-laden mobile phones-and rivals that of the Web itself. While the Web provides ease of use of distributed resources and a sophisticated development and deployment infrastructure, the IoT excels in bringing real-time information from the physical world into the picture. Thus a combination of these players seems to be the natural next step in the development of even more sophisticated systems of systems. While only starting, there is already a significant amount of sensor-generated, or more generally dynamic information, available on the Web. However, this information is not easy to access and process, depends on specialised gateways and requires significant knowledge on the concrete deployments, for example, resource constraints and access protocols. To remedy these problems and draw on the advantages of both sides, we try to make dynamic, online sensor data of any form as easily accessible as resources and data on the Web, by applying well-established Web principles, access and processing methods, thus shielding users and developers from the underlying complexities. In this paper we describe our Linked Stream Middleware (LSM, http://lsm.deri.ie/), which makes it easy to integrate time-dependent data with other Linked Data sources, by enriching both sensor sources and sensor data streams with semantic descriptions, and enabling complex SPARQL-like queries across both dataset types through a novel query processing engine, along with means to mashup the data and process results. Most prominently, LSM provides (1) extensible means for real-time data collection and publishing using a cloud-based infrastructure, (2) a Web interface for data annotation and visualisation, and (3) a SPARQL endpoint for querying unified Linked Stream Data and Linked Data. We describe the system architecture behind LSM, provide details of how Linked Stream Data is generated, and demonstrate the benefits and efficiency of the platform by showcasing some experimental evaluations and the system's interface. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The data communication system is based on wireless personal area networks that support IP technology for connecting all nodes and network entities with a sink node which is the gateway to the remote management and monitoring service. The proposed system maintains lighting at a low level until vehicle or pedestrian motion is detected by a set of proximity sensors. In this case, the level of lighting is increased in order to provide better visibility while the area is occupied and dims to a lower level when the area is clear again. At the same time, data regarding lamp parameters like status and operation dimming level are transferred to the management system via a bidirectional channel that may receive feedback based on a certain system operation profile. The system can be easily installed over street lighting systems that use old and inefficient technologies without major cost thus, lowering energy consumption. The technologies used can make it part of a larger IP network following the concept of ""internet of things"" which may support smart road applications.

In order to realize the cooperation among different networks and services, it is generally adopted to deploy a centralized home server, usually the residential gateway, which is responsible for network administration and configuration, services delivery and so on. With the development of Internet of Things and Three Network Convergence Project in China, there're more types of data transmitting in home network, resulting in the increase of the load of centric server and time delay in traditional network, which will degrade the quality of household services because of the competition among different applications for the network resources, such as bandwidth. This paper proposes a novel Multi Application Domain Architecture (MADA) for home network, which divides the whole network into different subnets according to different household applications. Based on the Queuing Theory, the performance of multi-domain network is analyzed. With the help of OPNET, a simulation is also made to compare the performance in centric and multi-domain network through deploying different network scenarios. The simulation results prove that MADA can significantly decrease the load of the centric server and improve the quality of services in home network.","Digital home network; Multi-application domain architecture; Queuing theory; Three network convergence project","Data transmitting; Digital home; Domain architectures; Home networks; Home servers; Household applications; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-application; Multidomain networks; Network Administration; Network convergence; Network resource; Network scenario; Queuing theory; Residential gateways; Subnets; Computer simulation; Digital devices; Heterogeneous networks; Personal communication systems; Queueing theory; Network architecture","Ning, X.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian UniversityChina; email: xiningxd@gmail.com",,,20058039,,,,"English","Intl.

With progress of related technologies, the BEMS can gather more and more applications into itself. But the development also involves an issue which is huge data transferring and processing. This paper provides a multiple gateway system for wireless sensor network (WSN) management in BEMS, and also provides an efficient data transmission method for sensor data collection. The multiple gateway system includes at least a main gateway, several terminal gateway and more sensor nodes. These sensor nodes find a nearest terminal gateway and access to its LAN, and send data to it. The terminal gateway with a control module on it, can collect information of every neighbor gateway including gateway buffer size and distance to itself, and then optimize routing according to gateway information, and finally sends data to main gateway timely. The main gateway can process data like data fusion, and users can access these data via LAN or Internet. Using these multiple gateway system, the network power consumption and data delay can be both decreased, thereby promoting the system working efficiency. © 2012 IEEE.","BEMS; Wireless networks","Application scenario; BEMS; Buffer sizes; Building energy management systems; Control module; Data delays; Data transferring; Gateway system; Internet of Things (IOT); Network power; Process data; Sensor data collections; Working efficiency; Data fusion; Internet; Sensor nodes; Sensors; Wireless networks; Gateways (computer networks)","He, X.; Hitachi (China) Research and Development Corp., Beijing, China",,,,9781467317856,,,"English","Int.

However, in cable and satellite television networks, cellular networks, and some broadband Internet networks, the service provider often only allows use of set-top boxes, smart phones, and residential gateways obtained directly from the provider. The ability of a provider to implement such restrictions is limited by communications law. We review how communications law in the United States currently addresses the right of a user to connect devices of their choice. We propose a set of user and service provider rights that should guide development of new legal principles. We identify the pertinent network architectural principles, and propose concepts that can be used to create a new legal framework for device attachment to telephone networks, video networks, cellular networks, and the Internet. We illustrate how this legal framework, combined with standardized interfaces and protocols, can ensure an open network that supports innovation in devices. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Architectural principles; Broadband Internet; Cellular network; Internet of Things (IOT); Legal frameworks; Legal principles; Open network; Residential gateways; Satellite televisions; Service provider; Standardized interfaces; Telephone networks; Video networks; Internet; Internet protocols; Television networks; Cellular telephone systems","Jordan, S.; Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States",,,,9781467302685,,,"English","Proc.

The IoT scenario requires scalable connectivity to billions of embedded devices such as sensors, RFID's and machines. Current sensor networking solutions involve the use of gateways for hierarchical access to sensor devices, but this approach leads to specialized M2M systems which are not visible to the vast majority of Internet devices and applications. The MobilityFirst future Internet architecture provides a new framework for efficiently supporting sensor net and M2M scenarios through the use of an identity naming system for all network attached objects using the concept of a ""globally unique identifier (GUID)"". The use of GUID results in a ""flat"" network where sensors and other embedded devices are visible to all applications and devices on the Internet. In addition, GUID names make it possible to introduce context and content-aware services which are well suited for M2M scenarios where attributes such as location or type of content are more important than physical address for establishing network connectivity. This paper presents a discussion of how M2M service scenarios are supported in the MobilityFirst architecture, introducing the protocol layers and API's as they apply to sensors and embedded devices.

The novelty of the approach lies in the use of a mobile device as a gateway to reach the backend IoT platform, which supports application deployment and then applying it to the health-care vertical. The mobile device has hence been used as a pervasive healthcare gateway that collects data from the medical devices using either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and uploads the data to the back-end server in desired format. Hence the mobile application acts as the edge platform.

This study thus presents a prototype but fully functional system which, in theory, could be expanded worldwide, expediting development of the Internet of Things. Our earlier QoS-aware residential gateway (EmQRG) for real-time class-based queuing bandwidth management is reviewed and experimentally demonstrated in a novel embodiment which includes a FDIXP425-DevPlatform integrating the EmQRG with a wireless M2M ZigBee-based temperature/humidity monitoring network (FT-6250 + FT-6251's), which is treated experimentally as a fire alarm system. When any temperature/humidity module exceeds a preset value, the composite system activates a warning light bulb and sends warning messages to designated recipients. This emergency signal has top EmQRG transmission priority. Tests in the context of streaming video and simulated background internet traffic under light to heavy network congestion and bottlenecking show consistently good QoS for both the alarm and the streaming media. The emergency alerts are received immediately under all conditions. The warning light bulb turns off when temperature falls below the threshold value. Discussion shows that the EmQRG network can contain other embedded EmQRG networks and be embedded within higher EmQRG-based networks.

This new generation of networks are offering full connectivity with any object, through the Internet of Things (IoT) and/or the Web, i.e., the Web of Things. These connectivity capabilities are making it feasible to sense the behaviours of people at home and act accordingly. These sensing systems must be integrated within typical elements found at home such as furniture. for that reason, this work considers furniture as an interesting element for the transparent location of sensors. Furniture is a ubiquitous object, i.e., it can be found everywhere at home or the office, and it can integrate and hide the sensors of a network. This work addresses the lack of an exhaustive study of the effect of furniture on signal losses. In addition an easy-to-use tool for estimating the robustness of the communication channel among the sensor nodes and gateways is proposed. Specifically, the losses in a sensor network signal due to the materials found within the communication link are evaluated. Then, this work proposes a software tool that gathers the obtained results and is capable of evaluating the impact of a given set of materials on the communications. This tool also provides a mechanism to optimize the sensor network deployments during the definition of smart spaces. Specifically, it provides information such as: Maximum distances between sensor nodes, most suitable type of furniture to integrate sensors, or battery life of sensor nodes. This tool has been validated empirically in the lab, and it is currently being used by several enterprise partners of the Technological Centre of Furniture and Wood in the southeast of Spain. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ambient intelligence; Internet of things; Sensing furniture; Smart spaces; Wireless sensor networks",,"Bleda, A.

In particular, objects embedding Human Machine Interaction (HMI), such as mobile devices and, increasingly, connected vehicles, home appliances, urban interactive infrastructures, etc., may not only be conceived as sources of sensor information, but, through interaction with their users, they can also produce highly valuable context-aware human-generated observations. We believe that the great promise offered by combining and sharing all of the different sources of information available can be realized through the integration of HMI and Semantic Sensor Web technologies. This paper presents a technological framework that harmonizes two of the most influential HMI and Sensor Web initiatives: The W3C's Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces (MMI) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) with its semantic extension, respectively. Although the proposed framework is general enough to be applied in a variety of connected objects integrating HMI, a particular development is presented for a connected car scenario where drivers' observations about the traffic or their environment are shared across the Semantic Sensor Web. for implementation and evaluation purposes an on-board OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) architecture was built, integrating several available HMI, Sensor Web and Semantic Web technologies. A technical performance test and a conceptual validation of the scenario with potential users are reported, with results suggesting the approach is sound. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Connected cars; Connected objects; Human-generated observations; Human-Machine Interaction; Semantic Sensor Web; Sensor Web","article; human; Internet; system analysis; Humans; Internet; Systems Integration","Sigüenza, Á.; ETSI Telecomunicación, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Avenida Complutense 30, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; email: alvaro.siguenza@gaps.ssr.upm.es",,,14248220,,,22778643,"English","Sensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861879640

One of the latest developments is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that is intended to be used as the HTTP-replacement for smart objects that are connected to the Internet. Early adaptors in industry and academia already have developed a plethora of applications that build on this new standard and have contributed valuable insights and implementation experience. While most of the new applications interoperate in a reasonable manner, the integration of legacy is one of the biggest challenges. Many existing protocols for home automation have been designed with a narrow focus on very limited devices that communicate with each other in a local network. CoAP, in contrast, mimics the architectural style that represents the fundamental basis of the Web, and therefore follows a very different design approach. In this paper, we present a basic design concept to interconnect CoAP and the proprietary FS20 protocol for home automation. The key aspects of our approach are the mapping of FS20 device addresses to path segments of CoAP URIs and to map FS20 commands to the four basic CoAP operations for creation, retrieval, update and deletion of resources, and the dynamic discovery of new nodes to register their capabilities with the CoAP service. To prove the feasibility of this approach, we have developed a multi-protocol gateway for a popular low-budget integrated access device. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Application protocols; Architectural style; Design approaches; Design concept; Dynamic discovery; Home automation; Integrated access device; Internet of Things (IOT); Latest development; Limited devices; Local networks; Multiprotocols; New applications; Path segments; Proprietary protocols; Smart homes; Smart objects; Automation; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Intelligent buildings; Internet; Internet protocols; Standardization; Gateways (computer networks)","Bergmann, O.; Universität Bremen TZI, Bremen, Germany; email: bergmann@tzi.org",,,,9781467300094,,,"English","Int.

The IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) standard enables the use of IPv6 in networks of constrained devices. 6LowPAN enables the use of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) in WSN. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a web transfer protocol which provides several Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) functionalities, re-designed for constrained embedded devices. CoAP allows WSN applications to be built on top of Representational State Transfer (REST) architectures. This considerably eases the IoT application development and facilitates the integration of constrained devices with the Web. This work describes the prototype design and development of a Web platform which integrates a REST/CoAP WSN with a REST/HTTP Web application and allows a user to visualize WSN measurements in the Web browser. Since the WSN Web integration relies on a non-transparent gateway/server, we also show how to provide transparent cross-protocol resource access by means of an HTTP-CoAP proxy. The paper describes the major building blocks, functionalities and the implementation approach. © 2011 IEEE.","CoAP; HTTP; REST; Web applications","Application development; Application protocols; Building blockes; CoAP; Constrained devices; Embedded device; Hypertext transfer protocols; Implementation approach; Internet engineering task forces; Internet of things; Internet protocol technology; Low power wireless; Prototype designs; Representational state transfer; Resource access; REST; Seamless integration; Transfer protocol; WEB application; Web integration; Communication channels (information theory); HTTP; Hypertext systems; Information services; Integration; Mobile ad hoc networks; Network architecture; Personal communication systems; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Wireless sensor networks; World Wide Web; Internet protocols","Colitti, W.; Dept.

These objects can be very diverse in terms of the used network protocols and communication technologies, which leads to a wild growth of co-located networking technologies. Unfortunately, current consumer items are not designed to communicate with co-located devices that use different communication technologies. In addition, commercially available internet of things devices, such as sensor nodes, often use vendor-specific propriety network solutions. As a result, communication between these devices is only possible through the use of gateway nodes, resulting in inefficient use of the wireless medium. To remedy this situation, this paper discusses which features are required to integrate such a diverse number of heterogeneous objects into a single internet of things. In addition, the paper introduces the IDRA architecture, which is designed specifically to enable connectivity between heterogeneous resource-constrained objects. The IDRA architecture has the following advantages. (1) IDRA can connect co-located objects directly, without the need for complex translation gateways. (2) The architecture is clean slate, but supports backward compatibility with existing deployments. (3) Due to its low memory footprint, the architecture can be used in resource-constrained objects. Finally, the paper evaluates the performance of the IDRA architecture and discusses the feasibility of introducing IDRA in existing networks. © 2011, De Poorter et al; licensee Springer.","Clean slate; Heterogeneity; Internet of things; Network architecture","Complex networks; Gateways (computer networks); Information services; Internet; Internet of things; Network protocols; Reconfigurable hardware; Sensor nodes; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Slate; Backward compatibility; Clean slates; Communication technologies; Heterogeneity; Heterogeneous object; Heterogeneous resources; Network solutions; Networking technology; Network architecture","De Poorter, E.; Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University - IBBT, Gaston Crommenlaan 8, Bus 201, Belgium; email: eli.depoorter@intec.ugent.be",,"Springer International Publishing",16871472,,,,"English","Eurasip J.

We propose to use UPnP and end-to-end HTTP communication using CoAP to bridge WS&AN and IoT system. UPnP enables automatic discovery of sensor devices which directly connect to a WS&AN via a gateway. Instead of translating WS&AN and UPnP protocols at the gateway, we propose to use CoAP in WS&AN. This provides flexible communications between sensor devices and applications. Drawback of this end-to-end Web based IoT information system is vulnerability to excessive traffics from sensor devices or from the applications because there is no authority to monitor and control traffics in the architecture. We examined the performance of our implementations to find that the transmit performance of a single sensor device could be limited by the serial communications of embedded transceiver. Excessive data requests from applications might also result in the packet loss and wasteful WS&AN congestion. If the traffic is confined within the performance limits, the implemented UPnP and ZigBee bridging using CoAP shows satisfactory performance. We can subscribe up to 16 sensor devices data with 500 msec using simple HTTP POST requests. © 2011 ACM.","HTTP; UPnP; ZigBee","Automatic discovery; Embedded transceivers; Flexible communication; Internet of things; Monitor and control; Performance evaluation; Performance limits; Sensor device; Serial communications; Single sensor; UPnP; Web based; Wireless sensor and actuator networks; Zig-Bee; Computer network performance evaluation; HTTP; Internet; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Gateways (computer networks)","Mitsugi, J.; Auto-ID Laboratory Japan, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa 252-0882, Japan; email: mitsugi@sfc.wide.ad.jp",,,,9781450310437,,,"English","Proc.

ZigBee networks can not directly communicate with current Internet. It always needs a gateway to collect required data from a ZigBee network and to convert the ZigBee protocol to IP. Moreover, it scales poorly on routing and network management. On the contrary, Internet Protocol, especially the new Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), is a more promising alternative as scalability is concerned. If a wireless sensor network is developed based on the IP protocol, it does not need an application-layer translator which is mandatory for ZigBee networks. This can greatly save developing time and improve the efficiency for end-to-end communications. Many existing IP-based services can thus be re-used to monitor WSNs status in real time. From a perspective on network management service, this paper compares the advantages and disadvantages of ZigBee and IP. Since ZigBee is only appropriate for small-scale networks and suffers from the scope expansion of a sensor network, our suggestion is that future deployment of wireless sensor network devices should be IP-based, so that they can be easily managed remotely. To allow legacy ZigBee networks to coexist with IP networks, translators may be required during this migration phase. © 2011 IEEE.","Internet of Things; IPv6; Network Management; Smart Grid; Wireless Sensor Network; ZigBee","End-to-End communication; Internet of things; Internet protocol version 6; IP networks; IP protocol; IP-based services; IPv6; Network management service; Real time; Small-scale networks; Smart grid; Wireless sensor; ZigBee networks; Gateways (computer networks); Internet; Internet protocols; Network management; Smart power grids; Zigbee; Wireless sensor networks","Lu, C.-W.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan; email: s99321515@ncnu.edu.tw",,,21568065,9781457701672,,,"English","Proc.

We particularly focused on a ZigBee network as it can collect the latest information about 'Things'. The EPC Network provides certain static information about 'Things' such as name and manufacturer. To support end-to-end communication between sensor nodes and applications, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) instead of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over ZigBee is developed. A gateway on a local area network converts HTTP and CoAP. A pseudo Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol supports JOIN/LEAVE management of sensor nodes.

Nowadays, not only humans but also devices and the environments where we dwell are also able to provide their own information, through the usage of sensors. Through their interconnection over communication networks, sensors enable Ambient Intelligent scenarios achieving a true Internet of Things, and crossing the gap between computer systems and the real world. However, the different sensing devices and information generated by them, are of such disparate nature that it becomes increasingly difficult to access and make use of such heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a framework which not only considers a media independent information access to sensors and their supplied data, but is also flexible enough to configure and provide different means to best transport collected sensor information via wireless gateways, facilitating its deployment in different scenarios. We demonstrate its usefulness by providing a throughput efficient approach towards the collection and dissemination of sensing data, through sensing information compression and aggregation of multiple sources. © 2011 IEEE.","IoT; M2M; Media Independent; Sensors","Ambient intelligent; Digital world; Flexible sensor; Heterogeneous data; Information access; Internet of things; IoT; M2M; Media independent; Multiple source; Sensing data; Sensing devices; Sensing information; Sensor informations; Wireless gateways; Information retrieval; Sensors; Telecommunication networks; Information dissemination","Corujo, D.; Instituto de Telecomunicações, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal; email: dcorujo@av.it.pt",,,,9781457705137,,,"English","Int.

Recent efforts of porting IPv6 to sensor networks turn sensor nodes into equitable Internet peers and RESTful Web Services on sensor nodes allow a distribution of the application logic among sensor nodes and more powerful Internet nodes. The touching point between a sensor network and the Internet is the gateway which translates between the link-layer protocols used in the Internet (Ethernet, Wi-Fi) and sensor networks (IEEE 802.15.4). So far, the functionality of those gateways was fixed and simple. We propose to turn these gateways into smart gateways by enabling them to execute application code. As only the gateway has full knowledge of and control over both the sensor network and the Internet, smart gateways can act as performance-enhancing proxies and intelligent caches to preserve the limited resources of the sensor network. Also, the smart gateway can perform application-specific protocol conversion between highly optimized but non-standard protocols in the sensor network and standardized, but less efficient protocols in the Internet. In this paper we present the design of a middleware for smart gateways that allows the execution of application code on the gateway by offering simplified interfaces to the sensor network and the Internet. We also report preliminary performance results for key functions of the middleware. © Copyright 2010 ACM.","Future internet; Integration; Search; Wireless sensor networks","Integration; Internet protocols; Middleware; Proxy caches; Sensor nodes; Standards; Web services; Wi-Fi; Wireless sensor networks; Application specific protocols; Efficient protocols; Future internet; Non-standard protocol; Performance enhancing proxy; Preliminary performance results; RESTful Web services; Search; Gateways (computer networks)",,"Hughes D.Michiels S.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450304542,,,"English","MidSens - Proc.

The serviceoriented paradigm is the main concept to implement this approach and to cope with the heterogeneity of the underlying network. However, resource constraints imposed by the underlying hardware, such as 8-Bit micro controllers, require efficient protocols and often prohibit the use of technologies known from theWeb service domain, the major implementation of the service-oriented paradigm. Nevertheless, a quick and seamless information flow between embedded devices and Web services is an important requirement for many application scenarios, e.g., real-time aware production management or the Internet of Things.

This trend shows several aspects consistent in the evolution of computing including the increasing hardware miniaturization of the computing units and an increasing emphasis of the role of communication between the computing units - ""networking"". In addition from the software side there is an increasing need to software solutions that are robust, exhibit distributed control, collaborative interfaces resulting in adaptive capabilities also at the system level. Like the present Internet, wireless sensor networks are large-scale distributed systems, but composed of smart sensors and actuators. They will eventually infuse the physical world and provide ""grounding"" for the Internet thus creating the Internet of Things. Research on wireless sensor networks has been taking place at several levels, from the lowest physical level to the highest information level - the latter is much less developed than the research at the physical levels. In addition, much of the research in wireless sensor networks has been focusing on military or science applications. However, wireless sensor networks can also play an important role in the realization of ubiquitous computing for everyday life - creating what we call ""Urban sensing environment"". In urban sensing many natural gateways exist to collect and process the sensor information - static ones such as media devices, or mobile devices such as smart phones that can collect sensor information when entering the communication range of an active sensor. Some of the applications of wireless sensor network technology at home include, in addition to the surveillance functions, adding ""intelligence"" to utility consumption, electronic tagging, contamination control and disaster monitoring. Similarly at the community level ""traffic monitoring"" including people allows a development of totally unseen services from micro weather forecasts to new ways for ""sensing the environment"" for entertainment.
