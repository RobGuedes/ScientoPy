In this research effort, experiments are performed to discover vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth protocol and given the right technology determine exploitation. Using a Bluetooth keyboard, practical examples of the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol were able to be provided. Because of the results garnered, it is recommended that Bluetooth Low Energy not be used for any connections that may transmit sensitive data, or with devices that may have access to sensitive networks.

Firstly, an line-of-sight (LOS) Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model is established by RSSI value and actual distance between the Bluetooth-Low-Energy beacon and the terminal equipment. Secondly, based on the LOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model and the threshold-corrected RSSI peak, an NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model is established. Thirdly, the NLOS RSSI value is processed by the NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model to obtain the optimal ranging value. Finally, high precision positioning coordinates can be obtained by using NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy positioning algorithm and optimal Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging. In this paper, two experiments are carried out, and the experimental results show that: in the range of 7 m, the average ranging accuracy of the improved NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging method is 0.37 m, which is improved 49.19% when compared to the traditional method's results. The average positioning accuracy is 0.4 m using the positioning algorithm proposed in this paper. Therefore, in NLOS environment, the proposed ranging method and positioning algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging and positioning.

A miniature meandered planar Inverted-F antenna (MIFA) was designed, simulated, fabricated, and measured, achieving good matching with small profile. In addition, a single diode rectifier circuit was optimized at -20 dBm input power to convert the radio frequency (RF) energy captured by the antenna into DC power. Simulation results for the rectifier circuit show that it maintains a high RF-to-DC conversion efficiency. Using ideal components, an efficiency of 36% can be achieved at -20 dBm input power. When the non-idealities are considered in the rectifier, an efficiency of 20% at -20 dBm input power can be obtained.

J	Luo, BQ; Gao, JC; Sun, ZX				Luo, Bingqing; Gao, Jincheng; Sun, Zhixin			Energy Modeling of Neighbor Discovery in Bluetooth Low Energy Networks	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; neighbor discovery; energy consumption analysis; Internet of Things		Given that current Internet of Things (IoT) applications employ many different sensors to provide information, a large number of the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices will be developed for IoT systems. Developing low-power and low-cost BLE advertisers is one of most challenging tasks for supporting the neighbor discovery process (NDP) of such a large number of BLE devices. Since the parameter setting is essential to achieve the required performance for the NDP, an energy model of neighbor discovery in BLE networks can provide beneficial guidance when determining some significant parameter metrics, such as the advertising interval, scan interval, and scan window. In this paper, we propose a new analytical model to characterize the energy consumption using all possible parameter settings during the NDP in BLE networks. In this model, the energy consumption is derived based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) for an advertising event and a scanning event during the BLE NDP. In addition, a real testbed is set up to measure the energy consumption. The measurement and experimental results reveal the relationship between the average energy consumption and the key parameters. On the basis of this model, beneficial guidelines for BLE network configuration are presented to help choose the proper parameters to optimize the power consumption for a given IoT application.

It allows devices to receive information over a short distance. Thus, many researchers are actively investigating positioning methods that use beacons. However, the distance value of positioning in the existing methods is not always accurate. This article proposes a novel three-dimensional positioning system using Bluetooth low-energy-based beacons. While the conventional methods measure distances by obtaining two-dimensional coordinates (x, y) through the received signal strength indicator value, the proposed method improves the measurement accuracy by obtaining three-dimensional coordinate values (x, y, z). Finally, while comparing the performance of this new method with that of existing methods, the proposed three-dimensional positioning system reduces the positioning error rate by 27.3% compared to the existing two-dimensional triangulation method.

Furthermore, it is the foundation of a variety of services, such as indoor localization. We present a selective jammer against BLE beacons. The jammer selectively jams only BLE advertising beacons for which it was configured (API) on just the BLE advertising channels actually being used (narrowband). Such a jammer is hard to detect and hence requires a sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The prototypic implementation uses off-the-shelf embedded hardware which is low-cost, small-size and very power efficient. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution and reveal the impact of the distance between jammer and receiver on the advertising success rate. At short distances the jammer is able to successfully corrupt all BLE advertisement beacon frames making the BLE beacon source undiscoverable.

First in our algorithm, RSSI value is pre-processed: outliers of RSSI are removed, and moving average of RSSI is calculated. Then distance is determined using pre-processed RSSI and Kalman filtering. Finally, a triangulation algorithm is used to calculate the current location of the mobile device. Experiment results show that our algorithm achieves positioning accuracy of 0.2 similar to 0.5m.

Technically, it can be used for use cases which involve advertising to potential users at a particular location. In this paper, we propose to use the technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth 4.0) for proximity marketing at a retail store. Bluetooth Low Energy, a wireless PAN technology, is an eco-friendly form of Bluetooth specifically designed for IoT applications. With the advent of the practice of using the IoT framework for automating processes, an approach to use this technology at a retail store could potentially eradicate the need to hire marketing staff and invest in traditional marketing strategies. This process of automation makes use of devices called beacons for transmitting BLE signals, a mobile application on a smartphone and centralised data storage on a server. Beacons can be detected by a mobile application on a smartphone and beacon specific data regarding particular offers and products can be collected from the centralized storage hosted on a server, which can be used for marketing the retail store's products and offers. This application basically acts as a shopping guide for the customers of that particular retail store. In addition to the automation of the marketing task, machine learning can be used for personalizing offers based on each customer's purchase history. Some other features that can be incorporated into the product include an indoor positioning system, a click and collect facility, payment wallet integration, etc. This approach automates the entire shopping experience and is a novel application of IoT in automating trivial tasks.

Passive sensing techniques such as camera-based sensing can provide flow detection, people counting, and density estimation, but they fail to provide accurate identification of individuals mobility patterns. Active techniques such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags given to people require expensive RFID readers deployed to perform sensing. In this paper, we propose to use Bluetooth low energy (BLE) tagging as an alternative method. When low-cost BLE tags are set in advertisement mode, they can be detected by smartphones. In this paper, we design an architecture for sensing the crowds by requiring a large population carrying relatively cheap off-the-shelf BLE proximity tags, and considerably fewer participants to run scanning application on their smartphones to collect data. We performed a large experimental deployment with 600 tags and ten smartphones conducted during the five days of the world largest annual gathering (The Hajj). We were able to achieve 90% detectability rate while effectively reconstructing the routes of the participants.

Bluetooth Low Energy is one of the most recent advancements for IoT and particularly appropriate for ultra-low power sensors running on Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor coin cell batteries. Bluetooth Low Energy is effective option for indoor positioning frameworks which offers sensible exactness and minimal effort arrangement. An estimation strategy utilizing Bluetooth low energy labels turns out to be most enhancing and promising among different procedures for assessing area on the grounds that a most of advanced mobile phones uses Bluetooth. The BLE tags transmit advertisement packets intermittently, which incorporate one of universally unique identifier, a major and a minor value only identified with every tag. At the point when a cellphone gets the advertisement packet, the Smartphone Indoor Positioning Application initiates the scanning by turning on Bluetooth and detects a BLE tags. In this paper, received signal strength of BLE tags and transmitting power is measured first so as to take position of BLE tag for indoor situating. BLE CY8CKIT-042 is utilized as a BLE tag to arrange the BLE segment. The figured parameter such as RSSI and transmitting power is used to accesses the distance determination between smartphone and BLE tags.	[Kalbandhe, Ankush A.; Patil, Shailaja.

Recent security research notes a trend in which developers and vendors have opted out of implementing Bluetooth Low Energy link security in many devices, en-abling protocol attacks and attack frameworks. To help defend devices with no link se-curity, researchers recommend the use of Bluetooth Low Energy traffic sniffers to generate auditable communications logs. Unfortunately, current sniffers can only follow a single connection at a time, and some are ineffective at capturing long-lived connections due to synchronization problems. These limitations make current sniffers impractical for use in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents Bluetooth Low Energy Multi (BLE-Multi), a firmware enhancement to the open-source Ubertooth One that enables the sniffing of multiple simultaneous long-lived connections. To increase the capture effectiveness for long-lived connections, a novel synchronization mechanism is proposed that uses transmissions of empty packets to infer information about connection timing. Multi-connection sniffing is achieved by opportunis-tically switching between connections as they move from the active to inactive state, which is an inherent function in Bluetooth Low Energy to help conserve energy. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that BLE-Multi simultaneously captures multiple active connec-tions while outperforming Ubertooth One when it captures a single connection, paving the way for the development and implementation of automated defensive tools for Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless sensor networks.

As the healthcare cost is increasing and the population is aging, unobtrusive, low cost and accurate healthcare systems will potentially transform the future of healthcare. They are convenient to use, and can be utilized directly from home or community. These systems have various functionalities, such as bio-signal monitoring, signal analysis and biofeedback. They are consist of subsystems including sensors, data aggregators, data processing units, connected by wired or wireless communication modules. The developing goal of the systems includes to increase the performance accuracy, to make the system smaller, to prolong the battery life and to lower the product cost. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), comparing to traditional wired or other wireless communication modules, is beneficial for these design goals. Devices with bluetooth low energy are attracting more scientists and engineers in research and are changing individuals' lives with products such as wearable sport bends, smart toothbrushes, and intelligent watches.

Nowadays, the task of positioning and navigation in this kind of environment is becoming more relevant and useful. Commonly used GPS (Global Positioning System), which is typically used in obtaining location information, has no use in closed spaces. Thereby, we need new technology of real-time location system. In this research work we investigated usage of Bluetooth Low Energy RSSI to estimate location. We experimented with the following mathematical filtering functions to smooth rssi and improve accuracy: median, mode, single direction outlier removal, shifting and feedback filtering.

This paper describes the development and implementation of a proof-of-concept, a low cost and easily deployable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based localization system used to identify and locate patients. Using the received signal strength (RSS) of BLE signal and the uniqueness of BLE hardware addresses, patients can be identified and located within the hospital room. The value of RSS of BLE signal from wearable BLE beacon varies with distance to the wall anchored BLE scanner. The first part of the paper presents the results of the experiments conducted in a low noise and non-reflective environment. The second half of the paper talks about the proposed algorithm of localization of the subject within the experimental room.

Since BLE is well designed in favor of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) or Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs), fast network access has been considered an important issue for users. This paper studies the performance about BLE device discovery particularly with multiple devices. An analytical model is developed, based on classical ALOHA analysis, in consideration of three advertising channels of BLE. In addition, an enhanced mechanism is proposed enabling BLE scanner/initiator to learn the network contention and adjust parameters accordingly, so as to achieve lower latency. Through extensive simulations, the model has been validated highly accurate, and the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness in reducing unexpected long latency in crowd BLE networks.

In this paper we investigate the potential of BLE in a vehicular context. By means of experiments, we first evaluate the characteristics of the wireless channel, then we define a set of driving scenarios to analyze how BLE is affected by varying speed, distance and traffic conditions. We found that the maximum communication range between two devices can go beyond 100 meters and that a robust connection can be achieved up to a distance of 50 meters even for varying traffic and driving conditions. Next, we present a proof-of-concept mobile application for off-the-shelf smartphones that can be used to transmit data over multiple hops. Finally we discuss the advantages and limitations of BLE for Inter-Vehicular Communications (IVC) and propose potential applications.

BLE is used to transmit and receive data between nodes such as sensors, wearable devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. However, there is a possibility that an encryption key for communicating between nodes is cracked because of the security vulnerability of BLE. The security vulnerability of BLE is that the length of the Temporary Key (TK) to generate the encryption key is too short. It is a fatal problem in terms of a data security. We describe how an attacker can crack the encryption key through the vulnerability. To solve this problem, we propose an improved security method that increases the length of the TK. In the conventional BLE, the encryption key can be cracked within 20 seconds. But, it may take 600,000,000,000 years when the proposed method is used. Therefore, the proposed method can ensure that it is infeasible to crack the encryption key.

Several technologies have emerged over the last decade that allow cars to communicate with each other and with the Internet. In this paper we propose to use the new Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard as an alternative technology to exchange data between vehicles. By the means of experiments we show that smartphones with BLE radios can be used to send information at low latency from one car to another even while driving. A communication range of up to 100m can be achieved depending on the scenario and environment. Those promising first results are then used as basis for discussion to identify the potential of BLE for different types of vehicular applications.

A part of BLE is the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) which defines the data communication between two devices. During the initial connection between two BLE devices a discovery of services, characteristics and descriptors is required for the GATT to operate. During this discovery phase, the device is unusable as it builds the foundation for further data transactions. When unoptimized, this discovery step can take up to a few seconds, leading to frustrations for the end user or delays in some applications. In this paper, we aim to find guidelines on how to optimize this discovery process. A simulation framework was developed, able to simulate and analyze the packet exchange of the service discovery, while taking link layer parameters into account. The results show that minimizing the connection interval and maximizing the data length leads to the lowest discovery times. Practical experiments in real environment, however, show that the theoretically calculated times are not reachable due to processing overhead and retransmissions. Theoretical results also show that the current BLE discovery process, even after optimizations, has a lot of overhead. To fix the problems with the current protocol, this paper proposes a new Rapid Service Discovery Protocol, which enables a fast and efficient service discovery.

This paper describes the overall architecture of the node as well as the hardware and software modules design. A motion sensing system is designed for testing the performance of the motion sensor node. The system can capture 3-axis acceleration data and transmit data by low-power Bluetooth to a PC or a mobile client. The TI single-mode chip CC2540 is used as the communication core chip in this system. Moreover, TI MSP430F5340 and ST LIS3DH are used as the primary controller and the motion sensor. The system consists of a USB dongle communication node and three motion sensor nodes to achieve three motion sensor data while communicating with the USB dongle. The results show that the node is stable with a strong practical value. The system used in the field of physical exercise not only eliminates the physical limitations imposed by hardwired links, but also reduces the height of the system of long-term power consumption.

We start by introducing two orthogonally polarised antennas at the receiver, thus improving the probability of successful reception. This is followed by enabling error correction using redundancy introduced by the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code of BLE. The CRC error correction is based on a novel approach of applying iterative decoding algorithms. We then consider a BLE system deployed in a residential environment and utilise the presence of multiple receivers that are necessary to provide coverage. These three techniques come at no cost for the transmitter, thus preserving its energy efficiency. The final technique deals with error control coding in the application layer, in which some redundancy is added at the transmitter before data is sent to the physical layer. By combining all four methods, a distributed error correction algorithm is developed. Using real BLE packets collected in a typical 2-storey house, it is shown that the designed system can correct 80% of all corrupted packets.

The device uses single BLE System-on-Chip to process the algorithm of blood pressure measurement and data transmission. Through the newest Bluetooth Low Energy technology, device can send measured results to the smartphone. Therefore, users can get the information of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate on the smartphone. Besides, the format of data transmission packet is based on the standard Blood Pressure Profile specification from Bluetooth SIG. The homemade blood pressure monitor has high compatibility to communication with other devices using the same Bluetooth profile. The accuracy of pulse rate and blood pressures are verified through the CuffLink simulator. The accuracy of pulse rate is -1.13 +/- 0.52 beats, the accuracy of systolic blood pressure is 0.69 +/- 1.63 mmHg, and the accuracy of diastolic blood pressure is 0.20 +/- 1.02 mmHg. In clinical trials, the systolic blood pressure average difference between our method and auscultatory method is 2.66 +/- 2.71 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure average difference between our method and auscultatory method is 3.42 +/- 4.42 mmHg. As a result, this device has high accuracy for measuring blood pressure and pulse rate.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is often used for communication between devices, ranging from headphones to medical sensors. Our attacks target the BLE advertising mechanism to cause Denial of Service and Man-in-the-Middle conditions. BLE Peripheral Devices are discovered through an advertising process, in which the Peripheral broadcasts advertising packets to listening Central Devices. Such packets typically include the advertising address of the device, name of the device, and information about the connectability of the device. Peripheral Devices are generally assumed to have distinct advertising addresses. If a device advertises with the same address as another device, Central Devices need to decide which information is correct. We term the condition where advertisements contain contradictory information a "Disputed Advertisement". In the case where an advertisement contains optional information, there may be a condition where one of the packets contains maliciously included information, but is not contradicted by a legitimate packet. We call this condition an "Undisputed Advertisement", which is the basis for a novel attack that we call Bluestaking. The Bluestaking attack poisons advertising name cache on Central Devices with attacker-selected address-to-name mappings. Because BLE devices are not required to be named, an attacker can spoof a device and provide a name without any dispute from the victim device. This causes scanning Central Devices to cache the name indefinitely.

Decentralized adaptive indoor positioning protocol using Bluetooth Low Energy	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; Indoor positioning	LOCALIZATION; SYSTEM; LOCATION; PERFORMANCE; PHASE	Previous indoor positioning research has mainly been focused on using Wi-Fi and RFID. In recent years, researchers began to study using Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor positioning purposes. In general, positioning techniques based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), such as signal propagation and fingerprint, are commonly used in wireless/mobile networks. These techniques have certain limitations and tradeoff in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation and practical application/deployment. For example, both methods require a training process before deployment. In this paper, we present a decentralized BLE-based positioning protocol that does not require training before deployment. The training process can automatically be done on the fly by the anchor nodes. While the anchor nodes are broadcasting, they also scan for signals emitted by other anchors. This collaborative communication process exchanges location information and signal strength measurements between each anchor. This process builds a signal-to-distance reference list for the target node to estimate physical distance in a more accurate way. Experimentation in a real indoor environment shows that the proposed collaborative positioning method can achieve an error of 1.5 meters on average. This is generally applicable for most indoor positioning applications for locating people. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical, because it does not require training before positioning estimation and is adaptive to environmental changes.	[Ho, Yik Him; Chan, Henry C.

The wireless communication with the master computer allow slaves to be added, replaced or removed without the need for rewiring. Dependability can be increased as implementation of redundancy, both for masters and slaves, does not require wired connections between them. This concept has been utilized in an industrial prototype and evaluated in an experiment presented in this paper. The experiment evaluated the communication latency with Bluetooth Low Energy, compared to a wired alternative, which is important for reliable operation. The results showed a similar average latency, but the worst case was less favorable for Bluetooth Low Energy. However, since the slaves are intended to manage time critical operations locally, with the master computer in a supervisory role, these delays will be acceptable in many applications, when considering the advantages of a wireless master-slave communication.

However, the restriction of data communication topology to point-to-point, limited range of communications, and the lack of IP support make Bluetooth Low Energy less attractive for Internet of Things applications. In Dec. 2014, the Bluetooth SIG standardized the Internet Protocol Support Profile to support the exchanging of IPv6 packets between devices over Bluetooth Low Energy. Still, a mesh networking protocol for multi-hop support is needed for it to overcome the limitations due to short range and restricted topology. This paper introduces BLEmesh, a wireless mesh network protocol which utilizes the broadcasting capability of wireless transmissions. We identify the available data payload using Bluetooth Low Energy Generic Access Profile Non-connectable Advertisement Data for different number of nodes and packets to send in a batch. Then we compare BLEmesh with conventional routing method and flood routing method. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the number of transmissions by BLEmesh is significantly smaller compared to its competitors for some selected network configurations, reducing the aggregated energy consumption within the mesh network.

In this paper, we propose a new BLE-based fingerprinting localization scheme that improves localization accuracy. BLE is a narrow band communication that is highly affected by frequency selective fading and channel gains. We employ channel-specific features to location fingerprint to improve localization accuracy. Current BLE standards provide no API to retrieve an advertising channel number. We therefore developed a separate channel advertising scheme to measure RSS (Received Signal Strength) on each advertising channel. To demonstrate the feasibility of the separate channel fingerprinting, we conducted initial evaluations. Experimental evaluations showed that the separate channel fingerprinting improves accuracy by approximately 12 %.

However, it is difficult to build a test environment for testing with physical machines because of installation costs. This problem can be solved by emulation to reproduce BLE communication on computers; however, a BLE emulator is required. In this paper, we propose a BLE emulator called BluMoon for testing software systems using BLE. We impose the following requirements on the BLE emulator: (1) calculating the received signal strength for each frame and (2) imitating radio interference. To satisfy these requirements, we devised a software-implemented BLE controller with a host controller interface as a boundary and devised a data format called the BluMoon frame for sending and receiving data frame by frame. We designed and implemented BluMoon, and performed functional and performance evaluation as well as a comparative experiment with a physical environment. The results revealed that it is possible to implement a BLE emulator that meets the aforementioned requirements.

Therefore, we need the new technology of the real-time location system. In this research, the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RSSI was investigated. The mathematical filters median, mod, max, mean were tried to ensure the accuracy of RSSI. A different triangulation algorithm was used to calculate the positioning. In the study, all calculations and algorithms have been tried in real environments and the results have been recorded.

There are many different technologies that could be used in order to implement a reliable indoor location service, such as, among others, Beacon with Bluetooth Low Energy, Ultrasound wave system with special receivers. The choice between these technologies must take into account multiple parameters (e.g., user-centrality, proactivity,..), and should be driven by not only industrial relevance but also cost-effectiveness issues. In this paper we claim that Beacon with Bluetooth Low Energy is the best solution for indoor localization, and we present an extensive comparison between two frameworks that are the most relevant solutions interacting with beacon technology: Apple Core Location Framework and Estimote Monitoring. The comparison results offer a clear vision of which framework has to be used in order to implement a reliable and cost-effective indoor location-based service.

As a low-power wireless solution, BLE provides attractive energy performance that makes it particularly suitable for portable, battery-driven electronic devices. Although there are some prior arts focusing on BLE energy performance, it still lacks a thorough study on the important aspect of device discovery. Such energy cost, introduced by intermittent scanning or connection setup, could seriously affect the battery endurance ability of the devices. In this paper, we present quantitative analysis on the neighbor discovery energy for BLE. The modeling results that built upon measurement of CC2541 Mini-Development Kit have been validated quite accurate via extensive experiments. In addition, several interesting conclusions are found while investigating the achieved energy model, which may provide precious guidelines to the design of energy-efficient applications for BLE.

While many solutions exist, they often take a theoretical approach, reasoning about protocol behavior with an abstract model that makes simplifying assumptions about the environment. This approach creates a gap between protocol implementations and the models used during design and analysis. In this paper, we take a system approach to continuous neighbor discovery: starting with the concrete technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) we build a protocol, called BLEnd, tailored to its constraints. Moreover, we also consider the very real effects of packet collisions, to our knowledge a first in this domain. Our ultimate goal is to directly empower developers with the ability to determine the optimal protocol configuration for their applications; in this respect, the slotless operation of BLEnd offers richer alternatives than state-of-the-art protocols. Developers specify the minimum discovery probability, the target discovery latency, and the maximum expected node density; these are used by an optimizer tool to parameterize the BLEnd implementation towards maximum lifetime. This paper shows that BLEnd not only achieves the user-specified goals, but does so more efficiently than analogous configurations of competing protocols.

BLE devices featuring low-power are suitable for IoT applications. Meanwhile, the standard neighbor discovery protocol provides a wide range settings of parameters, which chould meet the variety of IoT applications. Whereas the different settings also have a great influence on neighbor discovery latency. This paper presents a theoretical model based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for analyzing the neighbor discovery latency in BLE networks, where the scanner and the advertiser are modeled in 3-distributed channels. The neighbor discovery latency in BLE is derived by applying the CRT to each specific channel. According to the simulations of the proposed model, we found some interesting results, which offers a better understanding of the relationship between parameters and latency performance. Meanwhile, the results provide a valuable clue to optimize the neighbor discovery latency.

As far as we know, we implemented the first prototype system to transmit IPv6 packets over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based on BlueZ, the official Bluetooth stack of Linux. To adapt IPv6 packets to BLE link, in addition to the implementation of segmentation and reassembly (SAR), header compression (HC) is effective to improve the transmission efficiency and achieve lower power consumption. The 6LoWPAN workgroup of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed several standards and drafts to specify the header compression scheme for IPv6 packet delivery in low power wireless networks. Based on the compression format defined in RFC6282, we proposed a new mechanism for the management of contexts, which can improve both power efficiency and time efficiency, extend the content of context information and provide better flexibility.

The proposed scheme includes the topology configuration procedure, topology recovery scheme, and on-demand routing protocol. The topology configuration procedure consists of node discovery, piconet configuration, and scatternet formation in a randomly distributed environment. The proposed on-demand routing protocol is designed to minimize the number of route request messages by forwarding them to a master and relay nodes in each cluster during the route request procedure. The performance evaluation shows that our proposed scheme substantially reduces energy consumption, which is the most critical issue on energy constrained networks.

DIORAMA disaster situation awareness and management system enhances the situation awareness of emergency responders by localizing victims in real time. In this paper we introduce a low cost localization algorithm for DIORAMA system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The BLE based localization algorithm improves the localization accuracy of stationary victims as well as re-localizes moving victims opportunistically. Our localization algorithm introduces a Kurtosis-based confidence metric which is used to improve the location estimation and a Maximum Likelihood (ML)-based detector used to detect victims' movements. Our experiments show that the proposed localization algorithm can detect the movement of the victims with a false positive rate as low as 1.2% and can localize victims within an average accuracy of 11ft.

BLE is designed for ultra low power consumption, ideal for applications requiring episodic or periodic transfer of small amounts of data, such as tags for identification and tracking of assets. These tags are physical devices associated with the assets being tracked, which should be as small and light as possible for the widest applicability. Distance to the tag is of paramount importance in identifying the nearest tag when several tags are present. The method of measuring distances is based on Radio Signal Strength (RSS), which we've determined is not accurate when using BLE. The paper presents the methods being used to enhance the accuracy of distance reading using BLE.

Inertial sensors widespread use within embedded systems also prompted the development of algorithms to cope with their inherent inaccuracy. These sensors, with small form factor and low cost, present an advantage for computing three-dimensional space object orientation. Also radio frequency communication devices are frequently associated with inertial sensors and embedded systems. Radio frequency communication protocols allow immediate data transfer and processing without cumbersome cabling. This work proposes a Bluetooth Low Energy based framework to evaluate the behavior of inertial sensors fusion algorithms. A Yaskawa Motoman NX100 robotic arm has been used to implement a set of predefined movements that granted the mandatory test accuracy and repeatability conditions. The Bluetooth Low Energy device has been implemented to transfer the inertial sensor data to a PC computer running a Windows operating system. The inertial sensors have been implemented with a MPU-9150 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a compass. The proposed framework has been used to test and verification of a number of sensor fusion algorithms.	[Amaro, J.

The aim of this paper is to investigate modeling techniques of co-channel interference affecting bluetooth low energy devices. The models are derived from recorded interference. Two types of models are introduced: a time domain model utilizing IQ data as reference and a spectrum-based model in which the reference signal is captured in frequency domain by a real-time spectrum analyzer. The recorded interference is also used as a reference to analyze the accuracy of proposed models. The proposed IQ-based model shows a degradation in performance for the environments with dominant bluetooth interfering signals. The frequency-based model not only addresses this problem, but also results in a huge data decimation in recording the interference.

Technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and RFID are commonly used to provide connectivity to people living in such spaces. However, these technologies can also be exploited to automatically detect empty/occupied indoor areas and who is occupying that area. Our work goes toward such direction proposing an occupancy detection strategy based on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack. We designed our solution by considering two fundamental challenges: costs and power-efficiency. We tested our system in several offices of our research institute by deploying few Bluetooth receivers and assigning to people a Bluetooth tag integrated with the institute's badge. We analyzed the performance of our solution with Bluetooth tags emitting at one single power first, and then we further refined our solution by considering the possibility of using beacons emitting simultaneously at different powers. The obtained results show a high accuracy without significantly affecting the energy consumption of the tags.

Simon; Harwin, William			Detailed Examination of a Packet Collision Model for Bluetooth Low Energy Advertising Mode	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; packet collision analysis; Bluetooth low energy advertising mode	RELIABILITY; DIVERSITY	The aim of this paper is to investigate the amount of energy that is required to successfully transmit information inside the Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) advertising packets. There are applications that require more than one BLE node to simultaneously transmit data. The BLE protocol utilizes a specific communication method termed the advertising mode to perform unidirectional broadcasts of data from the advertising devices. However, with an increased number of BLE devices advertising simultaneously, there will be inevitable packet collisions from the advertising devices. This results in a waste of energy, specifically in low-power applications where lower consumption is desirable to minimize the need for battery replacements. This paper examines a packet collision model for the BLE advertising mode with the results validated using experimental data. Our analysis shows that when the throughput of the BLE network starts to fall due to an increase in the number of packet collisions, the energy consumption of the BLE nodes increases exponentially with respect to the number of nodes.

Therefore, the test object or person is equipped with a BLE node and approximately central in each room a low-cost and low-power BLE sensor is placed. No stringent installation requirements or battery replacement is needed for these sensors. They send advertising packets to the mobile node, where the received data is processed quickly, based on the signal strength of the received messages, characterized by the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). No fingerprinting, propagation characteristics or trilateral statistics are needed to determine in which room the test object or person is located by use of the measured RSSI values. In this paper, the localization is done by a BLE development kit of Bluegiga. Measuring in a real-life environment, we can locate at room resolution a device during more than 90% of the time, without the need for a difficult installation procedure or battery replacements on a regular basis.

However, the complexity of the protocol and the lack of the simulation tools impedes the studies of BLE network performance. For this reason, in the paper we introduce the novel simulation tool, which is capable of simulating the communication in the networks of BLE devices. In the paper we discuss the capabilities and limitations of the suggested tool and compare the results of the simulations with the ones obtained with the real-life hardware BLE transceivers. Also, the paper highlights some of the results obtained with the developed tool, which disclose the effect of the communication parameters on the performance of the BLE protocol in the multi-node scenarios and point out few weak points of the BLE technology.

J	Faragher, R; Harle, R				Faragher, Ramsey; Harle, Robert			Location Fingerprinting With Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Indoor positioning; location fingerprinting; bluetooth positioning; bluetooth low energy positioning; iBeacons		The complexity of indoor radio propagation has resulted in location-awareness being derived from empirical fingerprinting techniques, where positioning is performed via a previously-constructed radio map, usually of WiFi signals. The recent introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio protocol provides new opportunities for indoor location. It supports portable battery-powered beacons that can be easily distributed at low cost, giving it distinct advantages over WiFi. However, its differing use of the radio band brings new challenges too. In this work, we provide a detailed study of BLE fingerprinting using 19 beacons distributed around a similar to 600 m(2) testbed to position a consumer device. We demonstrate the high susceptibility of BLE to fast fading, show how to mitigate this, and quantify the true power cost of continuous BLE scanning. We further investigate the choice of key parameters in a BLE positioning system, including beacon density, transmit power, and transmit frequency. We also provide quantitative comparison with WiFi fingerprinting. Our results show advantages to the use of BLE beacons for positioning. For one-shot (push-to-fix) positioning we achieve < 2.6 m error 95% of the time for a dense BLE network (1 beacon per 30 m(2)), compared to < 4.8 m for a reduced density (1 beacon per 100 m(2)) and < 8.5 m for an established WiFi network in the same area.

Numerous kinds of inventories are stored in a warehouse where locating goods can be troublesome for the employees. Specifically, in corrugated box company, inventories of paper rolls are placed in a huge warehouse where there are hundreds of paper rolls stock ranging from different weights and sizes. Finished goods are also stored in a warehouse awaiting delivery, placed in between hundreds of other customers' orders where delivery schedule varies from one another. Thus, the positioning of the goods is not permanent and is changing along with the incoming orders. The research aims to explore BLE beacons for the most effective solution in handling inventory placement problems. Common tracking technologies for inventories include barcodes, QR codes, and RFID. The fourth industrial revolution drives the application of IoT, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons are one of the examples in the area. It is the successor of the previous Bluetooth technology, which is more eminent in energy saving. In warehouses, BLE beacons are positioned to determine zone mapping in organizing the floor plan, assists in indoor navigation for guiding employees, and support asset tracking with beacon tags for identification and goods tracing.

The experiments described in this paper make use of commercially available low cost Bluetooth sensor systems. The presented method is based on field strength measurements of the received signals. Making use of the path loss model a reliable mapping procedure between measured RSSI values and distance has been established. Since RSSI measurements are subject to noise, reflections, multipath fading and other effects the obtained values can deviate considerably from the expected ones. In order to minimize these effects a sophisticated post processing of the RSSI values has been added to the localization procedure, which is performed in real time. Furthermore a novel calibration procedure is carried out during the initialization phase of the system which considerably improved the mapping accuracy between RSSI values and distance. Compared to established RSSI-based localization methods the localization accuracy could be significantly improved by applying the proposed methods. This is verified by measurements using an experimental setup. In contrast to many existing RSSI-based localization approaches, the proposed method can be considered as a remarkable improvement for low cost, low power and easy to apply indoor localization.

IoT involves smart devices that can be connected to the cloud in order to share and process all types of data collected through sensors. Moreover, 100% of smartphones and tablets shipped in 2018 include Bluetooth low energy, which will allow the interoperation with the upcoming 5G standard. As a result, different low-power hardware platforms have become available to either build prototypes, or implement full IoT solutions. One fundamental aspect while choosing a development platform is to analyze the power consumption of its components to build an optimal low-power application and extend the battery life. In this work, we present current consumption measurements of four Bluetooth low energy commercial platforms configured as central and as peripheral devices, these measurements are aimed to provide the data that are not available in the datasheets and which is needed to select, in an optimal way, the proper connection parameters for the protocol.

The Bluetooth specifications propose control of the anchor point (i.e., start time of each connection event) by changing the WinOffset parameter of the control protocol data unit (PDU), which can be very useful when the master schedules multiple connections simultaneously. Since we had no access to the controller (i.e., which wraps the physical layer and link layer of Bluetooth), we could not figure out how WinOffset works or use it the way we wanted. However, with Zephyr's advent, there is room to modify the controller of BLE, and we can adjust anchor points as we want using WinOffset. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first systematic study of this regime in the research community. We experimentally study how commercial devices actually schedule multiple connections and how this inefficient scheduling degrades BLE's performance. Based on the preliminary study, we propose BLEX that dynamically adjusts anchor points of multiple slaves to satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements without violating the Bluetooth specifications or intervening the BLE host (i.e., software-defined higher layer). Through extensive performance evaluation on off-the-shelf BLE chips, we show that BLEX provides stable performance regardless of the traffic requirements of applications and shows significantly reduced QoS failures compared to the state-of-the-art scheduling schemes for BLE.

As part of the Attribute (ATT) protocol, discoverable BLE devices expose a data structure called Generic Attribute (GATT) profile that describes supported features using concepts of services and characteristics. This profile can be accessed by any device in range and can expose users to privacy issues. In this paper, we discuss how the GATT profile can be used to create a fingerprint that can be exploited to circumvent anti-tracking features of the BLE standard (i.e. MAC address randomization). Leveraging a dataset of more than 13000 profiles, we analyze the potential of this fingerprint and show that it can be used to uniquely identify a number of devices. We also shed light on several issues where GATT profiles can be mined to infer sensitive information that can impact privacy of users. Finally, we suggest solutions to mitigate those issues.

For this purpose, both the hardware and the software aspects are considered. Thus, the BLE software stack from Texas Instruments and the CC2541 platform were chosen. Considering the CC2541 Keyfob device which contains an accelerometer, new facilities are firstly introduced by modifying the existing embedded software. Then, a new hardware component is connected, and the necessary software components are included in order to use this new element. The two main applications that are employed to monitor the activity of the BLE devices are analyzed and a new one based on MATLAB is introduced to improve the facilities of the existing applications. Thus, using the ideas presented in this paper, new BLE devices can be developed.

Noise pollution is any disturbing or unwanted noise that interferes or even harms humans. It has several sources such as public events and vehicular traffic. Being able to characterize areas based on acoustic noise level is useful not only for proving danger in terms of damage to the human ear but also for general discomfort from living near a constantly noisy environment. Internet of Things (IoT) devices can help to collect, process, and characterize acoustic noise, while they offer advantages such as small size and low cost. This work uses small-size Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to collect audio data in different parts of a city. The data are forwarded to a server station for further characterization and processing. Initial results show the promising performance of the proposed system, in terms of energy consumption and audio data characterization.

Although wireless recording can meet these requirements, conventional wireless systems are relatively heavy and bulky for use in small animals such as mice. This study developed a low-cost Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-based wireless neuronal recording system weighing <3.9 g and measuring 15 x 15 x 12 mm(3), with easy assembly, good versatility, and high signal quality for recordings. Both acute and chronic in vivo recordings of mice confirm the wireless recording capabilities of the system, with improvements in terms of the power spectral density (PSD) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with wired recording. Because of its low weight and compactness, the BLE-based wireless neuronal recording system can be used not only in mice but also in other animals, such as rats and monkeys, thus expanding the application of electrophysiological recordings in neuroscience.

It is included in most commercial consumer electronic devices manufactured in the last years, and billions of BLE-enabled devices are produced every year, mostly wearable or portable ones like smartphones, smartwatches, and smartbands. The success of BLE as a cornerstone in the Internet of Things (IoT) and consumer electronics is both an advantage, enabling short range, low cost, and low power consumption wireless communications, and a disadvantage, from a security and privacy standpoint. BLE exposes packets that enable a potential attacker to detect, enquire and fingerprint actual devices despite manufacturers' attempts to avoid detection and tracking. Medium Access Control (MAC) address randomization was introduced in the BLE standard to solve some of these issues. In this paper we discuss how to detect and fingerprint BLE devices, basing our analysis and data collection on interactions allowed by the standard. In our study, we propose the Bluetooth Low Energy Nodes Detect, Enquire, (and) Recognition (BLENDER) framework for enumerating and fingerprinting BLE devices for crowd monitoring and recognition purposes, based on four different strategies used to analyze BLE-enabled devices. We will show that it is possible to associate BLE randomized MAC addresses to actual devices. We will then describe a proof of concept for large-scale data collection. In addition, to determine the spots where the stations could be optimally positioned, we created a synthetic dataset based on mobility models and then we emulated the BLENDER approach. The latter allowed training Machine Learning models to predict the expected number of devices appearing at any particular position, day, and hour.

The existing indoor positioning systems based on BLE beacons employ the classical fingerprinting technique where user terminals collect signals from the beacons and do most of localization computations, requiring significant power consumption on user devices. However, constant power consumption on limited battery life of a mobile device can be problematic when it comes to supporting server-oriented tracking applications. In this paper, we propose and implement a new way of fingerprinting technique called inverse fingerprinting (Inv-FP), which is a server side BLE fingerprint system where most of the positioning computations are done by BLE sniffers and servers. We analyze various characteristics of Inv-FP in comparison with the classical beacon based fingerprinting system (FP), and demonstrate that Inv-FP can match the performance of FP but with minimal power consumption on user devices.

However, the original design of BLE focused on star topology networking, which limits network coverage range and precludes end-to-end path diversity. In contrast, other competing technologies overcome such constraints by supporting the mesh network topology. For these reasons, academia, industry, and standards development organizations have been designing solutions to enable BLE mesh networks. Nevertheless, the literature lacks a consolidated view on this emerging area. This paper comprehensively surveys state of the art BLE mesh networking. We first provide a taxonomy of BLE mesh network solutions. We then review the solutions, describing the variety of approaches that leverage existing BLE functionality to enable BLE mesh networks. We identify crucial aspects of BLE mesh network solutions and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we highlight currently open issues.

Especially, smart wristbands are booming in the market recently, which can be used to monitor health status, track fitness data, or even do medical tests, etc. For this reason, smart wristbands can obtain a lot of personal data. Hence, users and manufacturers should pay more attention to the security aspects of smart wristbands. However, we have found that some Bluetooth Low Energy based smart wristbands have very weak or even no security protection mechanism, therefore, they are vulnerable to replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, brute-force attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, etc. We have investigated four different popular smart wristbands and a smart watch. Among them, only the smart watch is protected by some security mechanisms while the other four smart wristbands are not protected. In our experiments, we have also figured out all the message formats of the controlling commands of these smart wristbands and developed an Android software application as a testing tool. Powered by the resolved command formats, this tool can directly control these wristbands, and any other wristbands of these four models, without using the official supporting applications.

Currently available pointing devices based on MEMS sensors (AIR mouse or AIR presenter) use proprietary wireless solution and their dimensions are copied from standard mouse. The new approach of our pointing device is based on standardized Bluetooth Low Energy protocol with minimal dimension and 3D way of control. This device can be used like a standard mouse in 2D with computer equipped by Bluetooth 4. The third measured dimension can be used to switch X or Y axis to Z plane, because we can control pointer without flat surface. The change of 2D pointing plane from XY to YZ or XZ can be switched intelligent by detection of acceleration activity in third axis. The device in full 3D mode will be used for control of rehabilitation arm in teaching mode by patient or therapist.

However, conventional multilink IoT sensor communication based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) enables only the processing of up to 19 peripheral nodes per central device. This study suggested an alternative to increasing the number of IoT sensor nodes while minimizing the addition of a central processor by expanding the number of peripheral nodes that can be processed per central device through a new group-switching algorithm based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Furthermore, this involves verifying the relevancy of application to the industry field. This device environment lowered the possibility of data errors and equipment troubles due to communication interference between central processors, which is a critical advantage when applying it to industry. The scalability and various benefits of a group-switching algorithm are expected to help accelerate various services via the application of BLE 5 wireless communication by innovatively improving the constraint of accessing up to 19 nodes per central device in the conventional multilink IoT sensor communication.

As a prominent wireless communication protocol in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, Bluetooth Low Energy always has compatibility challenges with wideband protocols working in the same frequency band such as Wi-Fi. In this paper, we present a lightweight strategy for Bluetooth Low Energy devices to cope with the compatibility issues with wideband interference. The strategy is based on the exponential backoff algorithm and is implemented mostly in the Bluetooth Low Energy application layer. The results of the experiments show that the strategy can deal with both static and dynamic wideband interference, reducing packet loss rates to around 3% and 5%, respectively.

It is included in most commercial consumer electronic devices manufactured in last years, and billions of BLE-enabled devices are produced every year, including wearable or portable ones like smartphones, smart-watches and smartbands. The success of BLE as a cornerstone in IoT and consumer electronics is both an advantage, giving wireless communication potential in the short range at low cost and consumption, and a disadvantage, from a security and privacy standpoint. BLE exposes packets that enable a potential attacker to detect, enquire and fingerprint actual devices despite manufacturers attempts to avoid detection and tracking. MAC address randomization was introduced in the BLE standard to solve some of these issues. In this paper we discuss how to detect and fingerprint BLE devices, basing our analysis and data collection on GAP (Generic Access Profile) and GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) protocols and data that can be recovered from devices by interactions allowed by the standard. In our study we focus on the possibility of enumerating and creating fingerprints of discovered devices, for crowd monitoring and recognition purposes, associating BLE randomized MAC addresses to actual devices using computed fingerprints when GATT is exploitable. We describe how large scale data collection can be obtained using automatic scanning devices with long range communication hardware, to uplink collected data in cloud-based applications and to a data store.

This field is a constantly evolving environment, for which new protocols are constantly appearing. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the technologies, the most appropriate candidate must be selected in order to get the best performance to satisfy the application requirements. One of these protocols is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), particularly with the upgrades introduced in version 5.x. Its new features are focused on providing increased range, improving robustness, and expanding beaconing capabilities. Connectionless applications such as information broadcasting in Smart Cities could take advantage of this protocol. Furthermore, the wide availability on common devices (mobile phones, car infotainment, etc.), the deployment of these applications can be carried out easily and at low cost. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the new robust, long-range radio mode of BLE over a set of Smart Cities scenarios, taking into account different conditions such as wireless interference, distances, dynamicity, etc. The results show a promising performance of the protocol even with these constraints.

Great emphasis was placed on minimizing hardware area and power consumption. Most of the complex and sequential functions were moved to the software Intermediate Layer introduced in this paper. Furthermore, Single Port RAM (SPRAM) was used to reduce the number of registers in the design. Flexibility was achieved by division of the hardware into two separate clock domains. Hardware part was designed using fully synthesizable Verilog HDL to simplify integration process into a System on Chip (SoC).

We assume a scenario with an energy-constrained transmitter and a constraint-free infrastructure, which allows us to introduce additional signal processing at the receiving side while keeping the transmitter intact. A novel approach of applying iterative decoding techniques to the BLE CRC code is investigated in this work. By using these techniques and real BLE packets collected in an office environment, we show that by enabling CRC error correction, the sensitivity of the BLE receiver can be improved by up to 3 dB. At the same time, up to 60% of corrupted packets can be corrected, which directly translates to a significant reduction in the number of retransmissions and a noticeable energy saving.

However, the throughput of a BLE system would be much lower since we need to account for various protocol overheads, adaptive RF connection adjustments for maintaining robust links amid interference, and protocol limitations based on BLE data exchange strategy and operations such as connection intervals, packet size and packet acknowledgment scheme. In this paper, we practically investigate the maximum throughput achievable in a simple BLE 4.2 network of two nodes, used in a data logging application. In this type of application, one node always has data to transmit and the other node which collects the transmitted sensor data does not have any data to send. We will also consider the effect of BLE parameters in this study. The result of our study shows that the maximum amount of throughput is 221.7 kbps for this application under the condition that the wireless link is error free and application always has data to transmit.

In this monitoring system, a BLE signal scanner scans signal strength of BLE tags carried by people, to thus infer human movement patterns within its monitoring zone. However to the extent of our knowledge one main aspect of this monitoring system which has not yet been thoroughly investigated in literature is how to build a sound theoretical model, based on tunable BLE communication parameters such as scanning time interval and advertising time interval, to enable the study and design of effective and efficient movement monitoring systems. In this paper, we proposed and developed a statistical model based on Monte-Carlo simulation, which can be utilized to assess impacts of BLE technology parameters in terms of latency and efficiency, on a movement monitoring system, and can thus benefit a more efficient system design.

J	Spork, M; Boano, CA; Romer, K				Spoerk, Michael; Boano, Carlo Alberto; Roemer, Kay			Improving the Timeliness of Bluetooth Low Energy in Dynamic RF Environments	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET OF THINGS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; BLE; dependability; interference		The ability to communicate within given delay bounds in noisy RF environments is crucial for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) applications used in safety-critical application domains, such as health care and smart cities. In this work, we experimentally study the latency of BLE communications in the presence of radio interference and show that applications may incur long and unpredictable transmission delays. To mitigate this problem, we devise a model capturing the timeliness of connection-based BLE communications in noisy RF channels by expressing the impact of radio interference in terms of the number of connection events necessary to complete a successful data transmission (nCE). We show that this quantity can be estimated using the timing information of commands sent over the host controller interface of common BLE devices, hence without additional communication overhead or energy expenditure. We further show that a BLE device can make use of our BLE timeliness model and recent nCE measurements to adapt its BLE communication parameters at runtime, thereby improving its performance in the presence of dynamic radio interference. We implement such an adaptive scheme on the popular nRF52840 platform and perform an extensive experimental study in multiple indoor environments using three different BLE platforms. Our results show that a BLE application can, indeed, make use of the proposed model and recent nCE measurements to adapt its connection interval at runtime to increase the timeliness of its communications, reducing the number of delayed packets in noisy RF environments by up to a factor of 40.

Since fading, shadowing and antenna patterns cause severe RSSI fluctuations, many RSSI-based localization systems use fingerprinting instead of parameter estimation based on a channel model (e.g. trilateration from distance estimates). Fingerprinting however requires a large effort for training data acquisition and frequent updates in dynamic environments. In this paper we focus on wireless access control with BLE. We demonstrate that a practical implementation of such a tracking system can meet the typical demands of generic access control problems with low-complexity parameter estimation techniques, namely trilateration and optional Kalman filtering. Thereby, satisfactory accuracy is enabled by diversity (averaging in space, time and frequency), calibration and appropriate observation space modeling. We find that including the RSSI directly in the observation space renders trilateration obsolete, which reduces complexity even further.

In this paper, we propose a received signal strength indication (RSSI) based Bluetooth positioning method. There are two phases in the procedure of our positioning: offline training and online locating. In the phase of offline training, we use piecewise fitting based on the lognormal distribution model to train the propagation model of RSSI for every BLE reference nodes, respectively, in order to reduce the influence of the positioning accuracy because of different locations of BLE reference nodes. Here we design a Gaussian filter to pre-process the receiving signals in different sampling points. In the phase of online locating, we use weighted sliding window to reduce fluctuations of the real-time signals. In addition, we propose a distance weighted filter based on triangle trilateral relations theorem, which can reduce the influence of positioning accuracy due to abnormal RSSI and improve the location accuracy effectively. Besides, in order to reduce the errors of targets coordinates caused by ordinary least squares method, we propose a collaborative localization algorithm based on Taylor series expansion. Another important feature of our method is the active learning ability of BLE reference nodes. Every reference node adjusts its pre-trained model according to the received signals from detecting nodes actively and periodically, which improve the accuracy of positioning greatly. Experiments show that the probability of locating error less than 1.5 meter is higher than 80% using our positioning method.

With BLE, the small packets of data can be exchanged over a wireless channel, whereas the data security is a concern. For example, the BLE standards define that if one BLE device with input-output capabilities tries to establish a connection while the other BLE device does not support input-output, an unauthenticated channel will be established. That is, in the worst case, the connection is established where no security is applied. To mitigate this issue, we propose a security protocol, named BALSAPro, at the application layer that complements the existing protocols such as Security Manager Protocol (SMP), which can help establish a secure channel with authentication and non-repudiation, when pairing has not been used. In the evaluation, we implement and evaluate our protocol performance compared with similar work at the application layer. The results demonstrate that our protocol can enhance the security level with less time consumption.

We have tested the effect of connection interval on the throughput and compared power efficiency relating to throughput for various BLE versions and different transactions. The presented results reveal that shorter connection intervals increase throughput for read/write transactions, but that is not the case for the notify and read/write without response transactions.

Several technologies, such as WiFi, RFID, radio beacons, are candidates for indoor localization solutions. Usually, they are used together for a better coverage and for a better user experience. However, the main technology for indoor localization is represented by Bluetooth Low Energy radio beacons. It provides a better localization accuracy and a low energy consumption. In this paper, a radio beacon indoor localization solution, based on signal map determined in advance, is evaluated. The paper presents the results regarding the localization accuracy obtained in several scenarios, such as, variation of beacons' transmission power, number of samples per measurement point, and number of beacons.

More specifically, to deal with the fact that RSSI-based solutions are prone to drastic fluctuations, GMMs are trained to more accurately represent the underlying distribution of the RSSI values. For assigning real-time observed RSSI vectors to different zones, first a Kalman Filter is applied to smooth the RSSI vector and form its Gaussian model, which is then compared in distribution with learned GMMs based on Bhattacharyya distance (BD) and via a weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) approach.

This fact can be leveraged to carry out opportunistic sensor data collection (OSDC) in scenarios where a sensor node cannot communicate with infrastructure nodes. In such cases, a mobile entity (e.g., a pedestrian or a vehicle) equipped with a BLE-enabled device can collect the data obtained by the sensor node when both are within direct communication range. In this paper, we characterize, both analytically and experimentally, the performance and trade-offs of BLE as a technology for OSDC, for the two main identified approaches, and considering the impact of its most crucial configuration parameters. Results show that a BLE sensor node running on a coin cell battery can achieve a lifetime beyond one year while transferring around 10 Mbit/day, in realistic OSDC scenarios.

Wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) may provide inexpensive solutions. In this paper, we propose obstruction-aware signal-loss-tolerant indoor positioning (OASLTIP), a cost-effective BLE-based indoor positioning algorithm. OASLTIP uses a combination of techniques together to provide optimum tracking performance by taking into account the obstructions in the environment, and also, it can handle a loss of signal. We use running average filtering to smooth the received signal data, multilateration to find the measured position of the tag, and particle filtering to track the tag for better performance. We also propose an optional receiver placement method and provide the option to use fingerprinting together with OASLTIP. Moreover, we give insights about BLE signal strengths in different conditions to help with understanding the effects of some environmental conditions on BLE signals. We performed extensive experiments for evaluation of the OASLTool we developed. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of the system both in a simulated environment and in real-world conditions. In a highly crowded and occluded office environment, our system achieved 2.29 m average error, with three receivers. When simulated in OASLTool, the same setup yielded an error of 2.58 m.

As a result, several attacks have targeted this protocol or its implementations in recent years, illustrating the growing interest for this technology. However, some major challenges remain from an offensive perspective, such as injecting arbitrary frames, hijacking the Slave role or performing a Manin-The-Middle in an already established connection. In this paper, we describe a novel attack called InjectaBLE, allowing to inject malicious traffic into an existing connection. This attack is highly critical as the vulnerability exploited is inherent to the BLE specification itself, which means that any BLE connection can be possibly vulnerable, regardless of the BLE devices involved in the connection. We describe the theoretical foundations of the attack, how to implement it in practice, and we explore four critical attack scenarios allowing to maliciously trigger a specific feature of the target device, hijack the Slave and Master role or to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. Finally, we discuss the impact of this attack and outline some mitigation measures.

Specifically, in a positioning system using bluetooth low energy, the positioning performance of two types of positioning algorithms is performed using a plurality of smartphones. As a result, we confirmed that the fingerprint algorithm does not always provide sufficient positioning performance. It depends on the model of the smartphone used. On the other hand, the hybrid algorithm that the authors have already proposed is robust in the difference of the received signal characteristics of the smartphone. Consequently, we spotlighted that the use of multiple devices is essential for providing high-quality location-based services in real environments in the performance evaluation of radio wave-based positioning systems using smartphones.

Our system comprises a mounting device located close to the BLE sensor and a part located on the water surface. In the water, the mounting device receives the BLE signals from the sensor and converts them into acoustic waves that are emitted from a speaker.

In the water, the mounting device receives the BLE signals from the sensor and converts them into acoustic waves that are emitted from a speaker. The part on the water surface receives those acoustic waves via a microphone and demodulates the data transmitted by the BLE sensor.

The performance evaluation of classical Bluetooth device discovery have been intensively studied using analytical modeling and simulative methods, but these techniques are not applicable to BLE, since BLE has a fundamental change in the design of the discovery mechanism, including the usage of three advertising channels. Recently, there several works have analyzed the topic of BLE device discovery, but these studies are still far from thorough. It is thus necessary to develop a new, accurate model for the BLE discovery process. In particular, the wide range settings of the parameters introduce lots of potential for BLE devices to customize their discovery performance. This motivates our study of modeling the BLE discovery process and performing intensive simulation. This paper is focused on building an analytical model to investigate the discovery probability, as well as the expected discovery latency, which are then validated via extensive experiments. Our analysis considers both continuous and discontinuous scanning modes. We analyze the sensitivity of these performance metrics to parameter settings to quantitatively examine to what extent parameters influence the performance metric of the discovery processes.

It has transformed the classic Bluetooth into a technology that can be embedded into resource constrained devices running on a cell coin battery for months or years. Most BLE devices that are sold in the market use the Just Works pairing mode to establish a connection with peer devices. This mode is so lightweight that it leaves the implementation of security to application developers and device manufacturers. Unfortunately, as the market does not want to pay for security, a number of vulnerable smart devices are strolling around in the market. In this paper, we discuss how Bluetooth devices that use the Just Works pairing mode can be exploited to become nonoperational. We conduct a case study on three different Bluetooth smart devices. We show how these devices can be attacked and abused to not work properly. We also present a vulnerability that is due to the behavior of BLE smart devices and the Just Works pairing mode. This vulnerability can be exploited to generate an attack that affects BLE availability. We propose a solution to mitigate the attack.

But, the BLE still has many challenging issues which must be resolved before deploying it for the technologies. In this paper, an enhanced discovery mechanism is proposed for BLE devices to avoid collisions during advertisement process, so as to achieve lower latency as well as energy consumption. The proposed scheme is modeled and validated via analytical and simulation methods. The proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness in avoiding unexpected long latency and much energy consumption by carrier sensing during discovery process in crowded BLE networks.

However, specific applications have various requirements and do not always need all features offered by standard protocols, making them inefficient. This paper focuses on standard Bluetooth Low Energy modifications, reducing control overhead for the intended healthcare application. Specifically, the connection establishment, device pairing, and connection parameter negotiations have been targeted. The simulation-based experiments showed over 20 times reduction of control-overhead time preceding a data transmission. It does not just directly increase the energy efficiency of communication; it also prolongs the time for sensor-based end devices to spend in an energy-saving mode. The result is a longer runtime of such sensor devices powered by batteries.

BLE has become a recent topic of research in both the Internet and the wireless industry. This paper introduces BLEmesh, a wireless mesh network protocol which utilizes the broadcasting capability of wireless transmissions. The available data payload using BLE's Generic Access Profile (GAP) is used for data transfer. The data from different number of nodes and packets are send in batches. The nRF51822 device is used to implement the mesh network with the use of the soft device application provided by the developers to configure the node to switch between a peripheral and central node for data transfer. Three different sensors, namely heart beat sensor, temperature sensor, and touch sensor, are interfaced with the nRF51822 to show the mesh network working, and also the values are tabulated. The results indicate that the latency and power consumption of the proposed BLEmesh network is less than previous implementations.

This paper contributes to cover this gap by: (i) presenting a new indoor BLE dataset; (ii) reviewing several, meaningful use cases in different application scenarios; and (iii) discussing alternative uses of the dataset in the evaluation of different positioning and navigation applications, namely localization, tracking, occupancy and social interaction.

J	Lizbetin, J; Pecman, J				Lizbetin, Jan; Pecman, Jan			Possibilities of Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon Technology to Locate Objects Internally: A Case Study	TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; beacon; indoor localization; automatic identification		The developments that are occurring in relation to Industry 4.0 are making it possible to automate a huge number of production activities. Automation includes the possibility of automatically identifying individual elements of a system. One of the options for doing this involves the use of Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The system's advantages lie in its wide availability, economic simplicity, ability to design individual system elements, and overall system architecture. The system applied in the case study presented in this article consisted of beacons from Accent Systems and identification gateways based on the Raspberry Pi Zero W device. During several hours of testing, the functionality and reliability of all system components was demonstrated. The measurements showed that the system was able to determine the distance from a gate in line of sight with 94% accuracy. With regards to indirect visibility, when a metal crate was used to shield the beacon from the gateway, the system was able to determine the exact distance only 22% of the time. However, the variance between the actual and measured values was found to be small, therefore proving sufficient for most use cases. The major advantage of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons, and Bluetooth technology in general, is its massive ubiquity in the market. Since the Bluetooth module is part of every smartphone, this system can be made available to a wide range of users.

Despite the competition from ANT+, ZigBee, Nike+, NFC and RF4CE, in 2010 the Bluetooth SIG (special interest groups) adopted a new wireless technology named Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE coexist with Bluetooth in the same chip (called dual mode) therefore assuring this technology a rapid growth among smartphones, iOS, tablets, laptops and PCs. In fact, Bluetooth SIG also announced that it shall be hard to find a smartphone or tablet-PC that does not integrate BLE in the near future. Despite this accelerated growth, BLE shares the same band with Wi-Fi and all other low power technologies, so in order to achieve QoS, a mandatory requirement in many systems, tests for interference and coexistence must be performed. This study analysis the impact of a BLE sensor network on a crowded 2.4GHz room, with multiple Wi-Fi routers, ZigBee sensors and Bluetooth technology. We also compare the results with the ones obtained inside an anechoic chamber on similar experiences.

Hence, performance improvement during the discovery process has become one of major concerns. In BLE networks, advertisement interval of advertiser directly influences the performance, such as discovery latency and energy consumption. Frequent transmissions of advertising packet may result in collisions and serious energy consumption. On the contrary, larger advertisement interval may lead to delayed device discovery. In this paper we propose an algorithm to dynamically adjust its advertisement interval considering the network conditions based on a carrier sensing (CS) scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has outstanding performance compared with basic CS scheme and BLE standard in crowded BLE networks.

Recent researches show that Wi-Fi module in smartphones could be used to improve the traffic safety by broadcasting pedestrian position data. However, these Wi-Fi-based schemes could not achieve two-way communication with low latency, which would seriously affect the user experience. To address this issue, we propose an Android application called BLE-Horn, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to realize the bidirectional many-to-many communications. What's more, BLE also has advantages like lower battery consumption, low latency, low cost and it is also widely supported by smartphones. We redefine a Compressed GPS Information Packet (CGIP) in Bluetooth advertising packets and use a collision warning algorithm to detect the potential collision. In the real road test, we show that BLE-Horn can support at least 5 devices to communicate simultaneously between each other. The measured communication latency is as low as 56ms. With BLE-Horn running for an hour in the background, the battery level drops off only by 8.2 percents.

Experimentation demonstrates that the RSSI value of BLE signals is unstable in indoor environments. The principle underlying this behavior is discussed in this paper. Two self-adaptive filters (smoothing filter and wavelet filter) are applied to stabilize and de-noise the RSSI sequence. We demonstrate that the stability of localization performance is enhanced by employing these filters. The standard deviation of the RSSI sequence is reduced from 4.6 meters to 0.8 meters, which means that a steady increase in the accuracy and stabilization of the localization is achieved.

For IoTH, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) - a subset of the recent Bluetooth v4.0 stack - provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets) carried by humans. This fundamental design paradigm of BLE is enabled by a range of broadcast advertising modes. While its operational benefits are numerous, the lack of a common time reference in the broadcast mode of BLE has been a fundamental limitation. This work presents and describes CheepSync: a time synchronization service architecture for BLE advertisers. We implement CheepSync on custom designed nRF24Cheep beacon platforms (as broadcasters) and commercial off-the-shelf Android ported smartphones (as passive listeners); and show that the average (single hop) time synchronization accuracy is in the 10 mu s range.

Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a low power solution that provides a user-defined connection interval parameter for extending the sleep time of BLE nodes. Instead of minimizing the values for this connection parameter to minimize latency, which can lead to excessive energy consumption, this paper presents a practical energy-efficient scheduling framework for multiple BLE devices having applications with latency constraints. First, we determine the required connection interval for a single BLE node with multi-rate sensing applications. Then, considering the scheduling issues caused by non-preemptive data transmission, we present an energy-efficient connection interval assignment for a sensor network with multiple BLE nodes to meet the latency constraints of sensing applications. Finally, based on the proposed connection interval determination, we propose a priority inversion awareness scheduler for the BLE master node to schedule all slave node transmissions in the network. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithms prolonged network lifetime by 235% compared with a simple pessimistic setting.

Among the various protocol standards defined for IoT physical layer Bluetooth Low Energy is a promising one owing to its low power consumption. In this paper, a Viterbi algorithm based BLE receiver is proposed where a joint Viterbi detector and decoder is used rather than using two distinct Viterbi processors for detection and decoding. The proposed model is simulated using Scilab and from the simulation results it is evident that the BER requirement of BLE is met at a SNR value of 5dBm. The performance of the Viterbi algorithm based BLE receiver is found to be superior to other demodulation schemes used. The performance of BLE receiver using joint Viterbi detector and decoder is on par with the receiver model using two Viterbi processors.	[Nimisha, K.

New applications are possible such as activity and location tracking that allows health monitoring and increased access to health services. Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) is a pivotal technology for this vision, as it allows power-efficient network connections to smartphones and to service infrastructure. However, there are design flaws and implementation vulnerabilities in BLE that affect the most widely used chipsets and operating systems. In this paper, we present POSE, an end-to-end security layer, that can mitigate attacks on BLE pairing and link-layer communications. POSE uses protocol buffers for efficient message data serialization/deserialization and, on top of them, provides message confidentiality and authenticity, including message freshness. POSE was implemented and its processing time, packet overhead, and CPU usage were evaluated. The results show that POSE is an efficient solution for secure communication with wearables and other constrained devices, especially when they already use protocol buffers.

With the increase in the number of devices, the probability of congestion also increases in a network. Data channels of the BLE use frequency hopping, but it is not available for advertising channels. The capability of the BLE for providing a wide range of parameters settings ensures the impressive potential for BLE devices to customize their discovery latency. But communication before connection setup is not synchronous and both the scanning devices and the advertising devices are unaware of the timing parameters of each other. This can lead to inefficient advertiser device discovery. To resolve this issue, an algorithm is proposed to reduce the average latency per advertiser experienced due to the increase in the number of BLE devices in a vicinity. It is observed that the average latency has shown improvement in the range of 35% to 55%, depending on different simulated scenarios. Due to this improvement the overall energy consumption is also reduced.

This paper proposes the design and development of a low power portable ECG measurement device. The device uses three standard ECG electrodes placed on a human body to monitor the heart rhythm or arrhythmias. The measured signals are processed on-board for further processing and displayed on a smart device. A single-chip ECG signal-conditioning chip is used as an analogue frontend. The pre-processed signal is sampled by an analogue to digital signal converter peripheral, which is part of the Microcontroller (STM32L1) used for this application. Furthermore, the ECG signal is further processed on-board using DSP techniques for reliable measurement. The device uses the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network processor, which interfaces to the MCU. The processed raw data (ECG) samples are transmitted via the BLE medium for displaying and storing them on a smart device. The device also measures the heart rate as part of the on-board processing. Further, part of the measured data is validated against the clinically measured samples for verifications.

This study also performs a prevalidation of the athletes' physiological sensory data that is sent out by the same timing system-the BLE active communication technology. In order to verify the timing and positioning technology, 621 K records of static measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) were first collected. The trend of the RSSI between the location and the BLE Receiver when the runners carried a BLE Tag was analyzed. Then, the difference between the runners' passing timestamp and the runners' actual passing time when the runners carried a BLE Tag and ran past the BLE Receivers was dynamically recorded and analyzed. Additionally, the timing sensing rate when multiple runners ran past the BLE Receivers was verified. In order to confirm the accuracy of the time synchronization in the remote timing device, the timing error, synced by the Network Time Protocol (NTP), was analyzed. A global positioning system (GPS) signal was used to enhance the time synchronization's accuracy. Additionally, the timing devices were separated by 15 km, and it was verified that they remained within the timing error range of 1 ms. The BLE communication technology has at least one more battery requirement than traditional passive radio frequency identification (RFID) timing devices. Therefore, the experiment also verified that the BLE Tag of this system can continue to operate for at least 48 h under normal conditions. Based on the above experimental results, it is estimated that the system can provide a timing error of under +/- 156 ms for each athlete. The system can also meet the scale of the biggest international city marathon event.

Compared to classic Bluetooth, BLE has been simplified in many ways that include its connection establishment, data exchange, and encryption processes. Unfortunately, this simplification comes at a cost. For example, only a star topology is supported in BLE environments and a peripheral (an IoT device) can communicate with only one gateway (e.g., a smartphone, or a BLE hub) at any given set time. When a peripheral goes out of range and thus loses connectivity to a gateway, it cannot connect and seamlessly communicate with another gateway without user interventions. In other words, BLE connections are not automatically migrated or handed-off to another gateway. In this paper, we propose SeamBlue(1), which brings secure seamless connectivity to BLE-capable mobile IoT devices in an environment that consists of a network of gateways. Our framework ensures that unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf BLE devices seamlessly and securely connect to a nearby gateway without any user intervention.

Today's learning algorithms enable the deduction of models that describe complex system properties, e.g., timed or stochastic behavior. Despite recent improvements in the scalability of learning algorithms, their practical applicability is still an open issue. Little work exists that actually learns models of physical black-box systems. To fill this gap in the literature, we present a case study on applying automata learning on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. It shows that not the size of the system limits the applicability of automata learning. Instead, the interaction with the system under learning, is a major bottleneck that is rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a general automata learning architecture for learning a behavioral model of the BLE protocol implemented by a physical device. With this framework, we can successfully learn the behavior of five investigated BLE devices. The learned models reveal several behavioral differences. This shows that automata learning can be used for fingerprinting black-box devices, i.e., identifying systems via their specific learned models. Based on the fingerprint, an attacker may exploit vulnerabilities specific to a device.

To design energy-efficient devices, the protocol provides a number of parameters that need to be optimized within an energy, latency, and throughput design space. Therefore, an energy model that can predict the energy consumption of a BLE-based wireless device for different parameter value settings is needed. As BLE differs from the well-known Bluetooth Basic Rate (BR) significantly, models for Bluetooth BR cannot be easily applied to the BLE protocol. In past years, there have been a couple of proposals on energy models for BLE. However, none of them can model all the operating modes of the protocol. This article presents an energy model of the BLE protocol, which allows the computation of a device's power consumption in all possible operating modes. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is not only one of the most accurate ones known so far (because it accounts for all protocol parameters), but it is also the only one that models all the operating modes of BLE. Based on this model, guidelines for system designers are presented that help choose the right parameters for optimizing the energy consumption. The model is publicly available as a software library for download.

BLE is a new brand technology focused on information transmission using very low energy consumption. It is being included in mobile devices from year 2011, nowadays almost every new mobile phone is shipped with this technology. Robot localization using particles filter has been developed in recent years using wireless technologies with a significant success. BLE beacons measures are rather noisier than measures from similar wireless devices. In this work we make an initial model of BLE measures and their noise. The model is used to generate data to be processed by a particle filter designed for localization using only ultrawide band (UWB) beacons ranges. Data are generated with different noise level in order to explore localization errors behavior, these levels cover real noise levels founded in RSSI measure characterization.	[Cuadra-Troncoso, J.

Due to its unique properties of low power requirements and its ubiquitous availability in practically every smartphone, it outnumbered classic Bluetooth BR/EDR in most areas. It enabled a multitude of new product categories like smart watches or connected health care devices that would not be feasible without such a technology. We are currently facing version 5.2 of the specification which is the result of a number of major and minor revisions, each fixing problems of earlier versions while adding new features and capabilities. This includes more secure pairing methods, like secure connection pairing. Cyber security was considered from the beginning of the Bluetooth specification and has been improved with each specification release. On the other hand, security weaknesses in the specification as well as in individual Bluetooth stack implementations have been identified. Designing a secure BLE device, or analyzing its security is a complicated task due to the overwhelming number of possible configurations. As the specification introduces constantly new features and subtle changes regarding privacy and security, this will become an even more complex task. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic overview over the current state of BLE does exist that covers the security and privacy properties of the different BLE versions and features including known weaknesses and attacks in a single place. With this survey we want to fill this gap.

The sensor networks shall act as early warning systems for the set-in of initiating damage processes or if, e. g., moisture penetrates a structural element or any massive structure (embankments, dykes, dams) that allow for adverse and damaging substances penetrating structural elements. During first feasibility tests we applied commercially available multifunctional sensors like a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Module for investigation of the influence of moisture in a certain volume of building material on the received signal. The investigated parameters were the so-called Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Signal and the transmission power emitted by an embedded BLE-Module. The BLE-Module communicates with a mobile smart receiver as a tablet or a smartphone as s. c. SmartHub. The change of the RSS-Indicator is a measure for the damping as a result of changing moisture content in a structural element while the transmission power remains constant. While the BLE-Signal transfers a moist section in any material, eg. building material, the RSS-Indicator changes. After a successful feasibility study, a ZIM-project was confirmed, which was composed within the in the German Network MI4G (Modern Industry for Germany) between the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) with the small enterprise LinTech GmbH, Berlin. The report presents first results and gives an outlook on further research activities.

Most BLE-based mesh protocols are implemented as overlays on top of the standard Bluetooth star topologies while using piconets and scatternets. Nonetheless, mesh topology support has increased the vulnerability of BLE to security threats, since a larger number of devices can participate in a BLE Mesh network. To address these concerns, BLE version 5 enhanced existing BLE security features to deal with various authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality issues. However, there is still a lack of detailed studies related to these new security features. This survey examines the most recent BLE-based mesh network protocols and related security issues. In the first part, the latest BLE-based mesh communication protocols are discussed. The analysis shows that the implementation of BLE pure mesh protocols remains an open research issue. Moreover, there is a lack of auto-configuration mechanisms in order to support bootstrapping of BLE pure mesh networks. In the second part, recent BLE-related security issues and vulnerabilities are highlighted. Strong Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for detecting security breaches in order to protect against zero-day exploits. Nonetheless, viable IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks remain a nascent research area. Consequently, a comparative survey of IDS approaches for related low-power wireless protocols was used to map out potential approaches for enhancing IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks.

This paper studies the effect of construction materials on the localisation accuracy of an IPS based on trilateration using received signal strength indicators (RSSI) from BLE beacon nodes. Through experiments, we found that plasterboard walls and glass walls provide better localisation accuracy as compared to wooden walls.

As widely supported by wearable devices, BLE has the potential to become an alternative for indoor-localization and proximity sensing. The aim of this work was to perform a thorough characterization of the RSSI-distance relationship under controlled conditions using two BLE devices. Four calibration models underwent to a comparative evaluation analysis. The best results were obtained using a polynomial model with a mean distance percentage error equal to 25.7% (0.4 m) in the range 0-3 m. An overall improvement of 14.3% (0.24 m) in the distance estimate compared to the exponential model commonly adopted in the literature was reported.

The indoor positioning method using a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon has been considered challenging, owing to the deviation of the receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) value. In this paper, we propose an indoor location tracking method by adding an algorithm to reduce differences between the actual and predicted locations of moving objects. By using synthetic data generated from actual measured values, neural networks were trained and used to predict the location of the beacon. Also, an improved tracking algorithm of moving objects was proposed by considering the angle of rotation relative to the origin. Through the simulation, it was confirmed that the improved tracking results were obtained by applying the proposed tracking algorithm to the locations predicted by neural networks.

They are usually used to monitor health status, track fitness data, or even do medical tests, etc. Since the wearable devices can obtain a lot of personal data, their security issues are very important. Motivated by the consideration that the current pairing mechanisms of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are commonly impractical or insecure for many BLE based wearable devices nowadays, we design and implement a security framework in order to protect the communication between these devices. The security framework is a supplement to the Bluetooth pairing mechanisms and is compatible with all BLE based wearable devices. The framework is a module between the application layer and the GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) layer in the BLE architecture stack. When the framework starts, a client and a server can automatically and securely establish shared fresh keys following a designed protocol; the services of encrypting and decrypting messages are provided to the applications conveniently by two functions; application data are securely transmitted following another protocol using the generated keys. Prudential principles are followed by the design of the framework for security purposes. It can protect BLE based wearable devices from replay attacks, Man-in-The-Middle attacks, data tampering, and passive eavesdropping. We conduct experiments to show that the framework can be conveniently deployed with practical operational cost of power consumption. The protocols in this framework have been formally verified that the designed security goals are satisfied.

On top of the BLE stack, the Bluetooth Mesh profile canbe adopted to handle large networks with mesh topologies. BLE is a promising candidate for theimplemention of Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs), thanks to its wide diffusion (e.g., onsmartphones and tablets) and the lower cost of the devices compared to other wireless industrialcommunication technologies. However, neither the BLE nor the Bluetooth Mesh specifications canprovide real-time messages with bounded delays. To overcome this limitation, this work proposesRESEMBLE, a real-time stack developed on top of BLE that is able to realize low-cost IWSNs overmesh topologies. RESEMBLE offers support to both real-time and non-real-time communicationson the same network. Moreover, RESEMBLE provides clock synchronization, thus allowing forTime Division Multiple Access (TDMA) transmissions. The clock synchronization provided byRESEMBLE can be also exploited by the upper layers' industrial applications to implement timecoordinatedactions.

The BLE 4.0 protocol supports only the piconet topology and does not support data transfer over multiple nodes. To overcome this limitation a mechanism to relay sensor data over multiple BLE 4.0 nodes using Master/Slave switching was developed. The mechanism dynamically creates communication paths within the BLE ad-hoc sensor network where all BLE nodes are identical. The sensor data query is initiated from a designated node and forwarded through the dynamically build network. the sensor data are collected over the same path, back to the designated node. The mechanism does not perform route discovery therefore no routing tables are needed. Using this mechanism, the range of the sensor data acquisition can be extended from BLE range to whole BLE sensor network.

J	Pusnik, M; Galun, M; Sumak, B				Pusnik, Maja; Galun, Mitja; Sumak, Bostjan			Improved Bluetooth Low Energy Sensor Detection for Indoor Localization Services	SENSORS			English	Article						Internet of Things; IoT; Bluetooth Low Energy; BLE; iBeacon; indoor localization	INTERNET; THINGS	Advancements in protocols, computing paradigms, and electronics have enabled the development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with high potential for various location-based applications in different fields. One of the most important topics in WSNs is the localization in environments with sensor nodes being scattered randomly over a region. Localization techniques are often challenged by localization latency, efficient energy consumption, accuracy, environmental factors, and others. The objective of this study was to improve the technique for detecting the nearest Bluetooth Low Energy sensor, which would enable the development of more efficient mobile applications for location advertising at fairs, exhibitions, and museums. The technique proposed in this study was based on the iBeacon protocol, and it was tested in a controlled room with three environmental settings regarding the density of obstacles, as well as in a real-world setting at the Expo Museum at Postojna in Slovenia. The results of several independent measures, conducted in the controlled room and in the real-world environment, showed that the proposed algorithm outperformed the standard algorithm, especially in the environments with a medium or high densities of obstacles. The results of this study can be used for the more effective planning of placing beacons in space and for optimizing the algorithms for detecting transmitters in mobile location-based applications that provide users with contextual information based on their current location.

Several existing works already exploited to provide an acoustic streaming service over IP, LTE, Bluetooth and even Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Due to the different communication mechanism from IP, in case of Bluetooth and BLE, it is impossible to provide direct communication. To offer the advantage of IP communication over BLE device, 6lo WG over BLE is in progress. Based on 6lo BLE, we introduce our prototype of acoustic data streaming service over IP enabled BLE. We evaluate our service with various metrics such as packet loss, latency and throughput. The results show the various performance of BLE-IP device.

The simplified link control layer and concise packet structure make it very appealing to low power applications with medium data rate requirement. However, the very short preamble of a BLE packet is also present as a new design challenge. In such a burst data communication scenario, a short preamble means that only a very short time interval is allowed to adjust the gain of the receiver analog front end to condition the input signal strength to a proper level for decent demodulation in the digital baseband. Aiming at this problem, a fast convergence two-stage automatic gain control (AGC) loop is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is explained in details, and the performance is verified via simulation.

The communication latencies were realistically modeled, using a dataset of measurements collected from a real device. The results show an achievable positioning accuracy of about 1 mm, significantly improving with respect to an unsynchronized Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) positioning system, supervised using a BLE protocol [1].

BLE is also increasingly used in critical infrastructure applications, primarily in wireless sensor networks (WSN) for healthcare and environmental monitoring. While much research addresses the implementation and resiliency of these types of networks, little research focuses on detection of attacks on WSN sensors. To that extent, research that focuses on detection of attacks on BLE devices is lacking. Furthermore, BLE security research lags behind attack tool development. The general lack of security has led to recent development of two separate BLE man-in-the-middle frameworks, a privacy-violating BLE localization tool, and successful attacks on 12 commercially available BLE locks. To enable post-production updates, several vendors include the capability to alter device firmware over-the-air using BLE. Unfortunately, the standard service used for this purpose does not require authentication and has no built-in security. Consequently, a malicious actor can exploit the update mechanism to download malware to a target BLE device. This work contributes to the field of WSN and BLE security by illustrating an example attack methodology through a firmware exploit on a BLE industrial monitor. The attack vector is presented in its entirety, from target selection and enumeration to exploitation and malware deployment. Challenges in detection for this attack are presented from the perspective of a peripheral, end user, and third-party traffic sniffer. An experiment is designed to illustrate an additional challenge with sniffer-based detection, where some sniffers become less effective at capturing traffic over time. A mechanism for firmware recovery is proposed, emphasizing its difficulty for a normal end user, and further motivating the need for attack detection mechanisms. Finally, actionable steps are provided for vendors and end users to help defend BLE devices and enhance application security.

This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 mu s, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.

For WAHN, there are many available technologies such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, Threads, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) etc. Despite of the improvements in IoT technologies, multicasting pure mesh-based routing is still a major problem that needs to be resolved. In view of the aforesaid, this research will propose a multicast mesh-based communication network architecture and protocol having topology auto-configuration features. Subsequently, for this study, the use case will be the hospital (being the most critical place dealing with emergencies). Furthermore, for the aforesaid use case, the BLE is supposed to be the most suitable technology being low power and easily available (in smart phone and gadgets). Initially, the BLE was introduced in Bluetooth version 4.0 and its features got matured in the advance version 4.2 and 5. BLE 5 has the capability for mesh topology that has increased the network coverage and enhanced end to end diversity of the Bluetooth based ad-hoc networks. Likewise, in this paper, the emphasis will be on proposing a pure mesh-based routing protocol capable of multicasting and topology autoconfiguration for BLE 5 enabled network for the hospital.

J	Nikodem, M; Bawiec, M				Nikodem, Maciej; Bawiec, Marek			Experimental Evaluation of Advertisement-Based Bluetooth Low Energy Communication	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; advertising mode; Internet of Things; large-scale system; system validation; experimental evaluation		This paper addresses the efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication in a network composed of a large number of tags that transmit information to a single hub using advertisement mode. Theoretical results show that the use of advertisements enables hundreds and thousands of BLE devices to coexist in the same area and at the same time effectively transmit messages. Together with other properties (low power consumption, medium communication range, capability to detect a signal's angle-of-arrival, etc.), this makes BLE a competing technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, as the number of communicating devices increases, the advertisement collision intensifies and the communication performance of BLE drops. This phenomena was so far analyzed theoretically, in simulations and in small-scale experiments, but large-scale experiments are not presented in the literature. This paper complements previous results and presents an experimental evaluation of a real IoT-use case, which is the deployment of over 200 tags communicating using advertisements. We evaluate the impact of the number of advertisements on the effective data reception rate and throughput. Despite the advertisement collision rate in our experiment varying between 0.22 and 0.33, we show that BLE, thanks to the multiple transmission of advertisements, can still ensure acceptable data reception rates and fulfill the requirements of a wide range of IoT applications.

The developed posture monitoring system obtains the orientation in space of each body segment in which the sensor nodes are placed and calculates the trunk angle, the knee angle and the angle of inclination of the road. Raw sensor data are collected periodically from accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes and sent via BLE to an Android smartphone, which plays the role of central station and performs the data processing concerning the posture calculation. We describe the development of the hardware and software of the sensor nodes, which are based on the CC2540 BLE system-on-chip, as well as the development of the Android application, and provide experimental results concerning the measurement of the posture of a cyclist in order to validate the proposed system.

However, IPS is also a challenging topic that has a number of stringent requirements, such as cost, energy efficiency, availability and accuracy. The development of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) iBeacon has opened great opportunities for researchers to solve those challenges. In this paper, we present our iBeacon based positioning system, which we built as an application running on iOS platform. We also present Fingerprinting - the main positioning technique used in our system, in which we configure its fingerprints to improve accuracy. With that, a machine learning algorithm called k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) is applied to extract the most probable user location. In addition, we also use Kalman Filter in order to enhance the stability of iBeacon's signal. Our system results in a 60% - 71.4% accuracy rate and an error of up to 1.6 m, which is acceptable in IPS.

OBJECTVE: We developed three iPhone 5 applications for an RTLS and communications using Bluetooth low energy (BLE). METHODS: The applications were: Peripheral device tags, Central beacons, and a Monitor. A Peripheral communicated with a Central using BLE. The Central communicated with a Monitor using sockets on TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) via a WLAN (wireless local area network). To determine a BLE threshold level for the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), relationships between signal strength and distance were measured in our laboratory and on the terrace. RESULTS: The BLE RSSI threshold was set at -70 dB, about 10 m. While an individual with a Peripheral moved around in a concrete building, the Peripheral was captured in a few 10-sec units at about 10 m from a Central. The Central and Monitor showed and saved the approach events, location, and Peripheral's nickname sequentially in real time. Remote Centrals also interactively communicate with Peripherals by intermediating through Monitors that found the nickname in the event database. CONCLUSIONS: Trial applications using BLE on iPhones worked well for patient tracking, and messaging in indoor environments.

Although, nonconnectable beacons are the most energy-efficient advertising mode of BLE, no synchronization service is defined for them in the BLE standard. Here, we present BlueSync, a BLE compatible time synchronization protocol, which uses beacons for data transfer. As part of this study, we investigate the tradeoffs between energy efficiency, synchronization error, and speed by considering different drift-management methods and various synchronization packet configurations. Additionally, we propose a Discrete Adjustment technique that can improve energy efficiency in calculating timer ticks updates up to 15x without sacrificing accuracy. BlueSync is implemented on two commercial BLE system on chips and tested in 10-min long sessions without any resynchronization. Experimental results show that depending on the settings, BlueSync can achieve average synchronization errors as low as 320 ns per 60 s (single hop) and is the most accurate time synchronization reported on BLE to date.

It has various use cases, including building occupancy detection, automated asset tracking in construction sites, supporting facility maintenance and operations, and guiding people in building emergency response operations. Although some initial studies examining the usability of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor localization exist in the literature, there is still a gap for a comprehensive analysis that will lead to the establishment of a widely accepted BLE-based localization framework. Whereas existing studies mainly focus on radio signal properties and use only spatial accuracy and precision as their evaluation criteria, this study determines the technological viability of BLE through predetermined guidance parameters such as human body orientation, number of data collection points, number of real-time received signal strength index (RSSI) data samples, and fingerprinting creation approaches. In order to determine the viability of BLE-based localization, multiple field experiments are carried out in the building of a research center. Location fingerprinting method is used as the wireless localization technique and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to assess the feasibility of BLE technology for indoor localization. The results of the field experiments show that BLE technology can be used as a reliable solution for indoor localization because it gives better accuracy and precision results than existing approaches in the industry.

The infrastructure in the vehicles detects the passengers' presence and initiates services unnoticed in the background. Whereas first implementations of BIBO systems are based on active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), where users carry small RFID-tags in their pockets, we focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as an alternative but potentially more powerful technology for this domain. We try to carve out differences, accentuate arising opportunities for interaction and evidence the applicability of BLE for BIBO systems by a series of conducted screening tests.

In these methods, the received signal strength (RSS) is the input. However, the measurement of indoor environments is affected easily; the signal may be reflected and attenuated by obstacles such as the human body, walls, and furniture, which creates a challenge for methods based on signal mapping. In this study, BLE signal characteristics are investigated in an indoor localization setting. An experiment is performed using one BLE beacon and multiple receivers installed at different wall and ceiling positions. The raw RSS is observed, and the relationship between the BLE beacon signal strength characteristics against the human body effect as well as the receiver's placement in the observation area are discussed. Signal mapping is performed, where the signal strength is measured from all receivers simultaneously. The position estimation accuracy is examined based on different data scenarios. The results show that the estimation position estimated by the BLE beacon based on extensive BLE beacon data does not affect the estimation accuracy.

Neighbor discovery is critical in BLE communications. BLE uses multiple (three) channels in neighbor discovery. It is challenging to achieve low-latency and low-energy-consumption BLE neighbor discovery due to the lack of analytical models for multichannel neighbor discovery. In this paper, we study BLE multichannel neighbor discovery for two advertising modes specified by BLE: periodic deterministic advertising (PDA) and pseudo-random delay advertising (RDA). We build two generic models, BLE 3-Circle model and BLE 1-Circle model, for characterizing BLE multichannel neighbor discovery. For PDA mode, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for BLE multichannel neighbor discovery, and provide a guideline for parameter setting. With the guideline, we derive the expected discovery latency in closed form, and demonstrate that the expected discovery latency is very close to a theoretical lower bound. For RDA mode, we build an analytical model based on Markov chain to accurately compute the expected discovery latency. Simulation and experimental results show accuracy of our analytical works. Interestingly, our parameter setting guideline works well for both PDA and RDA modes.

Nowadays, it is measured in clinical environments where it is impossible to keep track of all patients due to the lack of resources. The development of GS measurement systems for in-home environments could solve this problem, but current methods present, at least, one of these problems: they require expensive hardware, are intrusive for the patient, or are imprecise. A novel method to measure GS in these scenarios using Bluetooth Low Energy and smart wearable devices is proposed in this work.

The challenge of utilizing BLE in indoor localization is the characteristic of the observation area where multipath fading, shadowing, interference, and reflection of signal would appear. This paper proposed a new approach of evaluating the performance of wireless device communication system using BLE module in an indoor environment in term of estimating the position of the device using localization technique. Linear Regression method is used to refine the modeling distance parameter which measured previously. The simulation result shows that combining Linear Regression and Lognormal shadowing method for distance modeling will enhance the accuracy up to 99%.

The MCL was upgraded from Markov localization, with both belonging to the family of probabilistic approaches. Throughout the last decade, laser rangefinders and gyroscopes have been applied to MCL-based robotic localization systems with remarkable success. However, the utilization of MCL-based indoor localization for mobile devices, by applying Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors, is still being researched. In this paper, we present a technique that utilizes MCL that exploits two sensors, namely, the accelerometer and compass, with commonly deployed BLE beacons to localize people with mobile devices indoors. Experimental results illustrate that, by applying MCL with BLE beacons using an accelerometer and compass, the error of the calculated coordinates for the user position is less than 1 m in line of-sight (LOS) environments, while in a complex non-LOS environment, the average error is 3 m. Meanwhile, the proposed MCL system does not demand a high deployment density of BLE beacons compared with triangulation and trilateration-based indoor positioning algorithms.

Such networks are being increasingly used to acquire sensory data that need to be processed in real-time. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is an attractive solution for implementing low-cost IWSN with reduced energy consumption and high flexibility. However, the current BLE standard does not provide real-time support for data packets and is limited to a star topology. This paper presents a real-time protocol for industrial wireless mesh networks that is developed on top of the BLE and overcomes these limitations.

Indeed, the availability of systems, techniques and algorithms for localization allows the improvement of existing communication applications and services by adding position information. Some examples can be found in the managing of people and/or robots for internal logistics in very large warehouses (e.g., Amazon warehouses, etc.). In this paper, we study and develop a system allowing the accurate indoor localization of people visiting a museum or any other cultural institution. We assume visitors are equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device (commonly found in modern smartphones or in a small chipset), periodically transmitting packets, which are received by geolocalized BLE receivers inside the museum area. Collected packets are provided to the locator server to estimate the positions of the visitors inside the museum. The position estimation is based on a feed-forward neural network trained by a measurement campaign in the considered environment and on a non-linear least square algorithm. We also provide a strategy for deploying the BLE receivers in a given area. The performance results obtained from measurements show an achievable position estimate accuracy below 1 m.

Traditional optical lens manufacturing companies must enable the operator and customers to grasp the progress of optical lens production, a goal that the global manufacturing industry has been now pursuing. This study incorporates an IPS design into the manufacturing and processing procedures of optical lenses and uses an indoor positioning algorithm to calculate location-based information to achieve effective indoor positioning. Therefore, in this paper, this study proposes that using Bluetooth low energy sensors to perform signal strength fingerprinting identification can increase the accuracy of positioning. The results reveal that the proposed method can attain a certain level of accuracy in indoor positioning, and integrated into the optical lens production management systems, to achieve optical lens smart manufacturing.

The sensor is able to acquire up to three independent bioelectrical channels (six electrodes), each with 24 bits of resolution and a sampling rate up to 3.2 kHz, and has a 6-DoF inertial platform measuring linear acceleration and angular velocity. The bluetooth low-energy wireless link was chosen because it allows easy interfacing with many consumer electronics devices, such as smartphones or tablets, that can work as data aggregators, but also imposes data rate restrictions. These restrictions are investigated in this paper as well, together with the strategy we adopted to maximize the available bandwidth and reliability of the transmission within the limits imposed by the protocol.

With help of this information, it is possible to realize important real world tasks, for instance, context aware service, automation of common tasks and so on. Recently, there have been many studies on the indoor proximity detection with BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) and various techniques such as filtering and curve fitting have been suggested for the improvement of accuracy. However, those techniques are not adequate for the accurate indoor proximity detection, which limit the usable space and increase the error detection rate.

This has resulted in an increase in the number, weight and complexity of wiring as well as wiring harness for in-vehicle communication networks. Reducing the amount of cables will improve fuel efficiency; reduce cost of manufacturing and maintenance of vehicles greatly. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a great candidate for cable replacement given its supported data rates and widespread adoption in many markets. BLE device discovery is required to establish the presence of nodes within each other's communication range and begin reliable exchange of data. In our system, the nodes are the sensors and actuators. The fundamental problem in such device discovery is that energy consumption and discovery latency are inversely related. Therefore an efficient trade-off BLE connection setup that reduces energy-consumption while being able to provide worst-case discovery latency guarantees is critical especially in the automotive industry. We propose a mechanism that exploits Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to provide worst-case latency guarantees during the connection setup phase of BLE devices. We provide the required modifications in BLE as well as provide evaluation results to show the improved performance. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that considers providing bounded-latency connection setup for BLE devices using CRT and its application for automotive cable replacement.

In order to accurately assess the vulnerability of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless network enabled IoT systems, we have proposed a novel approach to extend the calculation formula for Authentication which is one of variables used in the conventional base score equations of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v2 proposed by the National Infrastructure Advisory Council. Through an example BLE wireless network based shopping cart IoT system we have demonstrated the weakness of the current CVSS v2 base score equations and how to overcome the weakness through our extension.

This paper describes design and implementation of low cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) IoT solution for management of farm animals, which can count, identify, and localize animals in the farm. It is aimed at enhancing livestock welfare and production. The solution uses wearable animal collar and central devices capable of communicating information pertaining to specific animals to a central BLE device. Collected data is analysed and displayed locally to a user. Therefore, we report the development process of the solution, experiments on the technology and results.

J	Jeon, WS; Jeong, DG				Jeon, Wha Sook; Jeong, Dong Geun			Enhanced Channel Access for Connection State of Bluetooth Low Energy Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy; connection state; data channel access scheme; Markov analysis	TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEM; IOT	According to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) specifications, a pair of connected devices (master and slave) should sleep whenever packet transmission is failed twice consecutively, although they still have packets to be sent. However, when BLE devices are densely deployed in a small geographical area, such sleeping can occur frequently, and as a result, the BLE performance can be degraded largely. Moreover, when considering that a message consists of multiple packets in many Internet of things (IoT) applications, the situation gets worse because the master and slave of BLE alternately have the transmission opportunity not in the unit of message but in the unit of packet. In this paper, we suggest two enhancements of data channel access for improving the BLE performance by making up the above-mentioned weaknesses: One is to continue packet transmission by avoiding bad-quality channel via channel hopping instead of sleeping; the other is a message-based alternation of transmission opportunity between master and slave. We formulate a Markov model for analyzing the performance of the proposed scheme and derive a closed-form solution. The numerical results demonstrate that, from the proposed two enhancements, the throughput and delay performances of BLE are remarkably improved with a slight increase of consumed energy.

In the our previous work, the couple RFID passive tags were installed on motorcycles to detect the larceny conditions. The main problem was found in the last experiments that the RFID tags attached with the ignition key cannot be hung flexibly. Therefore, the BLE4.0, which is the low-power-consumption device, is dangle on the motorcycle's key and the RFID tags is installed on the bike's hidden body. The anti lost devices have been applied for responsibility of BLE-tags slave mode, installed on a key. The HM-11 BLE 4.0 module combination with an Arduino board has a function as the master mode, reading the MAC address (called ID) of BLE slave devices. The results show that the maximum distance, in which the BLE master module can detect the BLE slave's ID, is approximately 18 meters. The proposed method is reliable because the BLE devices can be hung on the key together while the motorbike is running on the speed not over than 80km/hr. Finally, the experimental results guarantee that, when relatively compared with the previous method, accuracy of the MATS is improved efficiently; moreover, this proposed system can actually be used in the real situation at the Prachinburi province, Thailand.

For a lot of these systems, acquisition of context-sensitive information about attendant people has evolved to a key challenge. Especially the position and distribution of attendants significantly influence the system's service quality. To meet this challenge, several types of sensor systems have been presented over the last two decades. Most of these systems rely on an active mobile device that has to be carried by the tracked entity. Contrary to the so-called device-based active systems, device-free passive sensing systems are grounded on the idea of detecting, tracking, and identifying attendant people without carrying any active device or to actively taking part in a localization process. In order to obtain information about the position or the distribution of present people, these systems quantify the impact of the physical attendants on radio-frequency signals. Most of device-free systems rely on the existing WiFi infrastructure and device-based active concepts, but here we want to focus on a different approach. In line with our previous research on presence detection with Bluetooth Low Energy beacons, in this paper, we introduce a strategy of using those beacons for a device-free passive human counting system.

The standard defines Bluetooth Classic (BT) for high-throughput wireless services and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) very low-power ones. The standard also specifies security mechanisms, such as pairing, session establishment, and cross-transport key derivation (CTKD). CTKD enables devices to establish BT and BLE security keys by pairing just once. CTKD was introduced in 2014 with Bluetooth 4.2 to improve usability. However, the security implications of CTKD were not studied carefully. This work demonstrates that CTKD is a valuable and novel Bluetooth attack surface. It enables, among others, to exploit BT and BLE just by targeting one of the two (i.e., Bluetooth cross-transport exploitation). We present the design of the first cross-transport attacks on Bluetooth. Our attacks exploit issues that we identified in the specification of CTKD. For example, we find that CTKD enables an adversary to overwrite pairing keys across transports. We leverage these vulnerabilities to impersonate, machine-in-the-middle, and establish unintended sessions with any Bluetooth device supporting CTKD. Since the presented attacks blur the security boundary between BT and BLE, we name them BLUR attacks. We provide a low-cost implementation of the attacks and test it on a broad set of devices. In particular, we successfully attack 16 devices with 14 unique Bluetooth chips from popular vendors (e.g., Cypress, Intel, Qualcomm, CSR, Google, and Samsung), with Bluetooth standard versions of up to 5.2. We discuss why the countermeasures in the Bluetooth are not effective against our attacks, and we develop and evaluate practical and effective alternatives.

In this paper we investigate the potential of BLE in a vehicular context. By means of experiments, we first evaluate the characteristics of the wireless channel, then we define a set of driving scenarios to analyse how BLE is affected by varying speed, distance and traffic conditions. We found that the maximum communication range between two devices can go beyond 100 m and that a robust connection, capable of handling sudden signal losses or interferences, can be achieved up to a distance of 50 m even for varying traffic and driving conditions. We then present a proof-of-concept mobile application for off-the-shelf smartphones that can be used to transmit data over multiple hops. Next, we analyse how BLE handles other interferences on the same frequency band by building and validating an interference testbed based on the IEEE 802.11 technology. Finally we discuss the advantages and limitations of BLE for Inter-Vehicular Communications (IVC) and propose potential applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As part of the service discovery mechanism of BLE, devices announce themselves by broadcasting radio signals called advertisement packets that can be collected with off-the-shelf hardware and software. To avoid the risk of tracking based on those messages, BLE features an address randomization mechanism that substitutes the device address with random temporary pseudonyms, called Private addresses. In this paper, we analyze the privacy issues associated with the advertising mechanism of BLE, leveraging a large dataset of advertisement packets collected in the wild. First, we identified that some implementations fail at following the BLE specifications on the maximum lifetime and the uniform distribution of random identifiers. Furthermore, we found that the payload of the advertisement packet can hamper the randomization mechanism by exposing counters and static identifiers. In particular, we discovered that advertising data of Apple and Microsoft proximity protocols can be used to defeat the address randomization scheme. Finally, we discuss how some elements of advertising data can be leveraged to identify the type of device, exposing the owner to inventory attacks.

As Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely deployed in smart tags, smart-phones, and smart-devices, adding functionality to support localization and asset tracking is crucial. In order to locate a device, either the angle or range to the device needs to be calculated. In this paper, we focus on a phase-based solution to calculate the range between devices. We introduce a multicarrier phase-based ranging solution compatible with the BLE standard that utilizes BLE channel hopping to exchange tones in the entire 2.4 GHz frequency band to mitigate the multi-path fading problem. We recognize that in the BLE standard, slow channel-hopping, long packet size and frame spacing between two consecutive communications (named T_IFS) affect ranging error/accuracy, in the case of crystal offset and phase-noise. Therefore, we introduce a new mathematical model to analyze the impact of the BLE link layer protocol on the ranging error. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of our proposed solution through modelling, by considering the results of real experiments and by validating the correctness of our mathematical model for the ranging error.

Therefore, the construction machines can be controlled through commands sent via the network to improve productivity. This is called i-construction. Two examples of i-construction are remote control and automatic control systems for the construction machine. In these systems, generally, wireless communication is used. However, the wireless communication characteristics that need to be considered in i-construction are still unclear. In order to clarify, this paper seeks to characterize the characteristics of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication when used in construction machines. In the evaluations, we use a BLE beacon module. Experimental results show that the BLE beacon module can communicate between the sender in the excavator's attachment and receiver in the cabin. The results show that there is a possibility that the wireless communication systems can be applied for the construction machines.

In addition, BLE is in almost every smartphone, turning it into perfect ubiquitous remote controls for smart homes, buildings or cities. In this paper we propose new operating modes for BLE to provide a much wider applicability range covering asynchronous, aperiodic and very low frequency scenarios while extending lifetime, without modification of the existing BLE specification. In order to estimate battery lifetime, we propose a coin cell battery model. We show how to efficiently adapt the protocol for different IoT scenarios based on their requirements, thus extending battery lifetime as much as possible while guaranteeing acceptable latency. Our results on two typical test-cases show that by using an optimized configuration and appropriate operating mode based on scenario requirements, lifetime can be increased up to approximate to 2x (4.1 to 7.3 years) for a BLE master in a first case, and approximate to 58x (3.05 months to 14.82 years) for a BLE slave in a second case. This shows BLE compatibility with a vast amount of IoT-related use cases.

Physical Unclonable Keys for Smart Lock Systems using Bluetooth Low Energy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IECON 2016 - 42ND ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 24-27, 2016	Florence, ITALY	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		Bluetooth Low Energy; Physical unclonable functions; PUFs; Security applications; Electronic systems on chip		Nowadays, several smart lock systems use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to stablish a wireless communication between the physical key (key fob, card, smartphone, etc.) and the lock. Security is based on creating and storing secret digital keys to establish a cryptographically secure communication. The problem is that several attacks can break such security, particularly the copy of the physical key. In order to increase the difficulty of the attacks, the physical keys described in this paper do not store the secret cryptographic keys but reconstruct them when they are needed and remove them when they are not used. Only the trusted physical keys are able to reconstruct the secrets with the public data stored in them. This is possible by using the start-up values of the SRAM in the BLE chip of the physical key, which acts as a physical unclonable function (PUF), so that if the physical key is copied, the lock cannot be opened. The idea has been proven with the development of a smart lock system with key fobs based on the CC2541 BLE system on chip from Texas Instruments. Experimental results are included to illustrate the performance.	[Prada-Delgado, M.

BlueVoice: Voice communications over Bluetooth Low Energy in the Internet of Things scenario	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Internet of Things; Bluetooth Low Energy; Speech services		Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) is a key technology in the envisioned Internet of Things (IoT) scenario. In fact, its extremely low-power characteristics make it one of the most suitable solutions to enable wireless communications among battery powered IoT objects ubiquitously deployed in the field with the aim of building smart environments. Although Bluetooth LE specification targets a specific set of applications mainly devoted to monitoring purposes, innovative solutions can lead to the adoption of such technology in different applications, such as multimedia streaming, allowing IoT objects to exploit new functionalities. In this direction this article presents BlueVoice, an application targeted to Bluetooth LE devices to enable speech streaming services. In the article BlueVoice is presented by first detailing the services set extension needed to support the new envisioned multimedia service, then a description of application choices is given, followed by an evaluation of its performance in real IoT objects. Thanks to the selected speech encoding technique, connection design choices and packetization strategies, BlueVoice application requires a communication bandwidth of 64.3 kbps to transmit audio at 16 kHz in ADPCM format. BlueVoice performance has been evaluated in terms of power consumption, memory and processing requirements, showing feasibility of the developed solution in resource constrained devices, thus confirming the correct choices in the application design. The set of performance information obtained show that BlueVoice is a viable solution to enable speech communications in ubiquitous wireless IoT nodes based on the Bluetooth LE technology.

In this context, wireless transmission plays a key role, and among available solutions, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is gaining more and more popularity. BLE merges together good performance, low-energy consumption and widespread diffusion. The aim of this work is to review the main methodologies adopted to investigate BLE performance. The first part of this review is an in-depth description of the protocol, highlighting the main characteristics and implementation details. The second part reviews the state of the art on BLE characteristics and performance. In particular, we analyze throughput, maximum number of connectable sensors, power consumption, latency and maximum reachable range, with the aim to identify what are the current limits of BLE technology. The main results can be resumed as follows: throughput may theoretically reach the limit of similar to 230 kbps, but actual applications analyzed in this review show throughputs limited to similar to 100 kbps; the maximum reachable range is strictly dependent on the radio power, and it goes up to a few tens of meters; the maximum number of nodes in the network depends on connection parameters, on the network architecture and specific device characteristics, but it is usually lower than 10; power consumption and latency are largely modeled and analyzed and are strictly dependent on a huge number of parameters. Most of these characteristics are based on analytical models, but there is a need for rigorous experimental evaluations to understand the actual limits.

Most previous BLE performance studies in the literature have focused primarily in networks with a single slave (point-to-point link) or traffic scenarios with relatively low data rate. However, many BAN sensors generate high data rate traffic, and several sensor nodes (slaves) may be actively sending data in the same BAN. Therefore, this work focuses on the evaluation of the suitability of BLE mainly under these conditions. Results show that, for the same traffic, the BLE protocol presents lower energy consumption and supports more sensor nodes than an alternative IEEE 802.15.4-based protocol. This study also identifies and characterizes some implementation constraints on the tested platforms that impose limits on the achievable performance.

Smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is one of the widely-adopted localization techniques with limiting problems such as the drift of inertial sensors. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has better performance result which makes it an auxiliary tool for PDR to correct errors. But BLE fingerprint sampling and calibrating are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm based crowdsourcing method is developed and applied to generate BLE landmarks instead of manual work leveraging smartphone sensors and uploaded BLE signals. A particle filter is also used to fusion PDR and landmarks detection results for better localization performance. The experiments show that the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the accuracy of 3.15 m at 90% of the time with dense landmarks (1 landmark per 5 m), which performs 51.76% better than 6.53 m from PDR algorithm. With sparse landmarks (1 landmark per 15 m), the proposed fusion algorithm achieved the accuracy of 3.26 m at 90% of the time.

Physical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity are measured by employing sensors sited across the monitored area. The parametric data is transmitted to the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller from the sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The cloud performs real time intelligence operations based on periodic sensor inputs obtained from the farm and transmits control commands to the microcontroller. The novelty of the system lies in the use of BLE and in the intelligence provided by the cloud. The physically monitored, as well as virtually obtained parameters, at the cloud level allow intelligent command generation, facilitated by a data exchange system that leverages the existing telecom network prevalent in developing countries. Based on the cloud commands, the ATmega328P microcontroller controls the operation time period of the irrigation system thus conserving both water and energy. The approximate cost of implementing the proof of concept system elaborated in this paper by using off the shelf components at retail price is about USD 16. It is expected that the system cost will further reduce on mass production and commercialization.

A lot of work has been done in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in recent years. Efforts to make efficient, low cost, scalable and easily deployable WSN have been on going. In order to reduce cost and improve life of a sensor node, it is necessary to optimize battery usage and power consumption. This paper looks at BLE as a potential candidate to reduce power in IOTWSN.

BLE mitigates interference via Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH), spreading communication over the entire spectrum. However, the ever-growing number of BLE devices and WiFi traffic in the already crowded 2.4 GHz band lead to situations where the quality of BLE connections dynamically changes with nearby wireless traffic, location, and time of day. These dynamic environments demand new approaches for channel management in AFH, by both dynamically excluding frequencies suffering from localized interference and adaptively re-including channels, thus providing sufficient channel diversity to survive the rise of new interference. We introduce eAFH, a new channel-management approach in BLE with a strong focus on efficient channel re-inclusion. eAFH introduces informed exploration as a driver for inclusion: using only past measurements, eAFH assesses which frequencies we are most likely to benefit from re-inclusion into the hopping sequence. As a result, eAFH adapts in dynamic scenarios where interference varies over time. We show that eAFH achieves 98-99.5% linklayer reliability in the presence of dynamic WiFi interference with 1% control overhead and 40% higher channel diversity than state-of-the-art approaches.

The proposed PHY, which is referred to as Narrow-band WiFi (NB-WiFi) can be supported by an OFDM transceiver available in an IEEE 802.11 access point (AP). In addition, NB-WiFi supports concurrent use of low data rate IoT application and high data rate broadband using IEEE 802.11ax technology, based on a single IFFT/FFT in the AP. In the sensor node, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) hardware can be reused, making it suitable for dual mode implementation of BLE and NB-WiFi. The performance of the proposed PHY is simulated for an AWGN channel, and it achieves about 10 dB improved sensitivity compared to a typical BLE receiver, due to the lower data rate.

Most current approaches use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to track locations. When using the RSSI to track indoor locations, devices need to be calibrated to account for complex interference patterns, which is a laborious process. Our aim was to investigate an alternative method for indoor location tracking of a moving user using BLE beacons in dynamic indoor environments. Methods and Materials: We developed a new method based on the received number of signals indicator (RNSI) and compared it to a standard RSSI-based method for predicting a user's location. Experiments were performed in an office environment and a tertiary hospital. Both RNSI and RSSI were compared at various distances from BLE beacons. In moving user experiments, a user wearing a beacon walked from one location to another based on a pre-defined route. Performance in predicting user locations was measured based on accuracy. Results: RNSI values decreased substantially with distance from the BLE beacon than RSSI values. Moving user experiments in the office environment demonstrated that the RNSI-based method produced higher accuracy (80.0%) than the RSSI-based method (76.2%). In the hospital, where the environment may introduce signal quality problems due to increased signal interference, the RNSI-based method still outperformed (83.3%) the RSSI-based method (51.9%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the RNSI-based method could be useful to track the locations of a moving user without involving complex calibration, especially when deploying within a new environment. RNSI has the potential to be used together with other methods in more robust indoor positioning systems.

The parameter values used during neighbor discovery directly affect the performance of the NDP. Therefore, an optimal parameter setting is essential to achieve the best tradeoff between discovery latency and energy consumption. An analytical model can offer a beneficial guideline for such a parameter selection. In this paper, we propose a general model for analyzing the performance of NDP in BLE networks. In the model, the operations of the scanner and the advertiser, which are two main components of NDP, are expressed on the discrete-time axis. Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), the discovery latency and energy consumption of advertiser are derived. The numerical results from our model are almost the same as the simulation results, for any parameter values specified by the standard. When considering that BLE is one of candidate communication technologies for IoT, the proposed model is expected to be very useful in setting the default or initial values of NDP parameters for various IoT applications.

In this paper, we study the effect of BLE protocols and channels on indoor positioning using different distance and similarity measures in a controlled environment. With the aim of reproducing a real positioning system situation, we also study the effect of the user's orientation in the positioning phase and, consequently, provide accuracy and precision results for each orientation. In a 168-m(2) testbed, 12 beacons configured to broadcast with the Eddystone and iBeacon protocols were deployed and 40 distance/similarity measures were considered. According to our results, in a specific orientation there is a group of distance metrics coupled with a protocol-channel combination that produces similar accuracy results. Therefore, choosing the right distance metric in that specific orientation is not as critical as choosing the right protocol and, especially, the right channel. There is a trend whereby the protocol-channel combination that provides the best accuracy is almost unique for each orientation. Depending on the orientation, the accuracies obtained for the abovementioned group of distances are within the range of 1.1-1.5 m and the precisions are 90% within the range of 1.5-2.5 m.

Prior studies show that there are always concerns about how to avoid signal occlusion and interference in the single indoor environment. However, we find some general rules to support our system being immune to interference generated by occlusion in the multi-indoor environment. A convenient way is measured to deploy Bluetooth low energy devices, which mainly collect large information to assist localization. A neural network-based classification is proposed to improve localization accuracy, compared with several algorithms and their performance comparison is discussed. We also design a distributed data storage structure and establish a platform considering the storage load with Redis. Our real experimental validation shows that our system will meet the four aspects of performance requirements, which are higher accuracy, less power consumption, and increased levels of system magnitude and deployment efficiency.

The sparse-training data is extracted from the database including enough data for realizing the highly accurate and precise positioning. First, we define the sparse-training data, i.e., the data collection time and the number of smartphones, directions, beacons, and reference points, on BLE positioning systems. Next, the positioning performance evaluation experiments are conducted in two indoor environments, that is, an indoor corridor as a one-dimensionally spread environment and a hall as a two-dimensionally spread environment. The algorithms for comparison are the conventional fingerprint algorithm and the hybrid algorithm (the authors already proposed, and combined the proximity algorithm and the fingerprint algorithm). Based on the results, we confirm that the hybrid algorithm performs well in many cases even when using sparse-training data. Consequently, the robustness of the hybrid algorithm, that the authors already proposed for the sparse-training data, is shown.

We track the position of a moving sensor by integrating highly unreliable and noisy BLE observations streaming from multiple locations. A novel aspect of our approach is the development of an observation model, specifically tailored for received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprints: a combination based on the optimal transport model of Wasserstein distance. The tracking results of the entire system are compared with alternative baseline estimation methods, such as nearest neighboring fingerprints and an artificial neural network. Our results show that highly accurate estimation from noisy Bluetooth data is practically feasible with an observation model based on Wasserstein distance interpolation combined with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method for tracking.

The installation of systems based on wireless networks can play a key role in the extension of the smart grid toward smart homes, that can be deemed as one of themost important components of smart grids. In fact, monitoring and control applications, energy harvesting, and innovative metering methodologies through smart wireless devices are becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel energy management approach for smart homes that combines a wireless network, based on bluetooth low energy (BLE), for communication among home appliances, with a home energy management (HEM) scheme. The proposed approach addresses the impact of standby appliances and high-power rating loads in peak hours to the energy consumption charges of consumers. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand and electricity consumption charges with an increase in the comfort level of consumers.

The user may express restrictions, such as who can access the resources, at which point in time and from which location. However, the location requirement is difficult to achieve in an indoor environment. Determining user locations inside of buildings is based on a variety of solutions. Moreover, current access control solutions do not consider restricting access to sensitive data in indoor environments. This article presents a graphical web interface based on OpenStreetMap (OSM), called Indoor Mapping Web Interface (IMWI), which is designed to use indoor maps and floor plans of several real-world objects, such as hospitals, universities and other premises. By placing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons inside buildings and by labeling them on digital indoor maps, the web interface back-end will provide the stored location data within an access control environment. Using the stored information will enable users to express indoor access control restrictions. Moreover, the IMWI enables and ensures the accurate determination of a user device location in indoor scenarios. By defining several scenarios the usability of the IMWI and the validity of the policies have been evaluated.	[Sharhan, Senan M.

Among other technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can be exploited for achieving an energy-efficient and low-cost solution. This work presents the design and implementation of an received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based indoor localization system. The paper shows the implementation of a low complex weighted k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that processes raw RSSI data from connection-less iBeacon's. The designed hardware and firmware are implemented around the low-power and low-cost nRF52832 from Nordic Semiconductor. Experimental evaluation with the real-time data processing has been evaluated and presented in a 7.2 m by 7.2 m room with furniture and 5 beacon nodes. The experimental results show an average error of only 0.72 m in realistic conditions. Finally, the overall power consumption of the fixed beacon with a periodic advertisement of 100 ms is only 50 mu A at 3 V, which leads to a long-lasting solution of over one year with a 500 mA h coin battery.

In this study, we adapt the fingerprint technique using Bluetooth Low Energy to locate the exact room of a person, seeking a simple and low-cost solution. The system is based on BLE beacons deployed at fixed positions and a person carrying a BLE scanner that generates fingerprints from the BLE beacons in coverage. We formulate it as a classification problem where each room is a class; the objective is to estimate the exact room, trying to maximize the area and number of rooms, but also trying to minimize the number of BLE beacons. The room estimation engine is based on a kNN (k-nearest neighbors) classifier. We evaluate the accuracy in two real scenarios and empirically measure the room estimation success related to the number of BLE beacons. As a proof-of-concept, a laptop and a Raspberry Pi are used as BLE scanners to test different hardware. We follow a measurement campaign for several days at different times to evaluate the stability and repeatability of the system. With just a few beacons an accuracy between 70 and 90% is achieved for house and university scenarios.

The growth of smartphone usage nowadays has fostered a new and popular mobile payment environment. Most of the current generation smartphones support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to communicate with nearby BLE-enabled devices. It is plausible to construct an Over-the-Air BLE-based mobile payment system as one of the payment methods for people living in modern societies. In this paper, a secure indoor positioning-based mobile payment authentication protocol with BLE technology and the corresponding mobile payment system design are proposed. The proposed protocol consists of three phases: initialization phase, session key construction phase, and authentication phase. When a customer moves toward the POS counter area, the proposed mobile payment system will automatically detect the position of the customer to confirm whether the customer is ready for the checkout process. Once the system has identified the customer is standing within the payment-enabled area, the payment system will invoke authentication process between POS and the customer's smartphone through BLE communication channel to generate a secure session key and establish an authenticated communication session to perform the payment transaction accordingly. A prototype is implemented to assess the performance of the proposed design for mobile payment system.

In this paper we present a novel open-source sniffer that can monitor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) traffic on all channels in real time. The sniffer builds on a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) framework to capture the entire BLE spectrum and exploits Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) capabilities to channelize and process BLE traffic in real time. We show that our sniffer can easily and reliably detect active BLE connections, and infer their properties, including Access Address, CRC values and hopping sequences. From a general standpoint, we show that tracking many BLE data sessions at the same time becomes feasible even with relatively inexpensive equipment, as we are able to discover up to 24 simultaneous sessions within 80 ms on average.

In BLE networks, discovery process enables fast and energy-efficient communication, since all communications must involve it at the first step. For this reason, some studies have proposed novel discovery schemes to improve the performance of device discovery process. Nevertheless, literature report that provides a consolidated view are limited and insufficient. In this paper, we survey different device discovery schemes in BLE networks and discuss their advantages and limitations. The enhanced schemes are categorized into two approaches: parameter adjustment and collision avoidance approach. The first approach improves the performance by adjusting the discovery parameters according to a network situation. In the second approach, the BLE devices try to avoid the interference to reduce collisions in crowded networks.

To be cost effective, IWSNs are also expected to be low cost and low power. In this context, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a promising technology, as it allows implementing low-cost industrial networks. As BLE is a short-range technology, a multihop mesh network is needed to cover a large area. Nevertheless, the recently published Bluetooth mesh networking specifications do not provide support for real-time communications over multihop mesh networks. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the multihop real-time BLE (MRT-BLE) protocol, a real-time protocol developed on top of BLE, that allows for bounded packet delays over mesh networks. MRT-BLE also provides priority support. This paper describes in detail the MRT-BLE protocol and how to implement it on commercial-off-the-shelf devices. Two kinds of performance evaluation for the MRT-BLE protocol are provided. The first one is a worst case end-to-end delay analysis, while the second one is based on the experimental results obtained through measurements on a real testbed.

The ultra-dense nature of IIoT applications implies that BLE networks are associated with a high probability of packet collisions, increasing the data collection latency. Determining the optimal packet transmission interval that minimizes the data collection latency is very challenging due to the non-linearity of this problem. We derive an analytic solution by which to realize an optimal advertising interval in a closed-form expression and prove its optimality and uniqueness. Based on a simple closed-form solution, we develop a low-complexity self-optimizing algorithm that minimizes the data collection latency. Simulation results confirm that the analytic results are accurate and that the proposed algorithm autonomously optimizes BLE networks.

Information technology needed by the public that is looking for information position and location of destination in the building (indoor positionting). Indoor positioning using WiFi has limits on location placement. To overcome these shortcomings are used sensor beacon bluetooth low energy with the advantages of having low power consumption and relatively small dimensions that can be placed in various places that are difficult to reach by WiFi. Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is a system for knowing the position of objects or people in a room by using radio waves, magnetic fields, or other sensors obtained by mobile devices. The indoor positioning method is divided into deterministic and probabilistic. Deterministic can determine the position faster by using measurement techniques such as Trilateration and Triangulation. Trilateration is a method for determining location with known three location information and device distance to each access point. This research used Trilateration method with measurement technique based on RSSI value. Based on the results of the test, RSSI of the beacon is strongly affected by objects that have thickness and density. In line of sight conditions, Android devices are able to receive signals properly and determine the location of the device using trilateration with quite accurate.

All communications in BLE networks must involve neighbor discovery process (NDP) in the first place since a BLE device needs to create a connection or exchange information with its neighbors. Thus, the performance of the discovery latency is a challenging issue to be addressed for integrating BLE into the Beacon application development as the number of BLE devices increases. In this paper, we propose a twoway communication with wait-slot scheme (TCWS) to minimize the probability of collision occurring on the response frames of BLE devices and improve the latency of NDP. We formulate the state transition diagram for analyzing the performance of our proposed scheme. The results show that TCWS provides much better performance in terms of the probability of collision and the discovery latency in dense BLE networks.

Securing this technology and its networking capabilities is paramount, as their widespread use by Internet of Things (IoT) applications demands protection from malicious users. While its security features have remarkably improved over the years, the BLE technology is still prone to severe threats, creating a gap between the standard theoretical design and its implementation. Particularly, the BLE Mesh Profile (Bluetooth Mesh), which enables many-to-many communication, prompts an overall analysis of its security, to ensure that its use preserves the integrity and privacy of end users. This work surveys the state-of-the-art of the security of BLE with an emphasis on Bluetooth Mesh, highlighting the threats that can still hinder their usage. We review the latest specifications in terms of link set up and authentication and describe attacks to both point-to-point and multicast networking. Our work also discusses solutions to mitigate and prevent attacks to the current standard, such as Intrusion Detection Systems, thus improving the general level of security of BLE systems.

Many potential BLE applications are delay-sensitive which demand a fast data delivery. However, since BLE coexist with other technologies such as WiFi, ZigBee, microwave, the BLE may experience severe interference. The interference can cause the BLE connection event to be unexpectedly closed which forces the device to enter sleep mode even though there is more data to be sent. This negatively affects the performance of the BLE in terms of transmission delay which makes the BLE not suitable for delay-sensitive applications. To address this issue, we propose an extension of channel access scheme of the BLE in connection state. The proposed scheme is based on the listen-before-talk mechanism where the device should sense the channel before using it. By using Markov analysis, several performance measures are derived.

General-Purpose Processor (GPP) based SDRs have generally been too slow for low-latency protocols. Meanwhile Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based SDR setups suffer from high prices and a steep learning curve for developers. This paper investigates the feasibility of implementing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in a GPP based Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) connected SDR. In particular, we focus on adhering to the timing requirements of BLE in a practical SDR implementation. For this, we propose a multi-threaded implementation based on a subset of the open-source BLE library BTLE. Using a signal generator and oscilloscope, we show that the SDR is able to achieve a response time down to 105 mu s and can accurately respond in the required 150 +/- 2 mu s Inter Frame Space (IFS) time window. Furthermore, we also validate that channel hopping is supported by the SDR-based platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SDR implementation able to meet the IFS requirements of BLE, hereby leading the way for more complete fully software based BLE protocol stacks.

The applications of BLE are growing rapidly and there are many issues to be resolved for establishing the deployment of it. Practically, BLE devices may experience a lot of collisions during discovery process due to contention among devices, particularly in a crowded environment. With an increasing number of BLE devices, discovery latency and energy consumption rise exponentially, which could degrade the quality of service required by user applications. In this study, the authors propose an enhanced discovery mechanism by employing a backoff strategy for BLE devices to reduce collisions during advertisement process. Through experimental and mathematical analysis, the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness in terms of discovery latency and energy consumption in crowded BLE networks.

For over a decade, the demand for a new low power wireless standard has been growing worldwide for various commercial applications, such as home and building automation, health, sports and fitness, medical, sensor networking, and even the automotive field. Electronic wireless sensors are connected to smart devices of patients using wireless connectivity systems, such as Bluetooth which is classified into two main technologies: classic-Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE is an emerging low-power wireless technology that is expected to be used to communicate with electronic wireless sensors in the medical field. Devices using BLE wireless technology are expected to consume a fraction of the power of classic-Bluetooth enabled products for Bluetooth communication. In many cases, products will be able to operate for more than a year on a coin cell battery without recharging. That will allow sensors such as thermometers to operate continuously, communicating intermittently with other devices such as smart devices. This may increase the concerns for privacy, because remote, low-power, continuously on sensors would be present in devices with BLE. This paper reports the results of a transmission experiment with stream data using BLE, although BLE is inefficient for transferring large quantities of data. The goal of this paper is to introduce BLE wireless technology and to report results obtained when medical stream data was transmitted using BLE.

J	Alabduljabbar, R				Alabduljabbar, Reham			An IoT-Aware System for Managing Patients' Waiting Time Using Bluetooth Low-Energy Technology	COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Internet of things (IoT); location-aware; Bluetooth low energy; beacon	OUTPATIENT	It is a common observation that whenever patients arrives at the front desk of a hospital, outpatient clinic, or other health-associated centers, they have to first queue up in a line and wait to fill in their registration form to get admitted. The long waiting time without any status updates is the most common complaint, concerning health officials. In this paper, UrNext, a location-aware mobile-based solution using Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) technology is presented to solve the problem. Recently, a technology-oriented method, the Internet of Things (IoT), has been gaining popularity in helping to solve some of the healthcare sector's problems. The implementation of this solution could be illustrated through a simple example of when a patient arrives at a clinic for a consultation. Instead of having to wait in long lines, that patient will be greeted automatically, receive a push notification of an admittance along with an estimated waiting time for a consultation session. This will not only provide the patients with a sense of freedom but would also reduce the uncertainty levels that are generally observed, thus saving both time and money. This work aims to improve the clinics' quality of services, organize queues and minimize waiting times, leading to patients' comfort while reducing the burden on nurses and receptionists. The results demonstrate that the presented system is successful in its performance and helps achieves a pleasant and conducive clinic visitation process with higher productivity.

The data on these devices is often related to user health or used to control safety-critical functionality, which makes it vital to protect the data from unauthorised access or manipulations. The only mechanism that is fully defined within the BLE specification for protecting sensitive data is pairing. This occurs at the device-level rather than at the application-level, and leaves BLE data vulnerable to unauthorised access at higher layers. When a BLE device interacts with a multi-application platform (i.e., a device that hosts more than one application, such as a mobile phone), when one application is able to access data from the BLE peer, all other applications on the same multi-application platform are also implicitly allowed the same access. The solutions suggested thus far for this vulnerability are either impractical for most users, not backward compatible with billions of existing devices, or do not suit normal BLE usage scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis considering practical aspects regarding the BLE ecosystem, and thereafter propose a solution that will extend the available protection for BLE data to the application layer. Our solution ensures protection by default for BLE data, and is entirely backward compatible with existing BLE implementations, requiring no modification to resource-constrained BLE peripherals or companion applications. We also present an open-source proofo-f-concept implemented on the Android-x86 platform. This, when tested against experimental and real-world devices and applications, demonstrates the viability and efficacy of our proposed solution.

Moreover, the technologists are doing research to make WMN more reliable and secure. Subsequently, among wireless ad-hoc networking technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is gaining high degree of importance among researchers due to its easy availability in the gadgets and low power consumption. BLE started its journey from version 4.0 and announced the latest version 5 with mesh support capability. BLE being a low power and mesh supported technology is nowadays among the hot research topics for the researchers. Many of the researchers are working on BLE mesh technology to make it more efficient and smart. Apart from other variables of efficiency, like all communication networks, mesh network security is also of a great concern. In view of the aforesaid, this paper provides a comprehensive review on several works associated to the security in WMN and BLE mesh networks and the research related to the BLE security protocols. Moreover, after the detailed research on related works, this paper has discussed the pros and cons of the present developed mesh security mechanisms. Also, at the end after extracting the curx from the present research on WMN and BLE mesh security, this research study has devised some solutions as how to mitigate the BLE mesh network security lapses.

The proposed sensing system is composed of multiple sensors that are installed in different locations in a home environment. The specific location of the user in the building has been pre-recorded into the proposed sensing system that captures the raw Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from the BLE beacon that is attached on the user. Two methods are proposed to determine the indoor location and the tracking of the users: a trilateration-based method and fingerprinting-based method. Experiments have been carried out in different home environments to verify the proposed system and methods. The results show that our system is able to accurately track the user location in home environments and can track the living patterns of the user which, in turn, may be used to infer the health status of the user. Our results also show that the positions of the BLE beacons on the user and different quality of BLE beacons do not affect the tracking accuracy.

Beacon, a small wireless transmitter, can send signals to other devices nearby. As Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a low-cost wireless technology, it has emerged to dominate a beacon technology market. BLE advertising is a critical part of the protocol that can broadcast messages to the nearby scanners. In BLE 5.0, the protocol even improves advertising capabilities significantly. The new extended advertising packets are designed for expanding the possibilities of sending more data. When the beacon needs to broadcast more data through advertisements, the packets of different advertising services that need to be transmitted on specific channels should be considered for better transmission efficiency. However, the channel selection algorithms in BLE 5.0 are insufficient: to support the transmission of diverse extended advertisements. In this paper, we give a clear classification of advertising services for BLE 5.0, propose a simple scheme to improve the channel utilization and show an analytical model to study the blocking probability of the BLE advertising network. In addition, we use this analytical model to identify the blocking performance of the network. Simulation results validated by analytical model show that the proposed scheme improves the transmission efficiency of extended advertising events in BLE 5.0 networks.

It can detect 3-lead ECG signals and is completely wireless. Secondly the digital Compressed Sensing (CS) is implemented to increase the energy efficiency of wireless ECG sensor. Different sparsifying basis, various compression ratio (CR) and several reconstruction algorithms are simulated and discussed. Finally the reconstruction is done by the android application (App) on smartphone to display the signal in real time. The power efficiency is measured and compared with the system without CS. The optimum satisfying basis built by 3-level decomposed db4 wavelet coefficients, 1-bit Bernoulli random matrix and the most suitable reconstruction algorithm are selected by the simulations and applied on the sensor node and App. The signal is successfully reconstructed and displayed on the App of smartphone. Battery life of sensor node is extended from 55 h to 67 h. The presented wireless ECG system with CS can significantly extend the battery life by 22 %. With the compact characteristic and long term working time, the system provides a feasible solution for the long term homecare utilization.

The radio part occupies 2.9 mm(2) while the complete SoC occupies 5.9 mm(2). The transceiver consumes 11 mW when receiving at -94 dBm and 10 mW when transmitting at 0 dBm. This is roughly a factor 2 lower than benchmark mass-produced designs. The power consumption is higher than recently published experimental sliding-IF designs, but it does not suffer from their inherent susceptibility to blocking and pulling. Easy application is enabled by a fully integrated single-ended 50 Omega RFIO and combined Buck-and Boost-mode DC-DC converter.

Low power consumption and maximum data privacy are two parameters that make these setups deployable. With the Bluetooth protocol being enabled with smarter processing and lower energy consumption to create the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) segment of peripherals, the focus of this research is to investigate keyless entry systems using this technology. The system has been prototyped using the Programmable System on Chip (PSoC-4 BLE) from Cypress Semiconductors with a BLE peripheral as the host and the user smartphone as the client. The user will advertise through the smartphone BLE and a predefined whitelist at the client end decides which host is granted access. Development was concentrated on taking maximum advantage of the power saving modes available in BLE. There were a considerable number of design issues and tradeoffs that needed to be considered were and looked into. Design issues and tradeoffs between parameters such as optimal scan duty cycle, scan range, power consumption and minimum authentication time have been discussed with implementation results.

As part of the service discovery mechanism of BLE, devices announce themselves by broadcasting radio signals called advertisement packets that can be collected with off-the-shelf hardware and software. To avoid the risk of tracking based on those messages, BLE features an address randomization mechanism that substitutes the device MAC address with random temporary pseudonyms. However, the payload of the advertisement packet still contains fields that can hamper the randomization mechanism by exposing counters and static identifiers. In addition to defeating the randomization mechanism, some of these fields can leak sensitive attributes of the owner such as his medical condition. As a consequence, we implemented Himiko to raise awareness about the privacy issues that the BLE advertising mechanism can involve. This tool aims to show the information that a passive eavesdropper can infer by leveraging the contents of BLE advertisement packets. The advertising raw data are collected and processed from devices that have their Bluetooth interface enabled. The user is then shown the information that are leaking from his device.

J	Lin, YW; Lin, CY				Lin, You-Wei; Lin, Chi-Yi			An Interactive Real-Time Locating System Based on Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacon Network	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; location-based service; mesh network; internet of things		The ubiquity of Bluetooth-enabled smartphones and peripherals has brought tremendous convenience to our daily life. In recent years, Bluetooth beacons have also been gaining popularity in implementing a variety of innovative location-based services such as self-guided systems in exhibition centers. However, the broadcast-based beacon technology can only provide unidirectional communication. In case smartphone users would like to respond to the beacon messages, they have to rely on their own mobile Internet connections to send the information back to the backend system. Nevertheless, mobile Internet services may not be always available or too costly. In this work, we develop a real-time locating system based only on the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology to support interactive communications by combining the broadcast and mesh topology options to extend the applicability of beacon solutions. Specifically, we turn the smartphone into a beacon device and augment the beacon devices with the capability of forming a mesh network. The implementation result shows that our beacon devices can detect the presence of specific users at specific locations, and then the presence state can be sent to the application server via the relay of beacon devices. Moreover, the application server can send personalized location-based messages to the users, again via the relay of beacon devices. With the capability of relaying messages between the beacon devices, it would be convenient for developers to implement a variety of interactive applications such as tracking VIP customers at the airport, or tracking an elder with Alzheimer's disease in the neighborhood.

J	Szyc, K; Nikodem, M; Zdunek, M				Szyc, Kamil; Nikodem, Maciej; Zdunek, Michal			Bluetooth low energy indoor localization for large industrial areas and limited infrastructure	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Localization; Received signal strength indicator; Range-free localization	DAIRY-COWS; TEMPERATURE; RSSI	Systems using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication are widely used in various industrial applications, which benefit from the efficient low-power operation and pervasive availability of BLE transceivers in a large number of devices and sensors. It is no different in Smart Factory and Smart Farming settings, where BLE systems are already used for asset monitoring, management, tracking, and localization. The existing BLE-based localization systems aim at high accuracy and precision using radio propagation models and multilateration, or radio fingerprinting. Both methods use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements and the dependency of RSSI on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Because RSSI measurements are highly inaccurate and susceptible to radio propagation phenomena, high localization accuracy is only possible if the anchor devices are densely deployed, and the propagation conditions are stable. Unfortunately, these requirements do not hold in industrial systems where radio propagation is complex, the number of anchors is limited, and propagation conditions change because the environment is dynamic. Therefore, localization methods for industrial applications have to balance system complexity (e.g., anchor density, energy cost) and localization accuracy so that practical benefits can be attained. This paper presents a set of localization algorithms that require limited infrastructure, have low complexity, and can provide valuable location information at low costs. The proposed algorithms were verified in a real-life Smart Farming application where BLE is used to monitor well-being of farm animals. The animal localization was integrated with the already existing system and proved to operate reliably despite system-level constraints and varying propagation conditions - interference, signal attenuation, and unavailability of raw radio signal measurements. The proposed approaches allow localizing animals in the cowshed of 1600 m2, using only 10 anchors with an average positioning error below 8 m. The algorithms are based on signal strength measurement, so they can be applied to other radio technologies.

The installation of systems based on wireless networks can play a key role also in the extension of the smart grid towards smart homes, that can be deemed as one of the most important components of smart grids. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based solution for smart energy management in a home automation wireless network. The approach, by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), introduces a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) in order to improve a Home Energy Management (HEM) scheme, addressing the power load of standby appliances and their loads in different hours of the day. Since the consumer is involved in the choice of switching on/off of home appliances, the approach introduced in this work proposes a fuzzy-based solution in order to manage the consumer feedbacks. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand, electricity consumption charges with an increase comfort level of consumers. The performance of the proposed BLE-based wireless network scenario are validated in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter and are compared to IEEE 802.15.4 technology.

One popular IoT scenario features a smart home service gateway, which becomes the central point of user's home environment facilitating a multitude of tasks. Given that most IoT devices connected to residential gateway are small-scale and battery-powered, the key challenge is to extend their lifetime without recharging/replacing batteries. To this end, a novel radio technology named Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has recently been completed to enable energy-efficient data transfer. Another inspiring innovation is the capability of sensors to harvest wireless energy in their local environment. In this work, we envision a scenario where many in-home sensors are communicating with a smart gateway over the BLE protocol, while at the same time harvesting RF energy transmitted from the gateway wirelessly via a dedicated radio interface. We thoroughly investigate performance limitations of such wireless energy transfer interface (WETI) with dynamic analytical model and with important practical considerations. Our methodology delivers the upper bound on WETI operation coupled with BLE-based communication, which characterizes ultimate system performance over the class of practical radio and energy resource management algorithms.

Nowadays, robustness is considered a key requirement in wireless communication. However, radio interference from various sources may affect the performance of BLE devices, leading to channel congestion. Therefore, there is a broadly recognized need of methodologies capable of sensing and avoiding interference. In this paper, two improvements at the data link layer for interference detection and channel selection are proposed to enhance the BLE connection robustness. This paper also presents a wide range of experimental evaluations aiming at validating the improvements and providing insights on both these improvements. Particularly, the communication performance of the BLE link layer is assessed in terms of channel usage distribution, supervision timeout ratio (STR) and packet loss rate (PLR) under different interference environments. Results from these experiments (reliability over 97% and 99% under two different harsh environments) highlight the effects of both improvements on the BLE robustness. Meanwhile, the authority of scheduling the whole mechanism is given to the link layer and even the higher application layer. This paper provides a set of solutions for BLE confronting interference in link layer.

However, there are several issues including Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO), multipath effect, Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), noise, and phase shifting faced by the AoA. To tackle these issues, we first highlight the wireless signal model in BLE standard and formulate the transmitted signal, wireless channel model, and the signal received by Linear Antenna Array (LAA). In addition, the paper introduces a novel fusion processing technique to eliminate the destructive impact of the wireless channel on the received signal, which leads to accurate angle detection following precise position estimation.

Every year, several deaths are caused by this phenomenon, even though a lot of money is invested in raising awareness and in the development of prevention systems. In this paper, a blind spot detection and warning system is proposed, relying on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless communication. The received RSSI samples are threshold-filtered, after which a weighted average is computed with a sliding window filter. The technique is validated by simulations and measurements. Finally, the strength of the proposed system is demonstrated with real-life measurements.

Compared to the previous version, Bluetooth specification 5 provides more options for data rate and transmission power and gives room for adaptive parameter control to improve BLE performance in time-varying wireless environments. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first systematic study of this regime in the research community. We experimentally study how more parameter options in Bluetooth specification 5 impact BLE performance. Based on the preliminary study, we design AdaptaBLE that dynamically adjusts connection interval, data rate, and transmission power together to satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements without wasting energy. Through extensive performance evaluation on off-the-shelf BLE chips, we show that AdaptaBLE provides stable performance regardless of wireless environments and reduces QoS failures by 5 times with similar energy consumption compared to the state-of-the-art parameter control scheme for BLE.

The microdevice is partitioned into two miniaturized head-mounted and backpack units with compact enclosures. The head-mounted unit houses a previously developed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for ADS along with all the requisite peripheral hardware. The backpack unit houses power-management electronics and a BLE module for bidirectional wireless communication between the head-mounted unit and a BLE-enabled user base station. The overall microdevice weighs similar to 48g and consumes similar to 618.W from a lithium-ion battery (3.6V, 1.6Ah) placed in the backpack unit. Moreover, the overall functionality of the microdevice is experimentally demonstrated in vitro in saline via recording and discriminating neural spike waveforms as well as performing spike-triggered stimulation. The microdevice is envisioned for use in longitudinal experiments assessing the effects of ADS on facilitating functional recovery in an NHP model of tramu atic brain injury.

Simplest way to communicate with these protocols over the internet is to use a Gateway. This paper proposes a design of gateway to communicate with both protocols using a single gateway. This design reduces the cost of using separate gateways for individual protocol. The BLE radio module is embedded on the gateway for all Bluetooth enabled sensors. Two radio modules of ZigBee are embedded at the gateway, one for data collected at intervals and another for streaming data. Scheduling is done with the help of a Linux kernel. This design furnishes advantages of both the protocols and also increases the data transmission rate of ZigBee with reduced latency. SSL and DTLS connections are used for added security.

They need to be attentive and aware of the provided interaction mechanisms in order to initiate a desired process. Yet, interaction may also have an implicit nature when people do not perceive that they are controlling a system but continue their natural behavior. Exemplarily, Be-In/Be-Out (BIBO) ticketing services in public transportation systems utilize implicit interaction and enable passengers to obtain their (virtual) tickets just by "being" inside a vehicle. Infrastructural appliances detect their presence and initiate services unnoticed in the background. In this paper we focus on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as enabling technology for the implementation of BIBO systems, evidence its applicability for the domain of public transportation systems and confine our concepts to related Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) implementations.

Continuous Non-Invasive Assessment of Gait Speed Through Bluetooth Low Energy	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Sensors; Biomedical monitoring; Particle measurements; Monitoring; Atmospheric measurements; Wearable computers; Legged locomotion; Ambient assisted living; bluetooth low energy; gait speed	MEANINGFUL CHANGE; OLDER-ADULTS; DISABILITY; SURVIVAL; PREDICTS; HEALTH; WELL	In the near future, as a consequence of the increasing percentage of elder people with respect to the total population, developed countries will face significant stress on their healthcare systems. The onset of some diseases associated with aging, such as dementia or cognitive decline, has been associated with a number of factors that can be detected in advance, thus offering the possibility of an early intervention to delay their onset. Specifically, several studies have shown a correlation between slower gait speed and serious cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this work we present a method, based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), capable of detecting the user's walking speed in a continuous and non-invasive way, providing a useful tool for the monitoring and early detection of this type of diseases. The proposed method estimates the gait speed with an average error of less than 10 cm/s, and is capable of providing continuous non-invasive monitoring of the gait speed of users while they conduct their usual life routines, without any additional requirements other than wearing a smartwatch or an activity band with inertial sensors and BLE capabilities.

J	Lin, CY; Liao, KH; Chang, CH				Lin, Chi-Yi; Liao, Kai-Hung; Chang, Chia-Hsuan			An Experimental System for MQTT/CoAP-based IoT Applications in IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Internet of Things; Bluetooth Low Energy; 6LoWPAN; MQTT; CoAP		With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), it is an inevitable trend that all things will get connected to the Internet to form various intelligent services such as Industry 4.0, smart home, smart medical care, etc. To make such intelligent IoT services practicable, it is vital to have a low-power link-layer technology that can accommodate a diversity of upperlayer networking protocols. Currently, there are many popular low-power wireless networking technologies for IoT such as ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Because of the ubiquity of BLE-enabled smartphones nowadays, BLE has gained much attention in the IoT industry recently. In this research, we aim at implementing an IPv6 over BLE experimental system using Raspberry Pi 3 and nRF51-DK development boards, and then run the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport for Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over the protocol stack of IPv6/BLE. Specifically, in our experimental system every BLE node is IPv6-addressable and accessible through the MQTT/CoAP protocols from anywhere over the Internet. Moreover, to ease user accesses from ordinary web browsers, we build two gateways as the web servers for end users, which receive real-time sensor data via CoAP or MQTT-SN protocols and then push the data to end users' browsers. The gateways are also designed to routinely request sensor data and then forward the data to cloud database platforms, which serve as the data sources for historical sensor data. Preliminary results showed that our system is capable of achieving the designed goals and is user-friendly. Compared with the non-IP based BLE sensor networks, our implementation can be integrated into a variety of existing and widely used IP-based applications easily.

The receivers scan the BLE advertising channels for modulated advertising channel patterns by hopping the local oscillator (LO) frequency. The BC message is modulated in the sequence of the three advertising channels in each advertising event. This makes the wake-up via BC messaging compatible with the BLE standard, so it can be generated by a commercial offthe- shelf device. The first proposed receiver uses a dual mixer to downconvert the RF input to reduce the ring-based LO power consumption by operating it at half the RF frequency. The second prototype aims to achieve faster channel hopping using a more stable and lower noise LC-based oscillator. The receivers have -57.5-dBm/-82.2-dBm sensitivity while consuming 150 mu W/1.2 mW.

BLE has many advantages over classical Bluetooth technologies, including low-cost deployment and low-power consumption. Recently, a very few number of research studies have been conducted to improve device discovery process of BLE. But, these studies have still some limitations. Prior studies have assumed that advertising PDUs are immediately processed as long as they are received successfully by a scanner. Practically, however, BLE devices may experience lots of collisions due to contention among neighbors, particularly in a crowded environment. With increasing number of BLE devices, delays of both device discovery and connection setup keep exponential growth, which could influence user experience in terms of either time or energy consumption. In this paper, an enhanced mechanism is proposed to enable BLE advertisers and scanners to learn the network contention and adjust their parameters accordingly, so as to achieve fast discovery latency. Through extensive simulations, the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness to reduce unexpected long latency in crowded BLE networks.

J	Kolakowski, M				Kolakowski, Marcin			Improving Accuracy and Reliability of Bluetooth Low-Energy-Based Localization Systems Using Proximity Sensors	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						localization; hybrid localization; Bluetooth Low Energy; extended kalman filter; internet of things; proximity sensors	INDOOR LOCALIZATION	One of the functionalities which are desired in Ambient and Assisted Living systems is accurate user localization at their living place. One of the best-suited solutions for this purpose from the cost and energy efficiency points of view are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based localization systems. Unfortunately, their localization accuracy is typically around several meters and might not be sufficient for detection of abnormal situations in elderly persons behavior. In this paper, a concept of a hybrid positioning system combining typical BLE-based infrastructure and proximity sensors is presented. The proximity sensors act a supporting role by additionally covering vital places, where higher localization accuracy is needed. The results from both parts are fused using two types of hybrid algorithms. The paper contains results of simulation and experimental studies. During the experiment, an exemplary proximity sensor VL53L1X has been tested and its basic properties modeled for use in the proposed algorithms. The results of the study have shown that employing proximity sensors can significantly improve localization accuracy in places of interest.

Struck-by object or equipment is one of the main causes of fatal accidents on construction sites. Although many regulations have been designed for preventing struck-by accidents, they still happen and lead to many injuries and fatalities. The application of real-time location systems (RTLS) on construction sites provides new possibilities in construction safety management. Previous researchers have proposed using RTLS to track the locations of workers and equipment on construction sites to improve construction safety. However, they have the limitation of cabling problems. Also, providing effective safety alerts to workers within dangerous proximity to equipment has not been well addressed. This paper aims to develop a method for detecting the proximities as well as providing proximity safety alerts to workers on construction sites using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RTLS. Here, vibro-tactile alerts representing different cases of proximities were defined. Unnecessary alerts were filtered out to avoid desensitizing workers. A number of tests were conducted on a construction site to test the prototype system developed based on the proposed method. The results indicate that the system is capable of detecting proximities and generating timely vibro-tactile alerts, which can be easily perceived by the workers.

We have developed a method to sense and forecast street-level crowd density by observing public Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements from popular contact tracing applications in Japan. We have deployed our methods in several locations in Tokyo and published the estimated street-level crowd density level on our website as well as a television program. In this paper, we report the status of our project, focusing on the result of experiments to verify the potential of our method after the contact tracing applications stop working. Through an experiment in an urban public space in Tokyo, we have shown that BLE advertisements are almost occupied with contact tracing applications and manufacture specific data from a few companies. In addition, by monitoring different types of BLE advertisements in several locations in Japan, we have clarified that those containing manufacture specific data with a certain company identifier have almost the same trend as those from contact tracing applications, with the average correlation coefficient of 0.990.

These systems, however, are not usable indoors, because there is no signal from satellites. Therefore, it is necessary to use other localization techniques indoors. This paper focuses on the use of Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi radio technologies. We have created a special mobile application for the Android operating system in order to evaluate these techniques. This application allows localization testing in a real environment within a building of a university campus. We compare multiple approaches based on K-Nearest Neighbors and Particle Filter algorithms that have been further modified. The combination of Low Energy Bluetooth and Wi-Fi appears to be a promising solution reaching the satisfying accuracy and minimal deployment costs.

Since the convolutional coded Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK) signal is specified in the BLE 5.0 standard, two Viterbi processors are needed for detection and decoding. However, the proposed JVDD scheme uses only one Viterbi processor by modifying the branch metric with inter-symbol interference information from GMSK modulation; therefore, the hardware complexity can be significantly reduced without performance degradation.

There has been sufficient motivation on statistical analysis of Channel State Information of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data for more effective rangingbased models. However, there has been no ubiquitous solution which is both receiver-agnostic and does not require alteration in the advertisement protocol or packet structure of BLE. In this paper, we propose a truly unsupervised approach for channel-annotation of RSSI data received by a stationary receiver object. Given a sequence of RSSI observations and a discoverable receiver channel-switching policy, we determine the period and hence the time spent by the receiver in an individual channel. Then, we propose a sliding-window based algorithm which utilizes two well-established Likelihood-Ratio algorithms -KLIEP and uLSIF -for extracting Channel State Information of retrospective RSSI observation data. We believe this work lays the foundation of motivating future work in completely unsupervised methods for object-to-object ranging and localization.

Not only on the streets but also in places such as educational institutions, hospitals, commercial activities, special events, and entertainment uses. Finding a free parking lot in these places has evolved difficulty for the drivers. To solve such a problem, governments and researchers tried to find alternative solutions to overcome or mitigate the traffic congestion. Many solutions have been proposed, such as increasing the parking capacities, which takes much time or makes it hard to find a square area in crowded places. Most existing studies, do not consider the cost of deployment, energy, and time-tomarket consideration which makes the available systems need further investigation. In this paper, we propose an intelligent parking system prototype that can be useful for the drivers to have a prior knowledge about the available parking lots in the area of interest. Our proposed system involves deploying mmWave Radar sensor nodes in each parking lot to detect the availability of parking vehicle through transmitting radio pulses periodically. The detected information can be sent to the gateway through multi-hop for further statistics and reports. We also give an intensive analysis and study about the challenges and consideration on the mmWave radar design aiming to improve the detection accuracy and avoid falsedetection that occurs from objects near to the sensor. To ensure continuous operation and extend sensor life-time, we propose Bluetooth Low Energy BLE-enabled relay-feature as the communication protocol between the nodes.

However, regarding huge indoor place, there can be significant calculation problem issue due to a lot of cells to be pre-surveyed radio map and the great number of location anchor point such as beacon device. Furthermore, this can aggregate life time of user handheld devices which would be generally tiny shape and insufficient energy resource. In this paper, we present a new scheme which was researched with a unique goal for improving calculational computing power, with hibridizing traditional trilateration and recently issued fingerprinting approaches under the Bluetooth low energy environment.

An All-Digital 1 Mbps, 57 pJ/bit Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Backscatter ASIC in 65 nm CMOS	2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RFID (IEEE RFID 2022)	IEEE International Conference on RFID		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on RFID (IEEE RFID)	MAY 17-19, 2022	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE		ASIC; backscatter communication; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); RFID		We present an all-digital application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that implements Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-compatible backscatter communication. The ASIC was fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and occupies an active area of 0.12 mm(2) while consuming a total of 205 mu W DC power from 0.48 V and 1 V supplies. Of the total power consumption, 56% (115 mu W) is consumed by the digital logic, 16% (33 mu W) by the on-chip clock oscillator, and 28% (57 mu W) by the RF switch used as a backscatter modulator. The ASIC broadcasts up to 1000 BLE advertising packets per second at a data rate of 1 Mbps, yielding a backscatter modulator efficiency of 57 pJ/bit. The device was validated in both cabled and wireless (over-the-air) measurement setups, demonstrating compatibility with unmodified smartphones as well as commercially available BLE chips, such as the Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822. With the wireless test setup used in this work, and assuming a +10 dBm carrier source, the ASIC has a theoretical maximum read range of 4.9 m using a smartphone as the receiver. Building from previous work in BLE backscatter communication using FPGA-based prototypes, this work provides an important quantitative demonstration of the size and power savings that can be achieved in a BLE-compatible backscatter ASIC.

Through the queue mechanism and buffer management method, the key information that has the greatest impact on the monitoring effect is sent first, and the feedback mechanism is used to adjust the sampling period of the node in conjunction with the abnormal degree of the monitoring parameter. Experimental results show that the system constructed in this article significantly shortens the transmission delay of key information, with an average packet loss rate of 1.09%. Compared with the traditional method, this method is more timely and effective in handling abnormal data. It effectively solves the short distance and low efficiency of Bluetooth "point-to-multipoint" communication in the case of high data concurrency, and improves the reliability and stability of communication. In turn, the losses caused by environmental mutations are reduced.

The advantage of this technology lies in its support by contemporary mobile devices, especially by smartphones and tablets. We have implemented a distributed system for collecting radio fingerprints by mobile devices with the Android operating system. This system enables volunteers to create radio-maps and update them continuously. New Bluetooth Low Energy transmitters (Apple uses its "iBeacon" brand name for these devices) have been installed on the floor of the building in addition to existing WiFi access points. The localization of stationary objects based on WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and their combination has been evaluated using the data measured during the experiment in the building. Several configurations of the transmitters' arrangement, several ways of combination of the data from both technologies, and other parameters influencing the accuracy of the stationary localization have been tested.

Consequently, several universities impose a minimum attendance percentage criterion for students to be allowed to attend examinations; therefore, recording student attendance is a vital task. Conventional methods for recording student attendance in the classroom, such as roll-call and sign-in, are an inefficient use of instruction time and only increase teachers' workloads. In this study, we propose a Bluetooth Low Energy-based student positioning framework for automatically recording student attendance in classrooms. The proposed architecture consists of two components, an indoor positioning framework within the classroom and student attendance registration. Experimental studies using our method show that the Received Signal Strength Indicator fingerprinting technique that is used in indoor scenarios can achieve satisfactory positioning accuracy, even in a classroom environment with typically high signal interference. We intentionally focused on designing a basic system with simple indoor devices based on ubiquitous Bluetooth technology and integrating an attendance system with computational techniques in order to minimize operational costs and complications. The proposed system is tested and demonstrated to be usable in a real classroom environment at Rangsit University, Thailand.	[Puckdeevongs, Apiruk; Tripathi, N.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a popular wireless protocol used in the IoT. Because of its low price and low energy consumption, BLE is applied in numerous fields. In this paper, we use BLE technology in an electronic shelf label system. In accordance with the 80/20 principle, most customers are interested in only a small percentage of a store's merchandise. If resources can be allocated to the most suitable places, then more benefits can be obtained. Therefore, we consider the popularity of all products and allocate more resources to the electronic shelf labels (ESLs) of the most popular products. According to the neighbor discovery process (NDP) delay model and the popularity of each product, a gradient-based method is employed to calculate the advertising intervals for the ESLs. Our method reduces the average delay under the condition that the total power consumed does not increase. Besides, we propose a power-saving method that adaptively adjusts the advertising intervals to reduce the power consumed by popular ESLs depending on the environment. We also propose the neighbor discovery process delay model, which considers the failure to transmit advertising packets. The capability of the proposed scheme is evaluated by a series of experiments, for which we have encouraging results.

In the fine-tuning step, Delta rule is used to update the coordinates of reference points based on the wireless environment represented in the training dataset. The combination of the coarse estimation and the proposed fine-tuning makes the coarse-to-fine algorithm. The algorithms used for coarse estimation are weighted sum andk-nearest neighbour, with three weight calculation algorithms that are compared in this experiment: Minkowski distance,k-means Gaussian mixture model, and autoencoder. Two subject rooms are used in order to measure the performance of the algorithms. The experiment showed that the fine-tuning algorithm improves the accuracy of the positioning throughout all combination of methods in both rooms, which shows its versatility. It reduces the mean positioning error by up to 11.3% and depends on what algorithm used in the weight calculation. Another benefit from the fine-tuning model is that it does not increase the complexity of the algorithm in the online phase. Overall, the best result is achieved by the combination of weighted sum andk-nearest neighbour with Minkowski distance weight calculation, together with the proposed fine-tuning. Its mean positioning error is 0.8740 m for Room 1 and 1.5385 for Room 2. The average computing time for a single online query is 0.4 ms for Room 1 and 0.7 ms for Room 2.

Although Global Positioning System (GPS) ensures efficient outdoor localization, generally speaking, indoor localization systems fail to provide the same level of efficiency. In this regard, there has been recent widespread attention to Angle of Arrival (AoA) with the application on Switch Antenna Array (SAA), as an efficient indoor localization method due to its potential in determining location with low estimation error. The AoA, however, suffers from several issues including being sensitive to multipath effects, noise, fluctuations of received signal, and frequency/phase shifts. To tackle these issues, the paper proposes a set of signal processing and information fusion methods by integration of Nonlinear Least Square (NLS) curve fitting, Kalman Filter (KF), and Gaussian Filter (GF) to boost the accuracy rate of estimated angle. The proposed fusion framework is evaluated based on a real Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) dataset and results illustrate significant potentials in terms of improving overall BLE-based achievable accuracy in angle detection.

These systems are used for asset management, workflow improvement as well as patient and staff tracking. For test runs we decided on a low-cost location tracking system based on proximity detection and the technology Bluetooth Low Energy. The system was developed for the use in OR environments which comes with specific requirements. The goal of this work is to evaluate if people with Bluetooth Low Energy tags are reliably tracked and detected. These tests were conducted in the first stages of a development phase to see, how the tracking system behaved in a controlled office environment. Problems such as the inactivity of the tag and random changes into other nearby rooms because of multipath effects arise and are discussed.

Effective management of warehousing processes is, therefore, crucial for achieving minimal costs, maximum efficiency, and overall customer satisfaction. Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) are the first steps towards organizing these processes; however, due to the human factor involved, information on products, vehicles and workers may be missing, corrupt, or misleading. In this paper, a cost-effective Indoor Positioning System (IPS) based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is presented for use in Intralogistics that works automatically, and therefore minimizes the possibility of acquiring incorrect data. The proposed IPS solution is intended to be used for supervising order-picker movements, movement of packages between workstations, and tracking other mobile devices in a manually operated warehouse. Only data that are accurate, reliable and represent the actual state of the system, are useful for detailed material flow analysis and optimization in Intralogistics. Using the developed solution, IPS technology is leveraged to enhance the manually operated warehouse operational efficiency in Intralogistics. Due to the hardware independence, the developed software solution can be used with virtually any BLE supported beacons and receivers. The results of IPS testing in laboratory/office settings show that up to 98% of passings are detected successfully with time delays between approach and detection of less than 0.5 s.

More than 50 billion smart devices will be able to communicate with each other and internet services over the increasing network capabilities of wireless sensor networks nodes on IoT applications in the next ten years. One of the leading production areas using IoT within wireless sensor networks is precision agricultural practices. In this study, a new sensor node design, which includes ambient light and temperature sensors employing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocol, is used as an IoT application. Subsequent to this, sensor node power consumption and management cost was investigated. The experimental results show that the developed sensor node lifetime is about 8 years and the total cost of nodes and gateway model is under $50 per year per 0.1 hectare.

In this context, this paper deals with a wireless sensors platform for humidity, temperature, and light detection that has the peculiarity to be self-powered and battery-free. The main advantage of the proposed solution is the elimination of maintenance interventions due to battery replacement. Therefore, the availability of install-and-forget sensors allows an easy diffusion for a capillary detection of plant health and growth parameters throughout the cultivated area. The device platform implements off-the-shelf components on a printed circuit board (PCB) with the size of 2 x 2 cm2 and the thickness of 0.45 cm. The sensor platform can harvest energy and supply the sensors with light intensity as low as 300 lux and communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy communication. Experimental measurements carried out in the rural context of the rows of a vineyard show the system functionality with a reliable communication distance, between the sensor platform and a remote Base Station, within a radius of 160 m.

J	Cha, SC; Yeh, KH; Chen, JF				Cha, Shi-Cho; Yeh, Kuo-Hui; Chen, Jyun-Fu			Toward a Robust Security Paradigm for Bluetooth Low Energy-Based Smart Objects in the Internet-of-Things	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; internet-of-things; privacy; random address; security	SYSTEM	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. In BLE-based IoT applications, e.g., wearables-oriented service applications, the Bluetooth MAC addresses of devices will be swapped for device pairings. The random address technique is adopted to prevent malicious users from tracking the victim's devices with stationary Bluetooth MAC addresses and accordingly the device privacy can be preserved. However, there exists a tradeoff between privacy and security in the random address technique. That is, when device pairing is launched and one device cannot actually identify another one with addresses, it provides an opportunity for malicious users to break the system security via impersonation attacks. Hence, using random addresses may lead to higher security risks. In this study, we point out the potential risk of using random address technique and then present critical security requirements for BLE-based IoT applications. To fulfill the claimed requirements, we present a privacy-aware mechanism, which is based on elliptic curve cryptography, for secure communication and access-control among BLE-based IoT objects. Moreover, to ensure the security of smartphone application associated with BLE-based IoT objects, we construct a Smart Contract-based Investigation Report Management framework (SCIRM) which enables smartphone application users to obtain security inspection reports of BLE-based applications of interest with smart contracts.

The system employed a dual precision op amp of TLC4502 as the preamplifier and a bluetooth low energy ( BLE) chip of CC2541 as the main controller, and the main controller integrated 14 bits analog to digital convertor ( ADC). The system used the BLE development application program ( App) to establish a Bluetooth connection with the CC2541 14 wireless real-time reading of sensing potentials. The monitoring system software was developed on the basis of a BLE-CC254X-1. 41 protocol stack by the embedded development software of IAR Embedded Workbench. To verify the reliability and accuracy of the system, a precision regulated power supply was used for analog potential acquisition test, and a pH composite electrode was used for monitoring the pH change. The test results showed that the system could be applied to real time measurement of potential signals for three times amplification with an accuracy of 0. 4 mV, and a consistent response to pH change was able to quickly output with a linear correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0. 9994. Furthermore, the concentration change of L-cysteine (L-cys) was monitored in real time by the BLE system with a self-made L-cys sensor, and the dynamic response change was consistent with that of commercial multimeter, indicating that the rapid transmission and real time monitoring of potentiometric signals could be well realized through the BLE wireless sensing system.

The ultimate purpose of this study was to compare the different indoor positioning techniques towards achieving efficient position determination of moving customers in the retail store. The innovation of this research lies in its context (the retail store) and the fact that this is not a laboratory, controlled experiment. Retail stores are challenging environments with multiple sources of noise (e.g., shoppers' moving) that impede indoor localization. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work concerning indoor localization of consumers in a real retail store. This study proposes an ensemble filter with lower absolute mean and root mean squared errors than the random forest. Moreover, the localization error is approximately 2 m, while for the random forest, it is 2.5 m. In retail environments, even a 0.5 m deviation is significant because consumers may be positioned in front of different store shelves and, thus, different product categories. The more accurate the consumer localization, the more accurate and rich insights on the customers' shopping behavior. Consequently, retailers can offer more effective customer location-based services (e.g., personalized offers) and, overall, better consumer localization can improve decision making in retailing.

For the sake of network manageability and to reduce the overall network workload, wireless nodes are organized in clusters, which typically encompass neighboring nodes that frequently exchange data with each other. However, different clusters also cooperate to realize distributed applications and this raises the need for enabling communications between multiple clusters spread over large areas in the plant. This paper presents LoRaBLE, a long-range communication protocol that leverages the Long Range (LoRa) technology to provide inter-cluster communications over Bluetooth Low Energy networks with bounded delays, so as to meet the time constraints of real-time industrial traffic flows. The paper presents the design of LoRaBLE and a proof-of-concept implementation on a lab testbed made up of commercial-off-the-shelf devices.

Even though proximity sensing information can be easily monitored with pervasive smartphones, it is almost impossible to remotely monitor this information in a harsh location where it is not easy to access the Internet. With our overlay mesh network, each node should decide to either forward the packet or continue with their own activity when receiving the packet forwarding request, so as to minimize the end-to-end packet delivery latency but maximize the utilization of underlying infrastructures. Reinforcement learning (RL) is employed to train each node to make the above decision. Despite extensive upfront training, there is a high possibility that each node might still encounter an unseen state owing to the network dynamics. However, our novel Q-learning is able to deal with above challenges by constructing a Q-table during online learning, and then use the Q-table as input data for offline training. The experimental results indicate the substantial performance gain of our proposed approach in comparison to the existing Q-learning methods.

The microsystem comprises a previously developed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for activity-dependent intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), and the BLE link is dedicated to remote programming of the ICMS ASIC as well as to remote monitoring of several parameters such as the average stimulus rate, electrode site impedance, or power supply level. A prototype system is developed that incorporates the ICMS ASIC, SAMB11 BLE module, and peripheral electronics for supply management and ASIC monitoring, as well as a BLE user interface custom developed in C#. The end-to-end functionality of the BLE-enabled wireless link is experimentally demonstrated in representative benchtop tests in which several ASIC parameters are successfully programmed from the UBS over a distance of > 3.5m.

To make the operation of RPL over BLE feasible, we design an adaptation layer between BLE and RPL, termed ALBER. Specifically, we develop three technical features in ALBER which enable BLE to be combined with RPL. First, it broadcasts RPL control messages through BLE using advertising channels with low energy consumption. Second, it updates RPL routing table considering connection management of BLE. Lastly, it estimates link quality based on round trip time of link layer ping packets to provide routing metric for RPL. We implement our ALBER on Linux kernel. This demo will present an operation example of RPL over BLE using ALBER in a small scale multi-hop topology, where each node comprises a Raspberry Pi platform and a BLE dongle.

A Classic Bluetooth communication network has been proposed and designed to establish an emergency mobile ad hoc network (hereinafter referred to as Classic Bluetooth MANETs). In Classic Bluetooth MANETs, a terminal can cause an excess of connection retries and connection conflicts. These problems can slow down the time it takes to establish connections. Therefore, time-consuming connection establishment causes the degradation of the operation rate in Bluetooth MANETs. In this paper, we propose a new fast connection establishment method by using both Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies. We have also implemented and evaluated our proposed method through real terminal experiments. As a result, we have confirmed that the connection latency of our proposed method is almost 75 percent lower than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs and the energy consumption of our proposed method is less than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs.

In particular, the traditional distance estimation derived from aggregate RSS and signal-attenuation models is generally unstable because of the complicated interference in indoor environments. To improve the adaptability and robustness of the BLE positioning system, we propose making full use of the three separate channels of BLE instead of their combination, which has generally been used before. In the first step, three signal-attenuation models are separately established for each BLE advertising channel in the offline phase, and a more stable distance in the online phase can be acquired by assembling measurements from all three channels with the distance decision strategy. Subsequently, a weighted trilateration method with uncertainties related to the distances derived in the first step is proposed to determine the user's optimal position. The test results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm for determining the distance error achieves a value of less than 2.2 m at 90%, while for the positioning error, it achieves a value of less than 2.4 m at 90%. Compared with the traditional methods, the positioning error of our method is reduced by 33% to 38% for different smartphones and scenarios.

J	Shan, GY; Roh, BH				Shan, Gaoyang; Roh, Byeong-hee			A slotted random request scheme for connectionless data transmission in bluetooth low energy 5.0	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; BLE 4; 2; BLE 5; 0; Connectionless communication; Internet of Things	DISCOVERY	Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a personal area network (PAN) technology that has been widely implemented in various Internet of Things (IoT) services. BLE defines a connectionless communication method based on request-response to more effectively adapt to services with high flexibility requirements. This communication method can be divided into three steps: the neighbor discovery process (NDP), scan request, and scan response. First, the NDP enables a device known as the scanner to discover another device known as the advertiser nearby. In the second step, the scanner sends a scan request to the advertiser which, after receiving the scan request, sends a data packet in response. Unfortunately, this method is flawed in that the simultaneous discovery of an advertiser by multiple scanners would cause the request packets they send to collide with high probability. In fact, these collisions may always occur when scanners continue to discover common advertisers. To solve this problem, various schemes have been proposed to reduce the probability of a collision. However, these schemes are only suitable for application scenarios with fewer scanners; when more scanners are present, their latency and energy consumption increase rapidly. This prompted us to propose a scheme to improve the performance of the connectionless communication method. In addition, convex optimization was used in the proposed model to minimize the transmission delay and energy consumption. The final simulation results prove that the proposed scheme effectively reduces the delay and the energy consumption when many scanners are involved.

A combination of different techniques can enhance the overall robustness of such systems. In this work, we present fusion possibilities of coarse Bluetooth Low Energy localization based on the received signal strength indicator and the finer ultrasound time difference of arrival (TDOA) technique. This approach offers the advantage to robustify the high-accuracy ultrasonic localization in areas with non-optimal coverage. Moreover, the data fusion enables to enhance the overall localization area in a cost effective manner. This contribution proposes and evaluates (i) novel methods of how the ultrasonic system can be extended to a constrained area and (ii) a novel possibility to incorporate available Bluetooth signal strength information in the TDOA algorithm to improve accuracy.

Therefore, to accurately capture the dynamic nature of the occupants' movement patterns, researchers have proposed various indoor localisation technologies to infer occupancy information with varying degrees of accuracy and resolution. Among these technologies, the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology emerged as a popular alternative due to its availability in smartphone devices, as well as its low cost and power demand. In this study, we proposed a scalable and less intrusive occupancy detection method that leverages existing BLE technologies found in smartphone devices to perform zone-level occupancy localisation, without the need for a mobile application. The proposed method uses a network of BLE beacons for data collection before passing the pre-processed data into a machine learning model to infer the occupants' zone-level location. A supervised ensemble model and a semi-supervised clustering model were proposed and evaluated to identify the best performing model. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated during a five-week case study involving two office spaces in an academic building in Singapore. While the supervised ensemble model produced the best performance in terms of accuracy and macro-average fl-score, the semi-supervised model was able to produce a reasonable performance while using a fraction of the training data (<4%) and time needed by the supervised model. By analysing the occupancy information obtained through the best performing model, we further identified a set of occupancy profiles to represent the diverse occupancy patterns observed in the study area.

Bluetooth Low Energy, a Standard for This Evolution	SENSORS			English	Article						bluetooth low energy; mesh topology; Industry 4.0; Collaborative Mesh; Internet of Things (IoT); sensor network		Current sensor networks need to be improved and updated to satisfy new essential requirements of the Internet of Things, where cutting-edge applications will appear. These requirements are: total coverage, zero fails (high performance), scalability and sustainability (hardware and software). We are going to evaluate Bluetooth Low Energy as wireless transmission technology and as the ideal candidate for these improvements, due to its low power consumption, its low cost radio chips and its ability to communicate with users directly, using their smartphones or smartbands. However, this technology is relatively recent, and standard network topologies are not able to fulfil its new requirements. To address these shortcomings, the implementation of other more flexible topologies (as the mesh topology) will be very interesting. After studying it in depth, we have identified certain weaknesses, for example, specific devices are needed to provide network scalability, and the need to choose between high performance or sustainability. In this paper, after presenting the studies carried out on these new technologies, we propose a new packet format and a new BLE mesh topology, with two different configurations: Individual Mesh and Collaborative Mesh. Our results show how this topology improves the scalability, sustainability, coverage and performance.

We provide experimental data comparing power consumption of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee and ANT protocols for a cyclic sleep scenario, in which a short-range and low-power wireless sensor node periodically sends a data packet to a remote 'hub' with intervening sleep intervals. Devices such as wearable health monitors often use this scenario when interfacing with a mobile phone-based hub. For all measured sleep intervals BLE achieved lower power consumption (10.1 uA, 3.3 V supply at 120 s interval), compared with ZigBee (15.7 uA), and ANT (28.2 uA). Most of the power consumption differences can be attributed to the time taken for a node to connect to the hub after waking up and the use of sleep between individual RF packets. For the three protocols we determined a sleep interval at which the trade-off between power consumption and data rate is optimized.

The previous work in this field has mostly focused on optimizing the transmission throughput and power consumption. However, not much work has been reported on a systematic evaluation of the data packet loss of BLE in the wearable healthcare ecosystem, which is essential for reliable and secure data transmission. Considering that diverse wearable devices are used as peripherals and off-the-shelf smartphones (Android, iPhone) or Raspberry Pi with various chipsets and operating systems (OS) as hubs in the wearable ecosystem, there is an urgent need to understand the factors that influence data loss in BLE and develop a mitigation solution to address the data loss issue. In this work, we have systematically evaluated packet losses in Android and iOS based wearable ecosystems and proposed a reduced transmission frequency and data bundling strategy along with queue-based packet transmission protocol to mitigate data packet loss in BLE. The proposed protocol provides flexibility to the peripheral device to work with the host either in real-time mode for timely data transmission or offline mode for accumulated data transmission when there is a request from the host. The test results show that lowered transmission frequency and data bundling reduce the packet losses to less than 1%. The queue-based packet transmission protocol eliminates any remaining packet loss by using re-request routines. The data loss mitigation protocol developed in this research can be widely applied to the BLE-based wearable ecosystem for various applications, such as body sensor networks (BSN), the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart homes.

In this paper, the procedures involved in these activities are discussed and optimized for automated treatment with mobile devices. To this purpose, a novel remote control application for the management and detection of faults and breakdowns of collective water distribution networks in irrigation systems has been developed. The developed platform makes use of BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) technology to provide contactless, context-and-positioning sensitive information to the user, simplifying periodic inspections and repairing tasks of the network infrastructure. Devices would be equipped with BLE-enabled motes capable of transmitting a beacon signal for equipment discovering. Operators in turn, would carry tablets or smartphones configured to detect the motes and stablish a link in case additional data must be exchanged. The tablet also allows the operator to revise and fill in a device's form customized with context sensitive information gathered from both the mote and the enterprise cloud services and finally, to update the information in the online databases.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, interferences like effects of multipath and reflection of the signals significantly raise great challenges to the positioning accuracy at in-vehicle environment. This article presents a novel high-precision in-vehicle localization method, namely, the LOC-in-a-Car, based on functional exploration and full use of multi-channel received signal strength indicator of Bluetooth Low Energy. To achieve higher positioning precision, a hierarchical computation algorithm based on Adaboost and support vector machine is proposed in our method. In particular, we also proposed a device calibration method to deal with the heterogeneity of different smartphone terminals. We developed an Android app as a component in which the channel time-sharing acquisition method is fulfilled, enabling smartphones to distinguish data from multi-channels. The system performance is verified via intensive experiments, of which the results show that our method can distinguish the locations of driver or passengers with an accuracy ranging from 86.80% to 92.02% for each seat on Nexus phone, and the overall accuracy is 89.86%, with standard deviation of 2.64%. On Huawei phone, the accuracy ranges from 85.43% to 93.33% with overall accuracy of 89.75% and standard deviation of 3.07%. Both outperform the existing methods.

The complete BLE TX achieves a total energy per bit of 3.5nJ in an open-loop transmission scheme due to the ultra-low startup energy of the system. The overall system architecture of the BLE TX includes an RF front-end, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator (XO), a GFSK modulator, and a digital baseband including a SPI interface. An enhanced capacitively loaded three-stage inverter chain XO is proposed, featuring a 10.2nJ startup-energy, a 150 mu s startup time, and a 70 mu W steady-state power. The steady-state frequency inaccuracy of the XO is 14 ppm with less than 26 mu s cycle-to-cycle jitter. The BLE TX is fabricated in 65nm CMOS technology and it consumes an average power of 2.17mW to transmit an advertisement packet consisting of 368 bits entirely over 600 mu s including the startup time. Duty-cycling operation is implemented through power gating achieving an average power consumption of 3.72 mu W (1.86x sleep power) when transmitting a BLE advertising message every 753ms. In our target application, by using these techniques, we are able to extend a common coin battery's lifetime to more than 20 years.

Despite its growing significance for phone-to-peripheral communication, BLE's smartphone system performance characteristics are not well understood. As others, we experienced mixed erratic performance results in our BLE based smartphone-centric applications. In these applications, developers can only access low-level functionalities through multiple layers of OS and hardware abstractions. We propose an experimental framework for such systems, with which we perform experiments on a variety of modern smartphones.

The BLE implantation is aimed at boat identification and certification. We use four parameters to measure the performance of BLE signal strength, e.g., solar panel usage (with/without solar panel usage), weather effect (sunny/rain), sea wave form (shallow/tidal waters), and distance. The specification of BLE and boat identification system is also presented. From the experiment, we found that BLE signal strength performance is impacted by four parameters including its combined parameters: (a) the highest hour of the detected signal is generated when the boats are connected to the solar panel; (b) the boats transmitting the signal in sunny weather; (c) the boats are in shallow water sea wave; (d) the boats are in sunny weather and connected to solar panel will have a detectable distance for up to 30 m compared to without solar panel connection, it will only have a detectable distance for up to 15 m. It is suggested for future recommendations to expand this study with the newest BLE version and better solar panel equipment to get higher signal strength performance.

Knowing the frequency and duration of magnifier use would be helpful to document increased magnifier use after successful rehabilitation training, or conversely, to know when someone has abandoned a magnifier and requires assistance. Estimote Sticker BLE beacon sensors were attached to the handles of optical handheld magnifiers and dispensed to eight LV subjects to use at home. Temperature and motion data from the BLE beacon sensors were collected every second by a custom mobile application on a nearby smartphone and transmitted to a secure database server. Subjects noted the date and start/end times of their magnifier use in a diary log. Each of the 99 diary-logged self-reports of magnifier use across subjects was associated with BLE beacon sensor recordings of motion (mean 407 instances; SD 365) and increased temperature (mean 0.20 & DEG;C per minute; SD 0.16 & DEG;C) (mean total magnitude 5.4 & DEG;C; SD 2.6 & DEG;C). Diary-logged duration of magnifier use (mean 42 min; SD 24) was significantly correlated with instances of motion (p < 0.001) and rate of temperature increase (p < 0.001) recorded by the BLE beacon sensors. The BLE beacon sensors reliably detected meaningfully increased temperature, coupled with numerous instances of motion, when magnifiers were used for typical reading tasks at home by people with LV.

By the time a paraeducator ('para') is able to break away and record events, behavior counts can be forgotten. This paper presents a paraeducator glove design that can help to track behaviors with minimal distraction by allowing a paraeducator to touch their thumb to one of their other four fingers, where each finger represents a different behavior. Count data are packaged by a microcontroller board on the glove and then sent wirelessly to a smart phone via a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) link. A customized BLE profile was designed for this application to promote real-time recording. These data can be forwarded to a database for further analysis. This para glove design addresses basic needs of a wearable device that employs BLE, including local data collection, BLE data transmission, and remote data recording. More functional sensors can be added to this platform to support other wearable scenarios.

Even though Global Positioning System (GPS) provides an efficient outdoor Positioning System (PS), indoor positioning techniques fail to provide the same level of accuracy and efficiency. The previous methods were based merely on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). Recently, with the introduction of the new Bluetooth standard v5.1, the Angle of Arrival (AoA) method provides new opportunities for asset tracking and indoor positioning. However, Bluetooth suffers from an inherent problem of multipath effects, noise, phase/frequency shift, and fluctuations. In this paper, we propose a curve fitting and correction method to improve the accuracy of the received signal from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules. The results illustrate a potential improvement in increasing the overall angular accuracy of BLE-direction finding.

Scanners applying this algorithm can achieve a low latency whilst consuming only a fraction of the power that existing mechanisms can achieve at a similar latency. Furthermore, the power consumption can scale with the incoming network traffic and in contrast to the existing mechanisms, scanners can operate without any frame loss given ideal network conditions. The algorithm does not require any changes to advertisers, hence, stays compatible with existing devices. Performance evaluated via simulation and experiments on real hardware shows a 37 percent lower power consumption compared to the best existing scan setting while even achieving a slightly lower latency which proves that this algorithm can be used to improve the quality of service of connection-less Bluetooth communication or reduce the connection establishment time of connection-oriented communication.

Although BLE devices are designed to run on a small battery for a few years, several attempts have been made to extend BLE lifetime through various techniques. In particular, emerging approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) can be utilized to further improve the BLE energy efficiency. For this purpose, this article proposes a Q-learning-based scheduling algorithm for BLE. The proposed scheduling algorithm dynamically adjusts the key parameters that govern the operation of the BLE transmission scheme. These key parameters, namely, the length of connection interval and the number of packets to transmit during the interval, have a profound effect on energy efficiency and the quality of service (QoS) specified in terms of maximum latency. According to the framework of reinforcement learning, our Q-learning-based scheduling algorithm is appropriately constructed to simultaneously provide a longer network lifetime and satisfy the QoS requirement. The numerical results show that the proposed Q-learning-based approach significantly increases the network lifetime compared to alternative methods while meeting QoS requirements.

J	Agnoletto, D; Jonsson, M; de Freitas, EP				Agnoletto, Daniel; Jonsson, Magnus; de Freitas, Edison Pignaton			Time Slot Transmission Scheme with Packet Prioritization for Bluetooth Low Energy Devices used in Real-Time Applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WIRELESS INFORMATION NETWORKS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Real-time communication requirements; Time slot management; Packet prioritization	PERFORMANCE	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the most important technologies that feed the growing field of Internet of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks. Due to its flexibility and unique low power-consumption, an increasing number of industrial devices, household appliances and wearables are being designed using it. However, the real-time demands of these networks such as timing and Quality of Service are not fully covered by the protocol itself. To help improve and offer some control over these characteristics, this paper presents a time slot transmission scheme with packet prioritization. It is based on the division and allocation of the connection interval to two types of messages: real-time and ordinary. The goal is to offer the lowest packet loss and time guarantees for real-time messages, while providing acceptable throughput for ordinary ones. Since the probability of a BLE connection to close increases with the number of packets sent through it, the position where a real-time packet is being sent as well as the number of ordinary messages in a connection represent key factors. The use of the first and last slot for real-time packets with ordinary flow restricted to the space between them decreases the transmission delay uncertainty and allows probability tuning based on the number of ordinary messages. Simulations were performed using the proposed scheme and a reduction of more than 100 times in the delay variance was observed for real-time transmissions. Regarding reliability, around 5% of the packets were lost for a bit error rate of 10(-3).

With BLE 5.0, the way beacons deliver more information can move away from the current model of app-paired-to-device to a connectionless IoT. When users pass areas with installed BLE beacons, their mobile devices can receive specials, promotional contents, and discount coupons. However, the beacons are only broadcasting. This means that beacons are not able to collect information from the users with mobile devices. In this paper, we propose responsive advertising with the wait-slot scheme (RAWS) based on advertising extensions to improve the performance of the discovery process before further communications in BLE networks. Besides, we consider the energy consumption and investigate the latency-energy tradeoff with our proposed scheme. The theoretical lower bounds for both latency and energy of the discovery process as well as their tradeoff are presented. In addition, we formulate the state transition diagram for analyzing the performance of our proposed scheme. Simulation results validated by analysis results show that RAWS indeed improves the latency and the energy consumption of the discovery process in BLE networks.

In this regard, Angle of Arrival (AoA) localization is one of the most reliable techniques because of its low estimation error. BLE-based AoA localization, however, is in its infancy as only recently direction-finding feature is introduced to the BLE specification. Furthermore, AoA-based approaches are prone to noise, multi-path, and path-loss effects. The paper proposes an efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based indoor localization framework to tackle these issues specific to BLE-based settings. We consider indoor environments without presence of Line of Sight (LoS) links affected by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with different Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) and Rayleigh fading channel. Moreover, by assuming a 3-D indoor environment, the destructive effect of the elevation angle of the incident signal is considered on the position estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed CNN-AoA framework is evaluated via an experimental testbed, where In-phase/Quadrature (I/Q) samples, modulated by Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK), are collected by four BLE beacons. Simulation results corroborate effectiveness of the proposed CNN-based AoA technique to track mobile agents with high accuracy in the presence of noise and Rayleigh fading channel.

In this pandemic situation, we need a robust solution to flatten the curve of COVID-19 so that people do not get sick, so our economy and supply chain stays running, and people's risk can be minimized. Some techniques are available to maintain social distancing, but most are based on visual recognition, which is not effectively applicable everywhere and comparatively expensive. To overcome this issue and make it more effective and smoother, an android application has been developed for the Social Distancing Alert System (SDAS). The system is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity detection technology, which uses the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Transmission Power (TxPower) of user's android handsets for the estimation of real-time social distancing status and to alert them. It notifies users through real-time popup notifications on the screen of the handsets and by vibration and notification sound when another app user gets closer to a range of 2 meters with four levels of granularity. This application also provides other compelling features like past social distancing status tracking of the past 30 days, power-saving, and QR scanning to ignore specific people without an internet connection.

In this environment, various nodes will collect the data and each node may use a wireless communication technology like Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity, and Zigbee for transmitting and receiving the information. Starting from wearable technologies-for example, Fit bits and Google Glass-to automobiles, companies are integrating Bluetooth capability into modern gadgets at a more noteworthy rate. Bluetooth's emerging omnipresence presents unique associations for the future. Bluetooth Low Energy can be used for the IoT because it is a suitable technology for transmitting and receiving the data using low energy wirelessly. However, there are some attacks described which also are of concern so as to possess added number of satisfied customers.

Beside to security needs, indoor positioning system should be used for emergency evacuation needs in the Data Center. Indoor positioning has its challenges where global positioning system (GPS) becomes ineffective when used indoors because of no line of sight (LOS) with satellite. Currently, the indoor positioning is mainly based on the wireless signal, such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc. In this paper, indoor positioning is developed based on Bluetooth 4.0 beacon technology and its RSSI value. As the classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors (FkNN) algorithm are evaluated. Impact of Kalman Filter application to improve the accuracy also being tested.

J	Sultania, AK; Delgado, C; Famaey, J				Sultania, Ashish Kumar; Delgado, Carmen; Famaey, Jeroen			Enabling Low-Latency Bluetooth Low Energy on Energy Harvesting Batteryless Devices Using Wake-Up Radios	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); wake-up radio (WuR); friendship; poll; batteryless; Low Power Node (LPN)	SENSOR; BLE	With the growth of the number of IoT devices, the need for changing batteries is becoming cumbersome and has a significant environmental impact. Therefore, batteryless and maintenance-free IoT solutions have emerged, where energy is harvested from the ambient environment. Energy harvesting is relevant mainly for the devices that have a low energy consumption in the range of thousands of micro-watts. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the most popular technologies and is highly suitable for such batteryless energy harvesting devices. Specifically, the BLE friendship feature allows a Low Power Node (LPN) to sleep most of the time. An associated friend node (FN) temporarily stores the LPN's incoming data packets. The LPN wakes up and polls periodically to its FN retrieving the stored data. Unfortunately, the LPNs typically experience high downlink (DL) latency. To resolve the latency issue, we propose combining the batteryless LPN with a secondary ultra-low-power wake-up radio (WuR), which enables it to always listen for an incoming wake-up signal (WuS). The WuR allows the FN to notify the LPN when new DL data is available by sending a WuS. This removes the need for frequent polling by the LPN, and thus saves the little valuable energy available to the batteryless LPN. In this article, we compare the standard BLE duty-cycle based polling and WuR-based data communication between an FN and a batteryless energy-harvesting LPN. This study allows optimising the LPN configuration (such as capacitor size, polling interval) based on the packet arrival rate, desired packet delivery ratio and DL latency at different harvesting powers. The result shows that WuR-based communication performs best for high harvesting power (400 mu W and above) and supports Poisson packet arrival rates as low as 1 s with maximum PDR using a capacitor of 50 mF or more.

In this article, a smart parking system that operates both indoor and outdoor is introduced. The system is based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and uses particle filtering to improve its accuracy. Through simple BLE connectivity with smartphones, an intuitive parking system is designed and deployed. The proposed system pairs each spot with a unique BLE beacon, providing users with guidance to free parking spaces and a secure and automated payment scheme based on real-time usage of the parking space. Three sets of experiments were conducted to examine different aspects of the system. A particle filter is implemented in order to increase the system performance and improve the credence of the results. Through extensive experimentation in both indoor and outdoor parking spaces, the system was able to correctly predict which spot the user has parked in, as well as estimate the distance of the user from the beacon.

Thereby, BLE makes feasible the wireless transmission of information from smart objects such as wearable clinical devices, ambient sensors and actuators. These smart objects are starting to be internet-enabled devices, reaching the so denominated Internet of Things (IoT). Our research work is focused on analyze the capabilities of these technologies for continuous data transmission and integration of clinical sensors in home-care and Ambient Assisted Living environments. For this purpose, this work analyses exhaustively the capabilities from BLE and compare this with the capabilities from Bluetooth 2.1. In addition, it has been considered the communications requirements from different clinical devices such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a capnograph. It is concluded that the performance from BLE is lower than Bluetooth Classic (Bluetooth 2.1) for continuous communications, since BLE is based on attributes (datapoints) transfer instead of offering a communication session where can be transmitted as much packets as required, without any size constraint. Therefore, it is necessary to perform data compression/aggregation when the amount of data to send is too large to be stored in a BLE attribute. This work also presents how to apply pre-processing techniques that greatly reduces the transmission overload (performs signal compression) in order to allow the continuous transmission of the ECG and capnograph signal through BLE making so feasible the integration of continuous clinical devices via BLE.

Typically, in BLE localization, the beacons transmit advertisement messages while moving devices infer their location from radio signal strength measurements. Previous work has noted that three radio channels used for advertisement transmission exhibit different propagation conditions including frequency dependent shadowing and multipath. Because most of the consumer electronic devices report only the measured signal strength value without the number of a channel in which it was measured, the variance of the measurements increases and adversely affects the accuracy of localization. Information on the channel used can improve the localization accuracy, however, the existing approaches are limited to three advertisement channels, ignoring the remaining 37 channels available in BLE communication. This article analyses the impact of channel diversity on the accuracy of BLE-based indoor localization. In contrast to previous work, we use signal strength measurements from all 40 channels and show that channel diversity can significantly improve the localization accuracy. Experiments conducted in 100m(2) office area show that using signal strength measurements in 40 channels improves the average localization accuracy by approximately 50% and 20% compared to the use of 3 channels without and with information on the channel used, respectively. Overhead of the proposed method can be reduced through careful selection of the radio channels used in measurements. We propose a channel selection method which allows to significantly improve the localization accuracy using measurements collected from between 10 and 15 channels.

The existence of human bodies is proved to influence BLE signals. In this paper, the effect of overcrowdedness on the performance of BLE-based positioning systems is studied. Real experiments are conducted in places with large and small areas. Both proximity and location beacons are evaluated with different transmission powers. Compared to uncrowded environments, results show random, but often manageable, changes in the received signal strength and position estimation accuracy. The logarithmic path loss model is found unsuitable for small areas and its parameters are noticeably affected by the crowdedness. Location beacons are found more robust against the increase in crowdedness than proximity counterparts. For these location beacons, the overcrowdedness maximally changes the signal strength by 8.6 dBm, the coverage range by 24 m, the proximity estimation accuracy by 18%, and the distance estimation accuracy by 41%.

Although the BLE standard defines advanced security mechanisms, there are known security attacks for BLE and BLE-enabled field devices must be tested thoroughly against these attacks. This article identifies the possible attacks for BLE-enabled field devices relevant for industrial automation. It also presents a framework for defining and executing BLE security attacks and evaluates it on three BLE devices. All tested devices are vulnerable and this confirms that there is a need for better security testing tools as well as for additional defense mechanisms for BLE devices.

Frequency-Scanned Active Monopulse Radar based on Bluetooth Low Energy Devices using an Array of Two Planar Leaky-Wave Antennas	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 9TH IEEE-APS TOPICAL CONFERENCE ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS (IEEE APWC' 19)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)	SEP 09-13, 2019	Granada, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Antennas & Propagat Soc, Torino Wireless Fdn, Politecnico Torino, Univ Granada, Univ Carlos III Madrid, IEIIT CNR, Int Union Radio Sci, Torino Wireless Fdn, SELENE Srl		Direction-of-Departure Detection; Antenna Arrays; Monopulse Systems; Leaky-Wave Antennas; Bluetooth Low Energy		A novel technique for angular location of mobile devices, with a wide field of view (FoV) and low cost is presented in this work. The technique is based on the use of the three Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertising channels, which are located at the frequencies 2.402 GHz, 2.426 GHz and 2.48 GHz, and the received power information included in the RSSI field of the BLE packets. With the use of an array of two planar and passive leaky-wave antennas (LWA), with two ports each (a total of four ports), due to their inherent frequency scanning, 12 directive beams can he synthesized (one for each frequency channel and port of the array), with different pointing angles and overlapping to obtain different monopulse functions combining information from each port and channel, which complement each other to cover a FoV in the wide angular range [-60 degrees, +60 degrees]. Analog and digital measurements are presented to show the viability and limitations of the technique.

One of the potential approaches for information gathering and dissemination on smartphones is through cooperatively relaying among user devices based on short range wireless communications. To facilitate information dissemination and to improve user experiences, data transfer that neither requires connection setup nor interferes users' current operations is highly desirable. In this work, we study the feasibility of automatic information dissemination based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) legacy advertising. To improve applicability, we additionally propose an automatic connectionless undirected information dissemination (ACLUID) scheme to effectively exchange information among users without knowing the BLE device addresses in advance. We analyze the performance of the proposed ACLUID scheme to investigate the effectiveness of message exchange. By applying the ACLUID scheme, users can opportunistically exchange some messages of interest when they are occasionally located within the effective communication range of BLE with BLE activities running in the background. In addition, we implement our scheme in Android-based smartphones and perform some experiments to examine the feasibility of ACLUID under various scenarios. According to the experimental results, a large message can be completely transferred from an advertiser to a scanner within a short period of time with a high probability.

Many researches use the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor localization, in particular using the measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This paper presents an inverse model of the distance between two BLE devices depending on the RSSI and on the Packet Error Rate (PER). Furthermore, we derived a model of the accuracy of the estimated distance estimated by the RSSI and PER measurements. Many measurements have been carried out to validate the model.

Starting from the classical Master/Slave paradigm of Bluetooth, we build two new layers based on BLE stack that allow the final user to set-up, in a fast way, the desired network topology while hiding the complexity and low-level details of the BLE stack. We also prototype, as a proof of concept, an open source Android library [1] that implements our communication paradigm and an Android application that allows the exchange of text messages across the mesh network. Last, we demonstrate how BE-Mesh enables Internet access sharing with the whole mesh from a single Internet-connected device.

Energy harvesting from ambient sources becomes crucial to support the uninterrupted execution of such applications. We choose the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network to analyze a batteryless node using the BLE Low power node (LPN) feature. We develop a prototype using a mini photovoltaic solar panel for indoor light harvesting using sunlight or a light bulb to power the BLE LPN. Due to the unpredictability of energy harvesting and the use of a small capacitor instead of a battery, the BLE LPN's power can become intermittent. This causes the device to frequently switch between the ON and OFF states as it is unaware of its available energy while trying to perform scheduled tasks. In contrast, an energy-aware LPN can try to avoid the OFF state. With the knowledge of the capacitor voltage, it can proactively delay the execution of upcoming sensing or communication tasks and provide some time to recharge the capacitor while consuming a minimum amount of energy by switching itself to the SLEEP state. This article presents the developed prototype and evaluates an energy-unaware and -aware batteryless BLE LPN communicating uni-directional downlink only or bi-directional for different capacitor sizes at different light-harvesting powers. The experimental results conclude that the energy-aware batteryless LPN performs better for both uni- and bi-directional communication with improved DL data latency up to 74% and avoiding restarts.

J	Sun, DZ; Tian, YG				Sun, Dazhi; Tian, Yangguang			Address Privacy of Bluetooth Low Energy	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Bluetooth standard; low energy; resolvable private address mechanism; traceability; privacy; cryptography		Bluetooth low energy (LE) devices have been widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless personal area networks (WPAN). However, attackers may compromise user privacy by tracking the addresses of the LE device. The resolvable private address (RPA) mechanism provides address privacy protection for the LE device. Similar to Zhang and Lin's work in CCS 2022, we investigate the privacy of the RPA mechanism in this paper. Our contributions are threefold. First, we discover that the RPA mechanism has a privacy weakness. The attacker can track the targeted device by exploiting the runs of the RPA mechanism when he intercepts the targeted device's obsolete RPA value. Second, we propose an improved RPA mechanism to overcome the privacy weakness in the RPA mechanism. The improved RPA mechanism leads to a small amount of extra overheads without requiring modification to the basic cryptographic tools used in the standard specification. Third, we formalize a privacy model to capture the address privacy of the RPA mechanisms. Our improved RPA mechanism provides enhanced privacy guarantees to Bluetooth LE devices in wireless personal applications.

In addition, a linkage between device properties / values to logical identifiers used in process control code has to be adapted using a correct mapping of memory areas within the process memory acquired from the device. In order to exchange an automation device by a similar one, all steps above have to be adapted and checked until it can be used productively. To meet flexibility requirements of future automation scenarios, the integration and commissioning process of automation devices has to be made more flexible, less error-prone and less dependent of boundary conditions. This paper presents a concept for self-description of automation devices based on wireless communication using 802.15.1 (Bluetooth Low Energy) to facilitate commissioning processes of devices and assist engineers in process definition and device selection during development phase. A demonstrator is realized to validate this concept.

It exploits fast switching speed and low internal capacitances of deep-nanoscale CMOS devices to realize a high intermediate-frequency (IF) architecture based on switched-capacitor-based charge-domain bandpass filtering. Power consumption is minimized by aggressively reducing the size of MOS devices and judiciously applying a samplingrate decimation. The resultant increase in the flicker noise is mitigated by placing the IF frequency beyond the flicker corner frequency. Likewise, the decimation-induced aliasing is mitigated by DT filtering of preceding stages. The BLE RX is fully standard-compliant and achieves a record-low-power consumption of 2.75 mW (including its local oscillator) while delivering the state-of-the-art performance: 6.5-dB noise figure and -19-dBm third-order input intercept point, with a direct antenna connection and thus without the typical external bandpass filters.

All around us now lies an invisible mesh of communication from devices embedded in seemingly everything. Inevitably some of that communication flying around our heads will contain data that must be protected or otherwise shielded from tampering. The responsibility to protect this sensitive information from malicious actors as it travels through the air then falls upon the standards used to communicate this data. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these standards, the aim of this paper is to put its security standards to test.

Significant market opportunities for BLE mesh networking have motivated the recent development of two different BLE mesh networking standards, Bluetooth Mesh and 6BLEMesh, produced by the Bluetooth SIG and IETF, respectively. These two standards follow different technical approaches. In this article, we present the main features of Bluetooth Mesh and 6BLEMesh, and investigate their performance characteristics and trade-offs.

In this paper, a novel technique, which provides efficient operation by adapting BLE protocol in accordance with consumable power limitations, is proposed. The essence of this technique lies in the observation that a considerable decrease in power comsumption can be achieved by lengthening advertisement intervals. The scheduling algortihm, which was developed as a result of problem formulation and analysis, maximizes advertisement throughput and minimizes the expected total waste of receiving attempts produced by near wireless receivers while setting advertisement intervals according to energy harvesting rates.

The LWA array is completely passive, fabricated in a low-cost FR4 printed-circuit board and designed to multiplex to different angular directions in space each one of the three associated BLE advertising channels that are used for periodically transmitting the ID of the beacon. This way, the use of more expensive hardware associated to electronic phased-array steering/beam-switching is avoided. Four commercial BLE modules are connected to the four ports of the array, producing an advanced BLE beacon that synthesizes twelve directive beams (one per each port and advertising channel) distributed over a wide Field of View (FoV) of 120 degrees in the azimuthal plane. Then, any BLE enabled IoT device located within this FoV can scan the messages from the beacon and obtain the corresponding Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of these twelve beams to estimate the relative DoD by using amplitude-monopulse signal processing, thus dispensing from complex In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) data acquisition or high computational load. We propose an angular windowing technique to eliminate angular ambiguities and increase the angular resolution, reporting a root mean squared angular error of 3.7 degrees in a wide FoV of 120 degrees.

In intelligent urban settings, integrated and sustainable mobility plays a key role, especially for children, whose ability to move independently throughout their neighborhood is fundamental, both for themselves and their community. Our case study comes from a stepping stone toward independent mobility, namely a group of children walking to school under adult supervision. For this scenario, we offer a tool based on wireless, wearable nodes that supports adults to safely form and manage a group of children. We describe the application requirements, generalizing them beyond this particular use case. We also offer a prototype implementation that exploits Bluetooth Low Energy connectionless communication to build bi-directional information exchange for group management. Simulations and pilot tests validate the proposed approach in terms of scalability, network performance and battery life.	[Giovanelli, D.; Milosevic, B.; Kiraly, C.; Murphy, A.

In order to use this system for a collaborative brain-computer-interface (BCI) multiple EEG sub-systems with a common visually and auditory evoked potential (VEP/AEP) stimulator, a video camera and a PC, all connected to a WLAN, are required. Since each of the components has its own software clock typically based on a quartz crystal, a difference in skew and offset between all system components is induced after a few seconds from their cold start; this is due to the quartz instability of +/- 50 ppm. To evaluate evoked potentials of different test subjects synchronous in time in a group experiment scenario, it is necessary to implement a common time reference among the entire system. To achieve time synchronization without modifying the existing hardware/software a novel synchronization add-on, and a synchronization center based on Bluetooth were implemented and experimentally evaluated.

Hence, there is a need for the development of methods that could be applied for those purposes. This paper presents the results of research on an experimental system for localizing people being evacuated from a building. The proposed solution was designed as a part of the building evacuation management system. The method used for finding location belongs to the class of proximity-type methods and is based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) information of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) devices. The devices used to build the system (BLE receivers) and the evacuee's wristband (BLE transmitters) are low-budget electronic modules. The paper presents preliminary research and the process of selecting data processing methods, as well as the results of tests of the experimental network created for the evacuation system. The results of measurements and statistical analyses of the properties of the RSSI parameter of the BLE signal transmission between the modules used in the designed system are presented. In addition, the results of RSSI measurements and the analyses of RSSI recorded under varying environmental conditions in the building are presented. The choice of the data processing method and its parameters was made with the use of the determined probabilities of the nearest locator node detection. Finally, the performance of the experimental installation of the evacuee tracking system was tested and the effectiveness of the proximity method was evaluated. The experimental tests aimed to analyze the detection range and the impact of shading. They also allowed for determining the mean error and for estimating the maximum position determination error. It should be emphasized that the proposed position estimation method has a very low computational load, allowing the implementation of an extensive real-time system on a typical personal computer. Although the proposed system should be classified as a coarse positioning system, its features such as low cost, simplicity, flexibility, the use of commonly available components and low requirements for computational load make it attractive. Such a system is directly transferable to other applications in, for example, Industry 4.0.

How to achieve bidirectional communication between multiple implants in the body with limited volume and power consumption becomes a challenge in biomedical engineering. This paper designs and implements a method of communication between in vivo implants based on low-power Bluetooth 4.0, which can establish bidirectional stable communication between one master and eight slave nodes. The master and slave circuits, which are exactly the same, uses commercial components with the volume only 21mm x 10mm x 2mm. Through testing, in the connection state during master cycle (T = 1s) with the slave sending data and without other peripherals, the operating current of the master is 80 uA and the slave is 154 uA, which basically meets the needs of communication between implants in vivo. Moreover, the circuit structure could be further optimized and compacted, which means the volume and power consumption of the communication board may be further reduced.

Many of us experience anxiety and discomfort when we forget to close our window or enter our car in the hot air. IOT system can be applied to solve this problem by controlling the window power. This research makes it easy for us either to open or to close car windows from around 10 to 30 meters separated from the vehicle through Android smartphone.

A two-dimensional model of the power emission characteristic is derived from measurements of the radiation pattern of BLE beacons carried out in an RF chamber. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for position estimation is then derived for this directional power emission model. With this lower bound on the RMS positioning error the coverage of different beacon network configurations can be evaluated. For near-optimal network planing an evolutionary optimization algorithm for finding the best beacon placement is presented.

We are after a filtering distribution by Bayesian approximation using Monte Carlo sampling techniques. In a test environment decorated with multiple BLE sensors, the tracking relies only on the naturally unreliable received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the captured signals. We assume that the tracked BLE transmitter does not provide any other motion or position related information. Hence, the transition density is designed to be merely a diffusion where the probability measures are diffused into the neighboring space. This makes the diagonal error covariance factor of the prediction density, namely the diffusion factor, the most important parameter to be tuned on the fly. We first show an experimental proof of concept using synthetic data on real trajectories by comparing three parameter estimation approaches: static, decaying and adaptive diffusion factors. We then obtain the results on real data which show that online parameter sampling adapts to the observed data and yields lower error means and medians, but more importantly steady error distributions with respect to a large range of parameters.

Such devices are not reachable outside of their Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). However, users' needs are sometimes incompatible with this limited reachability. Our goal is to break this barrier and provide location-independent connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a new abstraction layer, called RCM (Remote Connection Manager) enabling transparent communication between an application and a remote short-range device.

Traditional contact tracing can be augmented by electronic tools called "electronic contact tracing" or "exposure notification.". Some methods were built to work with smartphones; however, smartphones are not prevalent in some high-contact areas (e.g., schools and nursing homes). We present the design and initial testing of low-cost, highly privacy preserving wearable exposure notification devices. Several devices were constructed based on existing hardware and operated independently of a smartphone. The method (devices and analyses) was not able to reliably use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) as a proxy for distance between pairs of devices; the accuracy of RSSI as a proxy for distance decreased dramatically outside of the idealized conditions. However, even an imperfect device could be useful for research on how people use and move through spaces. With some improvement, these devices could be used to understand disease spread and human or animal interaction in indoor environments.

This creates a huge demand of long-term health care. In many long-term care institutes, a caregiver has to take care of many elderly people at the same time. Some of them have been paralyzed in bed, while others are still able to move in the institutes. It is not uncommon that a caregiver has to spend a lot of time to find an elder to perform daily care operations, such as injections, medications, and blood pressure measuring. Elders may move in dangerous places, such as kitchens, stairs, and bathrooms. In this paper, we present an iBeacon-based indoor positioning system for long-term care institutes. Thus, the staffs of long-term care institutes can easily locate the elders, and be notified when some elders move in dangerous places.

However, wireless signals such as Bluetooth, tend to be affected by an obstruction, thus creating a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environment. This paper proposes a statistical technique for improving the accuracy of indoor positioning using BLE technology through detecting obstructions and compensating for signal degradation caused. Several experiments are conducted to observe the obstruction effect on the signal stability, computed in this paper using standard deviation. Results show a lower standard deviation for an NLOS environment. A threshold is suggested at 2.6 dBm to detect a line-of-sight (LOS) environment. The detection accuracy of this threshold is 76.25%; thus, in most cases, the technique will be able to differentiate an LOS from an NLOS environment. Using this technique, positioning in NLOS environments show an average of 1.13 metres improvement compared to positioning without using the technique.

J	Katila, R; Gia, TN; Westerlund, T				Katila, Risto; Gia, Tuan Nguyen; Westerlund, Tomi			Analysis of mobility support approaches for edge-based IoT systems using high data rate Bluetooth Low Energy 5	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Internet-of-Things; Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE); Mobility support; Handover; RSSI; Low latency; Real-time; Energy efficiency		In remote monitoring edge-based IoT applications, high latency caused by the mobility of a sensor device can cause serious consequences such as inaccurate analysis and low quality of services. Therefore, it is required to have mobility support approaches that help reduce latency while maintaining a connection, high quality of service, and energy efficiency. However, the number of mobility support approaches for high data rate IoT applications using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is limited and they have some disadvantages. For example. they have not been designed for edge-based applications where local computation occurs frequently. Many of them have not been implemented and tested in daily working environments with actual mobility cases. They have not comprehensively analyzed the mobility latency and energy consumption of sensor devices. Hence, this paper presents three possible mobility support approaches including passive and active handover mechanisms for edge-based IoT applications using high data rate BLE5. These approaches based on passive and active handover mechanisms are implemented and tested in an office environment. The results of latency and power consumption of a sensor device via many experiments are measured and analyzed. The results show that the presented mobility support approaches maintain the connection during mobility with a latency of around 900ms for many cases. The results also show that using BLE5's LE 2M physical layer consumes less power than using LE 1M physical layer. Specifically, it can reduce energy consumption when sending or receiving larger data sizes at faster rates.

Time of Arrival (TOA); direction of Arrival (DOA); Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); Access Point (AP)		In the period of wireless communication, Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) are getting enormous attention. These systems are construct to attain location information of individuals and objects inside a building. Now a day all the applicable wireless technologies used in this context are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based. These advancements are additionally decided for their ease of use, low cost and integration into wireless devices. However, these techniques are having some positioning errors along with specified region. Here, we introduce another wireless technology named Light Fidelity (Li-Fi), the basic convention of this technology is the transfer of information using light illumination by light emitting diodes. This article primarily established a set of evaluation indexes for the performance of these three Wi-Fi, BLE and Li-Fi technologies in indoor positioning scenarios. We compare the predefined IPSs in term of performance and limitations. After then outline the tradeoffs among these systems from the perspective of all evaluation entities. We show experimentally that Li-Fi technology achieves a high efficiency but fur accuracy, Wi-Fi is still better than Li-Fi and BLE technology.

The BLE standard contains basic requirements to implement this behavior. However, it does not specify how channels should be classified and disabled, leaving the details up to the implementations. In this paper, an implementation is presented and evaluated, based partially on existing work. A new algorithm for re-activating channels that were previously disabled in order to allow for operation in dynamic environments with changing background interference is proposed and demonstrated to deliver improvements over existing work, resulting in better connection stability. Finally, an evaluation under real-world conditions confirms the improvements to BLE connections that were previously only shown in controlled testing environments.

When data from the base sensing layer is provided by very low power technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, a class of vulnerabilities called Denial of Sleep attacks can be especially devastating to the network. These attacks can reduce the lifespan of the sensing nodes by several orders of magnitude, rendering the network largely unusable. This paper investigates a Denial of Sleep attack against the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol that allows a malicious actor to rapidly drain the battery of a targeted sensing node, including power analysis, simulation results, and an example implementation. The outcome will be utilized to build better defenses and more predictable environments.

Synchronization between transmitters and receivers is usually needed. In this paper, the use of BLE technology to achieve time synchronization by wirelessly triggered ultrasound transceivers is analyzed. Building on a previous work, the proposed solution uses BLE technology as communication infrastructure and achieves a level of synchronization compatible with Time of Flight (ToF)-based distance estimations and positioning. The proposed solution was validated experimentally. First, a measurement campaign of the time-synchronization delay for the adopted embedded platforms was carried out. Then, ToF-based distance estimations and positioning were performed. The results show that an accurate and low-cost ToF-based positioning system is achievable, using ultrasound transmissions and triggered by BLE RF transmissions.

For the optimal LC-based DCO layout, three different layouts, including different g(m) cell locations and an Al metal layer, were implemented, and performance was compared and verified for BLE application. The implemented neck DCO (NDCO), where the g(m) cell is located in the neck of the main inductor, showed superior performance compared to other layouts in terms of low phase noise and low power consumption. The designed NDCO had a low phase noise of -116.1 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz with a 0.5 mW power consumption. The supply voltage and oscillation frequency range were 0.8 V and 4.7-5.7 GHz, respectively, and the NDCO designed with the optimal layout had a good figure-of-merit of -192.6 dBc/Hz.

The commitment to make bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology the leader in IPS and their applications is clear: Since 2009, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has released several improved versions. BLE offers many advantages for IPS, e.g., their emitters or beacons are easily deployable, have low power consumption, give a high positioning accuracy and can provide advanced services to users. Fingerprinting is a popular indoor positioning algorithm that is based on the received signal strength (RSS); however, its main drawbacks are that data collection is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process and its main challenge is that positioning accuracy is affected by various factors. The purpose of this work was to develop a semi-automatic data collection support system in a BLE fingerprinting-based IPS to: (1) Streamline and shorten the data collection process, (2) carry out impact studies by protocol and channel on the static positioning accuracy related to configuration parameters of the beacons, such as transmission power (Tx) and the advertising interval (A), and their number and geometric distribution. With two types of systems-on-chip (SoCs) integrated in Bluetooth 5 beacons and in two different environments, our results showed that on average in the three BLE advertising channels, the configuration of the highest Tx (+4 dBm) in the beacons produced the best accuracy results. However, the lowest Tx (-20 dBm) did not worsen them excessively (only 11.8%). In addition, in both scenarios, when lowering the density of beacons by around 42.7%-50%, the error increase was only around 8%-9.2%.

Due to the simplified design of this protocol, there have been lots of security and privacy vulnerabilities. As billions of health care, personal fitness wearable, smart lock, industrial automation devices adopt this technology for communication, its vulnerabilities should be dealt with high priority. Some segregated works on BLE were performed focusing on various vulnerabilities, such as the insecure implementation of encryption, device authentication, user privacy, etc. However, there has been no comprehensive survey on the security vulnerabilities of this protocol. In this survey paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy for the security and privacy issues of BLE. We present possible attack scenarios for different types of vulnerabilities, classify them according to their severity, and list possible mitigation techniques. We also provide case studies regarding how different vulnerabilities can be exploited in real BLE devices.

The proposed quadrature LNA, which can provide accurate quadrature signals in the RF path, consists of a common-source amplifier with inductive degeneration and a quadrature generator based on a common-gate amplifier with a single RC network. Therefore, a BLE receiver using the proposed LNA can eliminate quadrature generating circuitry of the LO chain, thereby reducing power consumption. The implemented receiver is composed of the quadrature LNA, single-to-differential double-balanced active mixer, and second-order G(m)-C complex filter. Simulated in a 65-nm CMOS process, it achieves a conversion gain, noise figure, and an image rejection ratio of 53.2 dB, 4.81 dB and 38 dB, respectively, and consumes 2.2 mA from a supply voltage of 0.8 V.

Specifically, we propose to replace the conventional channel settling with a band settling that would be carried out only once per global device power up. The ADPLL locks to the center of the Bluetooth band (2440 MHz) upon system powerup and jointly performs an instantaneous channel hopping and Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) modulation in a twopoint manner to overcome the narrow PLL bandwidth (BW) due to the 32.768-kHz reference. Extensive calibrations linearize the effective cubic digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) transfer function to achieve a precise frequency range of hopping and modulation. Realized in 16-nm FinFET, it consumes <1 mW at <= 0.45 V, while achieving best-in-class performance and <100-ns hopping time.

A coin-battery-powered LDO-Free 2.4-GHz Bluetooth Low Energy/ZigBee receiver consuming 2 mA	INTEGRATION-THE VLSI JOURNAL			English	Article						Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); CMOS receiver; Current-reuse; Forward body bias; Low power; Quadrature LNA; Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO); I/Q mixers; ZigBee	FRONT-END; DESIGN	This paper describes a 1.5-V low dropout regulator (LDO)-free ultra-low-power 2.4-GHz CMOS receiver for direct-powering through a coin battery. By effective merging the quadrature low noise amplifier (LNA), in phase and quadrature (I/Q) mixers, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) in one cell, while removing the LDO, we fully utilize the available 1.5-V voltage supply for current-reuse between blocks, minimizing the dc current consumption. Specifically, a quadrature LNA operating as both common-source and common-drain provides the I/Q outputs in the signal path. Forward-body-bias applied to the transconductance stage of the I/Q mixers relaxes their voltage headroom consumption. Prototyped in 180-nm CMOS, the receiver exhibits a conversion gain (CG) of 23 dB, a noise figure (NF) of 13.8 dB and an input-referred 3rd-order intercept point (IIP3) of -14 dBm while consuming only 2 mA. The phase noise of the VCO is -118.5 dBc/Hz at 2.5 MHz offset. The low-cost technology and low current consumption renders the receiver suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) devices using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or ZigBee standards.

In this paper, we propose a 2-stage multipath mitigation technique which consists of RSSI filtering and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) combining methods. First, a low-complexity weighted average filter is proposed in the filtering stage. Then, a space diversity, where multiple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags are attached to the object being tracked, is presented in the combing stage. Here the signals from multiple tags are combined to provide signal stability. Measurement results showed that an overall position estimation error of around 1.5 m can be achieved by using the proposed technique with BLE anchor optimization.

The receiver employs a passive front-end zero-IF architecture, which is directly driven by a quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) without any buffering stage. The QVCO, embedded in a fractional-phase-locked loop (PLL), employs a passive network to cancel the parasitic magnetic coupling between the two cores so as to keep the quadrature phase error below 1.5 degrees. The PLL exhibits a high loop bandwidth of 1 MHz to sufficiently reduce the frequency pulling effects due to close-by interferers. The transmitter uses a direct-modulation Gaussian frequency-shift keying scheme in which small PMOS-based cells modulate the output signal of one of the cores of the QVCO. In the baseband section, the transceiver employs a 4-bit phase-domain ADC based on novel linear-combiner topology to generate the required phase rotations. The proposed combiner operates in current domain and does not employ resistors, leading to a power- and area-efficient demodulator implementation. The complete receiver achieves a sensitivity of -81.4 dBm and fulfills the BLE requirements on interference blocking. It consumes 1.1 mW from a 1.0-V supply and has a similar power efficiency as recent super-regenerative receivers that are much more susceptible to interferers. The transmitter delivers 1.6-dBm output power to a differential 100 Omega and consumes 5.9 mW, which implies a total efficiency of 24.5%.

Technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, together with location algorithms that include optimization, still require further research for large-scale deployments. This study adopts Bluetooth Low Energy technology and uses the Received Signal strength Indicator (RSSI) from messages as a data source. We then analyse the RSSI from Low Power Nodes, their calculated mean, median and mode values as a basis for further use in an indoor real time location system. Fingerprint databases have been used extensively as a reference to determine location. However, due to the changing indoor environment these may become outdated very quickly. Therefore, this study proposes the use of a Link Quality Indicator as a reference point for further calculation of the location of an asset or a person. The Nordic System on Chip (SOC) is used as the low power node together with a series of Raspberry Pi gateways. Results show that the mean and mode can be used in combination to filter and smooth RSSI values. These calculated RSSI values can then be used and as inputs for an indoor location engine for location determination.

An all-digital PLL employs a digitally controlled oscillator with switching current sources to reduce supply voltage and power without sacrificing its startup margin. It also reduces 1/f noise and supply pushing, thus allowing the ADPLL, after settling, to reduce its sampling rate or shut it off entirely during a direct DCO data modulation. The switching power amplifier integrates its matching network while operating in class-E/F-2 to maximally enhance its efficiency at low voltage. The transmitter is realized in 28 nm digital CMOS and satisfies all metal density and other manufacturing rules. It consumes 3.6 mW/5.5 mW while delivering 0 dBm/3 dBm RF power in Bluetooth Low-Energy mode.

Even though a frequency hopping mechanism is employed by BLE to combat fading and interference in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band, a noticeable probability of collision is expected to arise when the number of communicating BLE devices in the same vicinity increases. In this paper, an analytical model to find the selection probability of each of the 37 BLE data channels is presented. The results, which are confirmed by brute-force simulation, are then used to find the probability of collision between collocated BLE pairs and their maximum achievable aggregate throughput.

The neighbor discovery process (NDP) plays a key role in BLE-enabled IoT services. The basic NDP (B-NDP) specified in BLE specification 4.0 has a limitation in supporting large numbers of BLE devices, owing to its use of three channels. To overcome the limitation of B-NDP, advanced NDP (A-NDP) has been recently introduced in BLE specification 5.0. However, most existing studies have focused on B-NDP, with very few studies having been conducted on A-NDP. In this article, we propose a model for analyzing the effective transmission rate for a BLE advertiser with an A-NDP operation. Using the proposed model, we also propose a performance model to maximize the transmission rate by optimally setting the BLE parameters. The proposed models are validated by comparing with extensive simulation results. It also demonstrates that the maximum transmission rate by the proposed models can be achieved with low energy consumption.

In particular, to allow a direct interaction with objets scattered over a city (e.g, parking slots, light posts, gates) a powerful and scalable architecture has to be envisioned. In this paper, using Bluetooth Low Energy as underlying technology, we extend the concept of Personal Area Networks to include smart city objects so that a user can easily interact with them in a geolocalized and real time manner. A prototype implementing a smart gate has been developed in our University Campus in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

However, the global increase of wireless devices using the crowded spectrum in the 2.4 GHz frequency band can create coexistence issues. This work studies the performance of BLE in environments with multiple BLE devices. An experimental setup consisting of 10 BLE nodes is used to measure BLE application throughput with different connection parameters and under different interference sources, such as other BLE devices and WiFi. The results quantify the decrease of the application throughput and the influence of BLE connection parameters in the experimental settings, as well as suggest parameter values suitable for densely deployed environments.

A Coin-Battery-Powered LDO-Free 2.4-GHz Bluetooth Low-Energy Transmitter With 34.7% Peak System Efficiency	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS			English	Article						Battery capacity usage (BCU); Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); CMOS; direct-coin-battery-powered (DCBP); output power; power amplifier (PA); system efficiency	CMOS; DBM	This brief reports a 2.4-GHz Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transmitter (TX) that can operate against a coin-battery voltage discharging from 1.5 to 1 V, corresponding to a 99.2% battery capacity usage. Specifically, a class-B/C push-pull power amplifier with dual feedback control loops is proposed to dynamically adjust two gate biases, ensuring stable output power and low output HD2. The TX fabricated in 65-nm CMOS occupies a die area of 0.5 mm(2) and achieves three stable power levels: P (out),(H) (2.7 +/- 0.4 dBm) ,P-out,P-M (-0.1 +/- 0.6 dBm), and P-out,P-L (-2.5 +/- 0.8 dBm). At P-out,(H), the system efficiency reaches 34.7%. The 1-Mb/s GFSK output (m = 0.5) and HD(2,3 )comply with the BLE specifications, and the FSK error is 8.2%. A tiny demo board with an antenna, a crystal, and a coin battery (Nanfu LR44) verities the feasibility of the TX over-the-air, achieving 27.5 h of continuous operation for a 1-dB reduction of the received power.

Unlike expensive and complicated commercial telemetry systems with industrial wireless standards, no special data receivers and software are needed. In our validation experiment, six rats were divided into two groups under natural dark and light-dark cycles. For two consecutive weeks, the transmitter mounted on the head of the rat-recorded locomotor activity, skin temperature, and ambient temperature of each rat at a frequency of 6 Hz. After processing with Local Weighted Regression Scatter Smoothing (LOWESS) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) filtering, single cosinor and multi-components cosinor were then used to assess and characterize the circadian rhythm. The results showed that the rhythm values of the two groups of rats coincided with the corresponding light-dark cycle, and that the system was robust to data loss and error from BLE communication failures. Therefore, the proposed system provides a light-weight framework for long-term circadian rhythm monitoring in free-moving rodents to further simplify and promote experimental chronobiology animal studies.

By design, BLE is localized to small regions and to simple network topologies. Moreover, it is not designed for dynamic enforcement of policy and access controls. These limitations are impediments to BLE based IoT service deployment, where IoT devices for a service may need to be grouped into a network slice spanning a sizable geographic region and with strong perslice policy enforcement. This paper presents an architecture for creating wide-area IoT service slices which utilize BLE devices at the edge. For this, we introduce an SDN-controlled "switch node", called BLE service switch (BLESS) that is transparently inserted between two communicating BLE devices. It can be programmed at the service layer by a central controller and enables flexible, policy-based switching between the devices. We describe the design of BLESS, and illustrate its utility through a few practical use cases.	[Uddin, Mostafa; Mukherjee, Sarit; Chang, Hyunseok; Lakshman, T.

An LC tank is used as a load in the proposed buffer to provide a sufficient voltage gain and large voltage swing at the operating frequencies of BLE. Furthermore, the effect of the frequency-dependent impedance of the LC tank on the gain and phase mismatches is reduced by adding compensating transistors. The proposed buffer can provide accurate quadrature signals without additional circuitry in the LO path, minimizing the current consumption of the receiver. It is implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology. It achieved a voltage gain of 5.6 dB, a gain mismatch less than 0.3 dB, a phase mismatch less than 1.1 degrees, and an output P-1dB of 3 dBm. It draws an average current of 3.8 mA from a supply voltage of 0.8 V. The active die area is 0.55 mm(2).

Although, when we have to navigate inside an enclosed space or a building these coordinates do not help in this type of navigation. So, to facilitate Indoor Navigation, there are various techniques used such as Wi-Fi Fingerprinting, Digital Compass Technologies, QR Code, RFID etc. We propose to use BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacons for this Indoor Navigation System (INS) as it is more proficient than all the other technologies in terms of range, accuracy, privacy and security. BLE is a wireless personal area technology designed and marketed by Special Interest Group (SIG) aimed at novel applications in various domains. In this paper, we have implemented an INS using these BLE Beacons which calculate the available shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm finds the shortest path tree from the source by building a set of available destinations that have a minimum distance from the source to the desired destination.

The dataset has been collected by involving 15 volunteers that interacted in indoor environments for a total of 11 hours of activity. The dataset is released as a collection of CSV files with a timestamp, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and a unique identifier of the emitting and of the receiving devices. Volunteers wear a wristband equipped with BLE tags emitting beacons at a fixed rate, and a mobile application able to collect and to store beacons. We organized 6 interaction sessions, designed to reproduce the three common stages of an interaction (Non Interaction, Approaching and Interaction). Moreover, we reproduced interactions by varying the volunteer's posture as well as the position of the receiving device. The dataset is released with a ground truth annotation reporting the exact time intervals during which volunteers actually interacted. The combination of such factors, provides a rich dataset useful to experiment algorithms for detecting interactions and for analyzing dynamics of interactions in a real-world setting. We present in detail the dataset and its evaluation in "Sensing Social Interactions through BLE Beacons and Commercial Mobile Devices", in which we focus on two orthogonal analysis: quality of the dataset and RSSI symmetry of the channel during the interaction stage between pairs of users.

Available in most modern smartphones, it is a popular choice for connecting battery powered devices like sensors or beacons to mobile handsets. A low energy consumption, while being beneficial for all BLE applications, becomes a key requirement for applications containing larger numbers of BLE devices like smart home sensors or beacons in indoor localization due to the high cost of battery replacement. In this paper, we investigate the energy consumption of different BLE System on Chips (SoCs) which provide the foundation to most BLE devices. Based on extensive measurements, we present a vendor-independent model for BLE power consumption which allows energy consumption prediction from key design parameters. This helps in the tradeoff between engergy consumption and BLE performance. We concentrate on advertising mode which governs the energy consumption in popular applications like beacons.

It is supported by most recent consumer mobile devices and can be integrated into sensors enabling them to exchange information in an energy-efficient manner. However, when BLE is used to access or modify sensitive sensor parameters, exchanged messages need to be suitably protected, which may not be possible with the security mechanisms defined in the BLE specification. Consequently we contribute BALSA, a set of cryptographic protocols, a BLE service and a suggested usage architecture aiming to provide a suitable level of security. In this paper we define and analyze these components and describe our proof-of-concept, which demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of BALSA.

This research presents a high accuracy child monitoring system for locating students if they are inside or outside a school bus using the Internet of Things (IoT) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is suitable for a signal strength indication (RSSI) algorithm. The in/out-bus child tracking system alerts a driver to determine if there is a child left on the bus or not. Distance between devices is analyzed for decision making to affiliate the zone of the current children's position. A simplified and high accuracy machine learning of least mean square (LMS) algorithm is used in this research with model-based RSSI localization techniques. The distance is calculated with the grid size of 0.5 m x 0.5 m similar in size to an actual seat of a school bus using two zones (inside or outside a school bus). The averaged signal strength is proposed for this research, rather than using the raw value of the signal strength in typical works, providing a robust position-tracking system with high accuracy while maintaining the simplicity of the classical trilateration method leading to precise classification of each student from each zone. The test was performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking strategy which precisely shows the positions of each student. The proposed method, therefore, can be applied for future autopilot school buses where students' home locations can be securely stored in the system used for references to transport each student to their homes without a driver.

Vendors implement BLE protocols in their manufactured devices compliant to Bluetooth Core Specification. Recently, several vulnerabilities were discovered in the BLE protocol implementations of a few specific products via a manual approach. Considering the diversity and usage of BLE devices as well as the complexity of BLE protocols, we have developed a systematic and comprehensive testing framework, which, as an automated and general-purpose approach, can effectively fuzz any BLE protocol implementation. Our framework runs in a central device and tests a BLE device when the latter gets connected to the central as a peripheral. Our framework incorporates a state machine model of the suite of BLE protocols and monitors the peripheral's state through its responses. With the state machine and current state of the central, our framework either sends malformed packets or normal packets at a wrong time, or both, to the peripheral and awaits an expected response. Anomalous behaviours of the peripheral, e.g., a non-compliant response or unresponsiveness, indicate potential vulnerabilities in its BLE protocol implementation. To maximally expose such anomalies for a BLE device, our framework employs an optimization function to direct the fuzzing process. As of today, we have tested 12 devices from eight vendors and four IoT products, with a total of 11 new vulnerabilities discovered and 13 new Common Vulnerability Exposure (CVE) IDs assigned. We call such a bunch of vulnerabilities as SWEYNTOOTH, which highlights the efficacy of our framework.

This, along with subsequent management of collected data can be a cumbersome activity that requires significant time and effort, from all involved parties. Tracking and managing student attendance during lectures and exams is an especially important instance of that task. Automated attendance management systems devised in the literature differ in applied technological solutions and features. However, many of these lack some features that would make them particularly useful for the task of student attendance management. This paper proposes the design of an automatic system tailored for the tracking and management of student attendance data. The design incorporates three main components that interact to deliver a seamless user experience. The key element is the utilisation of simple beacons, which make the system cost-effective and easy to use. Combining them with a mobile platform and a web service enables versatile attendance tracking. Periodic detection of the nearby beacons with authenticated server-side logic makes the proposed design unique in terms of addressing common attendance tracking issues. Also, the design is open for future integration of sophisticated data analysis modules.

The typical HEMS employs a home server or a gateway to aggregate the energy consumption data, and uses ZigBee, PLC, or WiFi based connection-oriented communications as a data transmission method. The proposed method utilizes the connectionless communication of Bluetooth Low Energy as a data transmission method. Thereby, the proposed method can enhance the energy efficiency of data communication, and make it possible to aggregate the energy consumption data of multiple home appliances simultaneously.

However, changing users behavior (e.g., using a bicycle instead of a car) is not simple. Thus, to promote and motivate cycling we propose Biklio, a cycling rewarding system that, based on the use of a smartphone, detects when a user starts cycling and makes her/him eligible for rewards. This solution uses a smartphone application that includes a bicycle usage detection component. This component is both highly accurate and cheap, while respecting other requirements, and is based on the use of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor, installed on each bicycle, which is detected by smartphones. The system is implemented and running, and the results obtained are very encouraging.

Evaluating Bluetooth Low Energy in Realistic Wireless Environments	2016 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	APR 03-06, 2016	Doha, QATAR	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc				The 2.4 GHz ISM band is crowded with a wide variety of wireless devices operating under various access protocols, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) among them. Low power requirements, low cost, and ease of integration have promoted BLE's rapidly growing popularity. BLE applications range from providing wireless interface for monitoring household equipment status to reporting critical information from medical devices that might have less tolerance for transmission errors to function properly. In this paper, we identify risks in a real world wireless environment that adversely affect BLE system functionality. We also propose a methodology utilizing spectrum surveys to quantify probability of transmission failure relative to the system's interference detection threshold. Spectrum surveys were conducted in a basketball sport facility, a university student union and a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Results demonstrate how a BLE system selects data transmission channels in the presence of interference. Moreover, findings of this study confirm that a BLE system is able to maintain a low probability of failed transmission while operating in the presence of high interference unless the environment noise floor is close to the employed interference detection threshold.

Bluetooth Low Energy is a promising technology that provides, besides ultra-low energy properties, compatibility with most mobile units. However, apart from power efficiency, opportune and reliable information delivery is mandatory in time-critical applications. In this paper we propose an analytical model of the delay performance of Bluetooth Low Energy for connection-oriented applications under different bit error conditions. In addition to the physical over-the-air latency, we also analyze the effect of the occurrence time of an Application Layer event on the effective transmission delay. We highlight the impact of the device's processing speed and the timing configuration of the connection on the final measured latency. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the model for all the analyzed cases.

However, understanding of how people adopt beaconbased location sensing applications is still very limited. We developed a BLE beacon based system for automating class attendance taking. Our first field study with 42 students showed that about 38% of the students adopted it. Students had several misunderstandings and concerns of the technology that challenged its adoption. We revised the design by integrating a participatory sensing approach, where users can manually check in to their class by explicitly sharing their location using GPS.

This solution includes software and sensor hardware installed at each parking space. Because the smartphone is prevalent nowadays, we also design a smartphone application to enable users to easily access information regarding parking spaces near the user's destination and devise the best path to it anytime, anywhere. We choose Apple iOS as the programming platform on the smartphone and Raspberry Pi 3 as the sensor hardware, which uses an infrared distance sensor to determine whether the parking space has been occupied by a vehicle or not. We also adopt Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to connect sensors of all roadside parking lots and build a BLE mesh sensor network to collect parking statuses. A routing protocol for the BLE mesh sensor network to efficiently forward parking information to the parking management server is proposed in this paper. Finally, we present the software and sensor hardware used for implementing this parking management system, the simulator to execute the proposed BLE mesh routing algorithm, and snapshots of the parking app.	[Chang, Ing-Chau; Hsu, Peng-Jun; Lin, Yuan-Sheng; Wu, Yu-Sheng; Chen, Pin-Lin; Lin, Xian-Feng] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, 2 Shida Rd, Changhua 500, Taiwan; [Yen, Chin-En] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Early Childhood Dev & Educ, 168 Jifeng E Rd, Taichung 41349, Taiwan	National Changhua University of Education; Chaoyang University of Technology	Yen, CE (corresponding author), Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Early Childhood Dev & Educ, 168 Jifeng E Rd, Taichung 41349, Taiwan.	icchang@cc.ncue.edu.tw; hsu.pengjun@icloud.com; sam19950810@gmail.com; mouoreo@gmail.com; bulss8516@gmail.com; kevenlove1029@gmail.com; ceyen@cyut.edu.tw			Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [MOST 106-2221-E-018-008-]	Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan	This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan, under Grant Number MOST 106-2221-E-018-008-.		6	4	4	6	31	MYU, SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING DIVISION	TOKYO	1-23-3-303 SENDAGI, TOKYO, 113-0022, JAPAN	0914-4935			SENSOR MATER	Sens.

The latest Bluetooth standards (i.e., Bluetooth 4.x and Bluetooth 5) use the Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which is the mainstream of the current Bluetooth market. In this paper, we present multi-channel backscatter with BLE, a BLE backscatter communication system that achieves compatibility with standard BLE devices. Tag information in backscatter communication can be directly obtained from backscatter packets with a single BLE receiver. We present the first multi-channel backscatter tag design and build a prototype of our tag using an FPGA and evaluate it with BLE devices.

As a power-management capability, whenever there is less data to send, the slave is allowed to remain in a low power mode during a given number of time-slots in a row. However, since the master does not know the exact sleep behavior of the slave, it has to wake-up at every time-slot and repeat its packets until the slave is awake. As a result, applications with variable throughput lead to many energy-consuming idle-slots at the master. In such applications, usually the connection parameters are chosen considering the worst case at design time and remain constant during operation. In this paper, we propose a novel power-management framework for BLE. Rather than skipping slots at the slave side, the proposed system updates the interval between two consecutive time-slots during runtime by applying online algorithms. To avoid data-loss or high delays, the framework guarantees that constraints on latency are met and buffers never overflow. Energy measurements of three different test-cases show that up to 42 percent of the energy consumption of a BLE master can be saved with our power management system.

Smart gadgets like fitness trackers monitor sport exercises and daily movements of the wearer. Sensor data is wirelessly transferred to smartphones and processed by sports and fitness apps. Depending on the application, a single sensor might not be sufficient. In ubiquitous computing, sport science and medicinal appliances, complex scenarios require multiple distributed sensors. However proper sensor data fusion is not possible without precise time synchronization among all units. The common wireless technology of wearables is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is integrated in every nowadays smartphone. But the architecture of BLE makes implementation of accurate time synchronization nearly impossible due to nondeterministic delays. In this paper we present two principles to obtain precise synchronization hardware time stamps, based on the power consumption of BLE System on Chips (SoC). Our concept exceeds the best-known accuracy for BLE and is more energy-efficient compared to related work. Using a common BLE SoC, we achieved a standard deviation of 0.9 microseconds.

In most of the existing routing techniques in wireless networks assumes that all nodes are static and do not change their positions till the end of the network. Although it is not a realistic assumption, it eliminates the effects of mobility of nodes in routing the data. In this paper, we present a mesh network for mobile devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We propose a weight balancing technique to optimize the communication for routing the data using BLE mesh network. We develop a prototype of BLE mesh network using the Android operating system.

For example, it can help detect areas of priority and assign emergency personnel in an efficient manner. However, occupancy detection can be a major challenge in indoor environments. A recent technology that can prove very useful in that respect is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is able to provide the location of a user using information from beacons installed in a building. Here, we evaluate BLE as the primary means of occupancy estimation in an indoor environment, using a prototype system composed of BLE beacons, a mobile application and a server. We employ three machine learning approaches (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression and support vector machines) to determine the presence of occupants inside specific areas of an office space and we evaluate our approach in two independent experimental settings. Our experimental results indicate that combining BLE with machine learning is certainly promising as the basis for occupancy estimation.

We expect everything to be connected regardless of the access technology. However, an important part of the IoT consists of the short-range wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth or ZigBee. These are not directly compatible with TCP/IP and so only usable within their physically bounded Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). We solve this problem with a new application-agnostic approach called Remote Connection Manager (RCM). RCM raises new opportunities to IoT ecosystems enabling transparent remote communication between an application and a (supposedly) short-range device. We implemented an open-source prototype for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to validate our solution and demonstrate the potential of such an original approach.

This paper proposes a novel BLE-based overlay mesh (BOM) that enables the mesh functionality to existing beacon networks without introducing new infrastructure. However, it is an elusive challenge to jointly manage the beaconing and flooding events. To this end, BOM employs 1) best-effort scheduling (BES) to minimize the packet collision rate (PCR) while scheduling the time slots for beaconing events, and 2) received signal strength (RSS)-based bounded flooding (RBF) to maximize the packet delivery ratio (PDR) for the advertising packet while forwarding the relaying packet across the BOM network. Extensive simulations indicate the substantial performance gain of our proposed approach in comparison to the legacy approaches. Specifically, BES reduces the PCR to 66.67%, whereas RBF improves the PDR for the advertising packet to 52% while maintaining approximately the same PDR for the relaying packet. The practical experiment with a real network testbed further demonstrates the feasibility of BOM.

Operating in the 2.36 GHz Medical Body Area Networks (MBANs) and the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific & Medical (ISM) frequency bands, the transceiver implements rotated differential-phase shift keying (DPSK) and Gaussian filtered frequency shift keying (GFSK) modulation for both IEEE 802.15.6 Narrow Band (NB) and Bluetooth Low-Energy (LE) PHY standards. Also included is a proprietary 900 MHz ISM band transmitter utilizing FSK modulation. The wireless transceiver operates half-duplex, and for IEEE 802.15.6 achieves -104/-96.5 dBm receiver input sensitivity (for 10% packet error rate) at data rates of 121.4/971.4 kbps and -94 dBm for Bluetooth LE (for 0.1% bit error rate) at 1 Mbps. Transmit power up to +3/+5 dBm is achievable for IEEE 802.15.6 and Bluetooth LE respectively. The transceiver consumes 4.8 mA during IEEE 802.15.6 & Bluetooth LE receive, and 4.6 mA during Bluetooth LE transmit at -10 dBm output power, from a 1.0 V supply. For IEE802.15.6 transmission at -10 dBm output power, 5.9 mW is consumed, dropping to 1.7mW for proprietary 900 MHz transmission. This performance surpasses state-of-the-art power consumption and represents the first published transceiver for the IEEE 802.15.6 NB PHY standard. It is fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology and occupies approximately 5.9 mm(2).

However, Apple and similarly Android manufacturers have adopted the strategy of MAC address randomization such that their users' privacy would not be compromised in any sort. This paper, pursued the goal of studying the behavior of MAC Address randomization in iOS devices, finding an answer for the following key question: "What does randomized MAC addresses mean for BLE-based Location Tracking and Analytics?" and investigating potential solutions to overcome this challenge and to keep track of all devices at a target venue, while respecting users' privacy. As per our studies, two main approaches are suggested, adopting each will enable Gateways to cope with the MAC address randomization strategies of the iOS devices. The first suggestion is an extension of tracking algorithm, relying on the fact that the frequency of MAC Address randomization is low enough for to keep track of the devices present at the venue, based on the first detected MAC address and its associated device, and the second proposed approach is to incorporate other data fields of the advertised Probe Requests from a target device to enhance localization performance.

However, when a massive number of BLE devices are involved in the NDP, signal collisions become severer, which degrade the NDP performance seriously. To solve the problem, BLE 5.0 specifies some extended features such as advanced NDP (A-NDP). The previous works on the performance models for the NDP have focused on the basic NDP (B-NDP). Though some works considered the performance evaluations on A-NDP, they have done on simulations or testbed-based experiments. Likewise, so far, the performance analysis for A-NDP has been insufficient. In this article, we propose an analytical model to evaluate A-NDP performances, such as the signal collision probability, the discovery delay, the energy consumption, and so on. With the proposed analysis model, the performances of A-NDP are analyzed from the viewpoint of various operational environments for BLE-enabled Internet-of-Things services, and compared to those of B-NDP with extended features of Bluetooth 5.0. Besides, it showed that A-NDP is not always better than B-NDP, and we discuss the operational conditions where A-NDP or B-NDP operate effectively, respectively.

As more and more wearable devices emerge, unauthorized monitoring and tracking by adversary becomes great privacy threats not only in the cyberworld, but also in the physical world. To protect location privacy, this paper presents a real-life location monitoring system that is based on BLE privacy feature that changes the device physical address periodically. To enable users to better control their privacy level while still providing monitoring and tracking service to authorized parties (e.g., for child and elderly care), we extend BLE privacy by enriching its privacy semantics with a comprehensive set of metrics, such as simple opt-in/out, k-anonymity, and granularity-based anonymity. The system has been implemented and evaluated in terms of accuracy and user study.

Common methods utilize Wi-Fi signals. However, most of the Wi-Fi, because it is pre-installed for other purposes, is difficult to fully used for fingerprinting. Bluetooth beacon fingerprinting (BBF) can be used to overcome the drawbacks of the Wi-Fi fingerprinting. With BBF cost reduction is possible, and it also has advantages that can flexibly correspond to the environment variation. This study determines whether it is possible to achieve IPS with implementation of BLE beacon-based fingerprinting. This study presents an optimized fingerprinting method for building a fingerprinting data. In order to increase the accuracy, we applied filtering and probabilistic smoothing technique of fluctuation correction to necessary part of the signal. Result of the study proposes that BLE beacon fingerprinting can be a replacement for Wi-Fi based fingerprinting.

BLE can maintain relatively stable signal strength and has a higher sample rate, which is important for accurate distance determination. On the other hand, RSSI values are not always accurate due to fluctuating signal strength for many reasons, so a designated process and algorithm are used to determine the actual location of the mobile device. In this paper, we propose a BLE plate and Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) combined algorithm that provides a wide range of accuracy and can be applied to indoor positioning for large scale space. The system tested in this study kept positioning errors to within 2.2 m in real environment, and is applicable as an indoor navigation system for very large spaces such as airports and arenas.

Amongst all the viable wireless technologies used in this context, WiFi and Bluetooth are the most widely extended. These technologies are also chosen for their simplicity, low cost and integration into mobile devices. The appearance of the new Bluetooth specification, named Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and the emergence of new popular devices that incorporate it, opens the door to new LPS wireless solutions based on BLE. Here, we evaluate the viability of BLE for indoor positioning scenarios. In addition, we develop a framework to analyse, understand and help migrate previous LPS systems, based on other technologies, to BLE. We show experimentally that, with proper configuration of the BLE devices, great performance can be obtained in terms of discovery time and energy consumption.

The underlying phenomenon is that the off-center BLE antenna and asymmetric radio frequency topology create a characteristic Bluetooth RSSI distribution around the device. By comparing the real-time RSSI readings against a RSSI distribution model, each device can derive the relative position of the other adjacent device. Our experiments using an iPhone and iPad Mini show that Corona yields position estimation at 50% accuracy within a 2cm range, or 85% for the best two candidates. We developed an application to combine Corona with accelerometer readings to mitigate ambiguity and enable cross-device interactions on adjacent devices.

In this paper, we investigated the effect of BLE signal variations on indoor localization caused by the change in BLE transmission power levels. This issue is not often discussed as most of the works on localization algorithms use the highest power levels but has important practical implications for energy efficiency, e.g., if a designer would like to trade-off localization performance and node lifetime. To analyze the impact, we used the established trilateration based localization model with two methods i.e., Centroid Approximation (CA) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). We observed that trilateration based localization with MMSE method outperforms the CA method. We further investigated the use of two filters i.e., Low Pass Filter (LPF) and Kalman Filter (KF) and evaluated their effects in terms of mitigating the random variations from BLE signal. In comparison to non-filter based approach, we observed a great improvement in localization accuracy and localization precision with a filter-based approach. Furthermore, in comparison to LPF based trilateration localization with CA, the performance of a KF based trilateration localization with MMSE is far better. An average of 1 m improvement in localization accuracy and approximately 50% improvement in localization precision is observed by using KF in trilateration based localization model with the MMSE method. In conclusion, with KF in trilateration based localization model with MMSE method effectively eliminates random variations in BLE RSS with multiple transmission power levels and thus results in a BLE based WILS with high accuracy and high precision.

Especially in the field of transport, mobility, and smart solutions, many of these applications require precise localization. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) localization is used mainly because of its availability, reliability, and sufficient precision. However, there are also blind spots in smart cities where the GNSS is not available, e.g., in tunnels. This article presents an approach to fixing the issue of localization in road tunnels based on telecommunications with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based infrastructure equipment. This approach enables us to ensure sufficient data resources for localization, and thus, smart applications can also be applied in the tunnels.

In this paper we present a range-based indoor localization system that exploits the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon packets broadcast by anchor nodes and received by a BLE-enabled device. The method used to infer the user's position is based on stigmergy. We exploit the stigmergic marking process to create an on-line probability map identifying the user's position in the indoor environment.

The system itself is based on a hidden Markov model constructed upon a priorly estimated radio frequency map for the measurement density, and a Gaussian (diffusion) distribution for the transition density. The positions are estimated as the latent variables via particle filter algorithms that are fed with the filtered RSSI data as observations. We first compare the three nonlinear time window filtering techniques, mean, median and maximal filters on the streaming RSSI data captured by the distributed Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors. Seeing the performance boost of the maximal filter strategy with a standard particle filter implementation, we further investigate various model parameters in two particle filter applications: static and adaptive particle filters. The maximal filter preprocessing technique is shown to increase the positioning performance by more than 20% for real-time applications. The performance boost has still space to perform 40% better with better approximation preferences compared to raw RSSI readings.	[Danis, F.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for collecting ECG signals using two wireless wearable modules. The electric potential measured from a sub-module is transferred to the main module through Bluetooth Low Energy, and the collected values are simultaneously displayed in the form of a graph. This study describes the configuration and outcomes of the proposed system and discusses the important challenges associated with the functioning of the device. The proposed system had 84% signal similarity to that of other commercial products. As a band-type module was used on each wrist to check the signal, continuous observation of patients can be achieved without restricting their actions or causing discomfort.

The ability for any device to seamlessly connect and exchange information with smartphones via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol promises unlimited room for innovation. However, it also brings about new privacy challenges. We show that the BLE protocol together with the Bluetooth permission model implemented in the Android and iOS operating systems can be used for cross-app tracking unbeknownst to the individuals. Specifically, through experiments and analyses based on real-world smartphone data we show that by listening to advertising packets broadcasted by nearby BLE-enabled devices and recording information contained in them, app developers can derive fairly unique "fingerprints" for their users, which can be used for cross-app tracking, i.e., linking pseudonymous users of different apps to each other. We demonstrate that privacy protections put in place by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, Google, and Apple are not sufficient to prevent such fingerprinting or to make cross-app tracking difficult to execute. Our main contribution is to demonstrate the feasibility of crossapp tracking using nearby BLE and raise awareness that changes are needed in order to prevent it from becoming widespread. We also propose mitigation strategies to decrease the feasibility of tracking using nearby BLE devices while preserving the utility of the BLE technology.

The features of BLE such as low-cost and low-power dominates it over other technologies such ZigBee, etc. The BLE 4.0 standard provides the in-depth analysis of the BLE architecture. But still many aspects regarding the discovery process of the BLE needs refinement. The performance evaluation of the classical Bluetooth analysis is widely studied, but it cannot apply to the BLE 4.0 standard. Several schemes have been proposed in this regard, but none of them provides the complete discovery process analysis. Therefore, in this paper we provide a complete, new, and an accurate discovery process of BLE standard. The intensive analytical and simulation study provide a basis for the modeling of the BLE discovery process. Moreover, the proposed analysis investigates discovery probability as well as expected discovery latency in a wireless sensor network based on BLE, which are then validated via extensive experiments. We also investigate different parameters which directly affect the performance of the BLE discovery process. The parameters settings are examined, and an optimal setting is also proposed for low-power consumption during the discovery process.

On the Potential of Bluetooth Low Energy Technology for Vehicular Applications	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE			English	Article							WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	With the increasing number of sensors in modern vehicles, using an intra-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN) is a possible solution for the automotive industry for addressing the potential issues that arise from additional wiring harness. Such a solution could help car manufacturers develop vehicles that have better fuel economy and performance, in addition to supporting new applications. However, which wireless technology should be used for maximizing the benefits of IVWSNs is still an open issue. In this article we propose to use a new wireless technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and outline a new architecture for IVWSN. Based on a comprehensive study that encompasses an example application, it is shown that BLE is an excellent option that can be used in IVWSNs for certain applications mainly due to its good performance and low-power, low-complexity, and low-cost attributes.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of these network interfaces and becomes more and more popular because of its energy efficiency and its improved security. The use of random MAC addresses and deep changes in the bluetooth communication procedure were expected to prevent the tracking of individuals through the BLE devices they carries. We reviewed popular devices and found that privacy preserving MAC address are rarely used, even when considering ubiquitous devices that are carried by users all the time. Combined with the new advertising procedure introduced in BLE, this constitute a serious flaw that can be used to track individuals. We investigate its exploitation by BLEB, a BLE Botnet comprise of smartphone and portable devices compromised by a tracking adversary. We investigate the multiple ways to implement it and show that with limited effort, an adversary using BLEB can achieve large scale, high precision and stealthy tracking. A BLEB attack can be more privacy threatening than the ones carried through WiFi or classic bluetooth during their early deployment.

In order to meet the design requirements of wearable mobile medical, this paper uses the main controller to read, filter, and calculate pulse rate and blood oxygen value, and saturate the pulse signal and blood oxygen through the Bluetooth low-power module. The degree value and pulse rate value are transmitted to the Android smartphone, and the APP on the Android phone side manages the user's physiological parameters and establishes a personal health file. Monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in a dynamic environment can be affected by severe motion disturbances. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a new adaptive cancellation algorithm based on adaptive filtering. Based on the interference analysis of the photoelectric volume pulse wave signal in a dynamic environment, this paper uses the envelope information of the PPG (Photoplethysmography) signal to extract the AC component of the photoelectric volume pulse wave signal, and construct interference-related signals as reference signals and perform adaptive filtering to suppress motion interference. The adaptive cancellation algorithm proposed in this paper performs digital signal processing on the collected original information and analyzes the calculation results. Comparing the calculated results with those of the DST (Discrete Saturation Transform) signal extraction technology, the effectiveness of the algorithm in eliminating motion interference is verified, and the anti-interference ability and time complexity of the algorithm under severe motion are verified.

It is based on a type-II phase-tracking loop and addresses the mutual magnetic coupling between on-chip inductors of a digitally controller oscillator (DCO) and low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA), which causes RX performance degradation in the prior-art implementations. An inverter-based inductor-free LNTA is employed instead. The resulting adjacent channel rejection (ACR) improves by 1.5/2.5dB at 2/3MHz offset.

In the proposed I/Q mixer, the current-bleeding circuit, whose main role is to reduce the flicker noise in the switching stage, enhances the overall transconductance and provides quadrature signals with the main quadrature transconductor. Consequently, it improves the conversion gain and noise figure of the mixer without additional power consumption. The proposed BLE receiver front-end consists of a current-reused push-pull low-noise amplifier and an I/Q mixer with a current-reused quadrature transconductor. Simulated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the designed receiver front-end achieves a noise figure of 3.3 dB, conversion gain of 37.6 dB, and input-referred third-order intercept point of -22.73 dBm. It draws a bias current of 1 mA from a nominal supply voltage of 1 V. The active die area is 0.5 mm(2).

Wireless networks are gaining relevance to industrial applications. This entails the necessity of careful performance testing of their capabilities in order to build trust in a communication network prior to and during its deployment in an industrial application. In this paper, a sophisticated approach to performance testing of communication networks from an industrial application's perspective is presented. Following this approach, a performance analysis of a hybrid network of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and PROFINET (PN) is carried out. The deployed measurement tools in the testing system and the system under test (SUT) comprising BLE and PROFINET components are described in detail. The performance tests are conducted in a laboratory using a channel emulator to recreate realistic propagation conditions. The performance testing results reveal significant interdependencies of the three overall system's parts, the application, the PROFINET and BLE networks. A conclusion on how to reduce the mutual impact is drawn.

In this paper, we propose a new BLE-based fingerprinting localization scheme that improves localization accuracy. BLE is a narrow bandwidth communication that is highly affected by frequency selective fading. Frequency selective fading is mainly caused by multipaths between a transmitter and receiver, which are dependent on channels. We utilize channel specific features by separately measure received signal strength (RSS) on different channels to improve localization accuracy. BLE standards provide no API to retrieve channel information of incoming packets. We therefore developed a separate channel advertising scheme to separately measure RSS on different channels. To demonstrate the feasibility of the separate channel fingerprinting, we conducted preliminary experiments as well as initial evaluations. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the separate channel fingerprinting improves localization accuracy by approximately 12%.

To enable adaptive behavior, a robot needs to recognize touch gestures and/or the proximity to interacting individuals. Moreover, a robot interacting with two or more humans usually needs to distinguish between them. However, this remains both a configuration and cost intensive task. In this paper we utilize inexpensive Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and propose an easy and configurable technique to enhance the robot's capabilities to interact with surrounding people. In a noisy laboratory setting, a mobile spherical robot is utilized in three proof-of-concept experiments of the proposed system architecture. Firstly, we enhance the robot with proximity information about the individuals in the surrounding environment. Secondly, we exploit BLE to utilize it as a touch sensor. And lastly, we use BLE to distinguish between interacting individuals. Results show that observing the raw received signal strength (RSS) between BLE devices already enhances the robot's interaction capabilities and that the provided infrastructure can be facilitated to enable adaptive behavior in the future. We show one and the same sensor system can be used to detect different types of information relevant in human- robot interaction (HRI) experiments.

We describe the design, implementation and the test phases of the RE.S.I.STO application, whose goal is to automatically detect the proximity between visitors and artworks. Proximity is detected with a set of algorithms based on the analysis of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. We detail our experimental campaigns which reproduce several museum layouts of increasing complexity at two pilot sites, and we compute the performance of the implemented algorithms to detect the nearby artworks. In particular, we test our solution in a wide open space located in our research institute and by performing a real deployment at the Camposanto Monumentale located in Pisa (Italy). The obtained performance varies in the range of 40% to perfect accuracy, according to the complexity of the considered museum layouts. We also describe a set of stress and stability tests aimed at verifying the robustness of the application during the data collection process. Our results show that the mobile application is able to reduce the beacon loss rate, with an average value of 77% of collected beacons.

J	Pyt, P; Jankowski-Mihulowicz, P; Weglarski, M				Pyt, Patryk; Jankowski-Mihulowicz, Piotr; Weglarski, Mariusz			Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon Powered by the Temperature Difference	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						beacon; Peltier module; energy harvesting; Bluetooth	SENSOR	Bluetooth low energy beacons are active transmitters that send a radio signal at set intervals. Most beacons are powered by small batteries. The problem with systems based on such devices is the need to periodically replace the chemical cells. This is especially tedious when a large number of the beacons is used. The maintenance of such a system causes several serious problems related to the high cost of new batteries and their replacement, time-consuming service and environmental pollution. A solution to these problems is to use beacons with a power supply supported by photovoltaic panels. Their obvious drawback is the need to place them in good lighting conditions. To overcome this disadvantage, the use of a power source that gathers energy due to the Peltier effect is proposed in this paper. Since the temperature difference between two surfaces can be found in almost every environment, the authors analyzed the efficiency of this kind of energy source in the context of powering the beacons. In order to justify the idea, a multitude of measurements and simulations was performed. The power supply demand of the beacon was measured in various modes of operation. The Peltier module was examined at different loads and various temperature differences. On the basis of the gathered data, the energy conditioning system was defined for a given temperature difference sufficient to power the beacon. Finally, the model of the proposed device was developed. The elaborated solution eliminates the need for batteries and makes the beacon maintenance-free.

J	Namie, H; Suzuki, O				Namie, Hiromune; Suzuki, Osamu			Indoor Location Estimation by Bluetooth Low Energy for Pedestrian Navigation	IEEJ JOURNAL OF INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						indoor positioning; BLE; pedestrian navigation		The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a satellite positioning system. However, when the signal is shielded by reinforced concrete or metal, it is difficult to be received indoors. This study introduces an indoor location estimation scheme based on bluetooth low energy (BLE) for pedestrian navigation that can save power and reduce the installation density. We investigated indoor positioning methods with the use of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in association with two BLE transmitters as the main axis. The error of the single RSSI ranging is more than several tens of meters, and is insufficient for use for pedestrian navigation. However, this error is reduced to a few meters when the proposed simple proportional correction calculation is performed for the estimated distance. The target accuracy required for pedestrian navigation for healthy people is approximately 10 m. This is equivalent to the accuracy of outdoor satellite positioning. For example, given that the size of the Shibuya underground shopping street is approximately 4,676m(2), twenty BLE beacons can cover the entire area. If this technology is established, indoor positioning can become possible within a wider range with a lower cost and lower labor effort compared with the current state-of-the-art.

We design a patch-based image encoding algorithm to produce encoded images of reasonably high quality, having sizes of as low as 16 bytes - without any prior knowledge of the test images. We test our system with different types of images that contain hand-written alphanumeric characters, geometric shapes, and arbitrary binary images having complex shapes and curves. We empirically determine the tradeoffs between the system lifetime and the quality of broadcasted images, and determine an optimal set of parameters for our system, under user-specified constraints such as the number of available beacon devices, maximum latency, and life expectancy. We develop a smartphone application that takes an image and user-requirements as inputs, shows previews of different quality output images, writes the encoded image into a set of beacons, and reads the broadcasted image back. Our evaluation shows that a set of 2-3 beacons is capable of broadcasting high-quality images (75%-90% structurally similar to original images) for a year-long continuous broadcasting, and both the lifetime and the image quality improve when more beacons are used.

Typical treatment methods for plantar fasciitis include medications (NSAIDs), exercises, physical therapy, and surgery. Mobile Health (mHealth) technologies stand to improve care for plantar fasciitis via daily monitoring and by addressing barriers to patient adherence with treatment programs. The ability to closely monitor treatment also gives opportunities for curation that were previously unavailable. Pain and inflammation can be decreased by following a simple home exercise routine of stretches specific to the plantar fascia [1]. Our team has developed a system for assistance with monitoring of home exercise program for treatment of plantar fasciitis. The system interfaces Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices with smartphones to send and receive accelerometer and other sensory data, and an accompanying app to be used for at home monitoring and analysis of physical therapy exercises which have been shown to help with plantar fasciitis [2]. Such system can be used to track movement, amplitude, angle, pressure, stretch, and number of repetitions, and overall improve patient adherence to a Home Exercise Program and involvement in treatment. Increased self-monitoring has been shown to directly influence and increase behavior change of patients. In order to increase patient adherence to a prescribed routine, awareness of a behavior and the consistent tracking of its implementation and progress over time are effective [3]. Modern BLE devices are very energy efficient and can work throughout the course of a day, making them an apt choice for a home treatment program. The accompanying app receives, aggregates, and analyzes data from the BLE sensor, and provides actionable feedback to users and clinicians. By increasing patient adherence and speeding up healing, this mHealth system will improve patient outcomes regarding treatment of plantar fasciitis, and also decrease cost of treatment.

Bluetooth specification 4.2 defined only one data rate, i.e., 1 Mb/s. However, the specification 5 released in 2016 specifies 2 Mb/s and coded PHYs for higher throughput and more stable transmission, respectively. This version also allows the transmission power to be varied from -20 dBm to 20 dBm. Therefore we are enabled to use various data rates and transmission powers in BLE. However, no research has studied how to adapt these yet. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, termed AdaptaBLE, that selects data rate and transmission power of BLE by considering link stability and energy consumption. We implement AdaptaBLE on real devices and measure its performance. As a result, we confirm that AdaptaBLE successfully selects an appropriate TX power and data rate while keeping the BLE link stable.

EcoBT Super-node is a full-sized node with an on-board digital accelerometer with rich expansion ports, while EcoBT Mini is the miniature version merely 8x8 mm(2) in area. Included on both nodes are a digital accelerometer with programmable threshold detection for power saving, real-time clock, magnetic switches for contactless operation, and low-load DC-DC converters for low stand-by power when used in conjunction with a rechargeable Lithium-polymer battery. The use of BLE enables direct communication with a BLE-equipped smartphone, tablet, or laptop without the inconvenience of a dongle or an extra gateway device. These two platforms share the identical microcontroller unit (MCU), enabling code sharing between them with little or no porting effort. The versatility of these platforms is being demonstrated in several real-life applications ranging from temperature tracking in shipping containers and lighting control to and several wearable medical devices.

It is based on a commercially available low cost hydro generator. The generator is built into a housing with optimized reduced fluidic resistance to enable operation with flow rates as low as 6 l/min. The power management combines rectification, buffering, defined start-up, and circuit protection. An MSP430FR5949 microcontroller is used for data acquisition and processing. The data are transmitted via RF, using a Bluegiga BLE112 module in advertisement mode, to a PC where the measured flow rate is stored and displayed. The transmission rate of the wireless sensor node (WSN) is set to 1 Hz if enough power is available, which is the case for flow rates above 5.5 l/min. The electronics power demand is calculated to be 340 mu W in average, while the generator is capable of delivering more than 200 mW for flow rates above 15 l/min.

These sensors, with small form factor and low cost, present an advantage for computing three-dimensional space object orientation. Also radio frequency communication (RF) devices are frequently associated with inertial sensors and embedded systems. Radio frequency communication protocols allow immediate data transfer and processing without cumbersome cabling. With special relevance for sports monitoring, gait analysis and general movement assessment inertial sensors have been embedded together to form one device with several sensors. The so called Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), that include an accelerometer, a gyroscope and sometimes may include one magnetometer, are increasingly used, despite their inherent inaccuracy, to determine a body orientation and/or movement profile. These sensors present therefore an advantage for computing three-dimensional space object orientation. The inherent inaccuracy is addressed by using sensor fusion algorithms that increase system reliability. In the work presented in [1], a survey of a number of relevant sensor fusion algorithms was presented. In [2] a Yaskawa Motoman robotic arm is used to implement a set of predefined movements that granted accuracy and repeatability conditions to a framework that is able to test systems that are able to determine a body position. In both [1] and [2], a Bluetooth Low Energy based CC2541 Texas Instruments device has been used to transfer the required data from the IMU sensors to a PC computer running a Windows operating system. This paper presents the BLE proprietary profile that has been implemented to transfer data in wireless mode. Moreover, the paper describes the BLE protocol basics and the relevant options so that implemented systems are low power and fully compatible with the protocol. Also the future use of the developed device is addressed within the context of the Parkinson disease early diagnosis and Canoeing sport monitoring.	[Amaro, J.

However, the Bluetooth range is limited, and a user typically cannot communicate with home Bluetooth devices from outside the home. A technology is therefore proposed that identifies Bluetooth devices in the home and connects with the devices without a communication range limitation. The proposed method is extended to support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A prototype of the extended system was implemented. Based on an experimental evaluation of the prototype system, we confirmed that the proposed technology enables a user to identify remotely located BLE devices through the Internet within an allowable communication delay range.

Such a proximity/non-proximity binary value is used in digital contact tracing applications to reduce the coronavirus disease effects. We proposed two indoor pedestrian localization methods based on contact information using bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons, namely multilateration and cooperative localization. This study attempts to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods using only contact information. Through simulation experiments, we found that the proposed methods can achieve comparable accuracy to existing methods when the attenuation model is accurate. The difference in average localization error was 0.1 m between the proposed method 1 and range-based method, and 0.2 m between the proposed method 2 and fingerprinting method. We confirmed that the proposed methods using only contact information are robust against environmental changes even when the attenuation model is inaccurate. We consider that these contributions have added a new perspective on the use of contact information in the field of indoor localization, which aims to realize power-saving and cost reduction.

Receiver (RX) is implemented with the RF front-end with an inductor-less low-noise transconductance amplifier and 25% duty-cycle current-driven passive mixers, and low-IF baseband analog with a complex Band Pass Filter(BPF). A transmitter (TX) employs an analog phase-locked loop (PLL) with one-point GFSK modulation and class-D digital Power Amplifier (PA) to reduce current consumption. In the analog PLL, low power Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) is designed and the automatic bandwidth calibration is proposed to optimize bandwidth, settling time, and phase noise by adjusting the charge pump current, VCO gain, and resistor and capacitor values of the loop filter. The Analog Digital Converter (ADC) adopts straightforward architecture to reduce current consumption. The DC-DC buck converter operates by automatically selecting an optimum mode among triple modes, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM), and retention, depending on load current. The TRX is implemented using 1P6M 55-nm Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology and the die area is 1.79 mm(2). TRX consumes 5 mW on RX and 6 mW on the TX when PA is 0-dBm. Measured sensitivity of RX is -95 dBm at 2.44 GHz. Efficiency of the DC-DC buck converter is over 89% when the load current is higher than 2.5 mA in the PWM mode. Quiescent current consumption is 400 nA from a supply voltage of 3 V in the retention mode.

J	Joh, H; Ryoo, I				Joh, Hangki; Ryoo, Intae			A hybrid Wi-Fi P2P with bluetooth low energy for optimizing smart device's communication property	PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Smart device; Hybrid Wi-Fi P2P; Quality of service	DISCOVERY	Recently, due to the popularity of smart devices, a need for various types of wireless communication has been tremendously increasing and several types of radio technologies for easy and quick communication with peripherals have appeared. In order for implementing a Personal Area Network (PAN), low power ZigBee and Bluetooth technologies have been generally used. On the other hand, Wi-Fi Local Area Network (LAN) technology has many advantages in implementing a PAN as it's chipset is integrated and it's transmission speed is relatively higher than the others. As the size of multimedia data like photos, videos, and music files has increased, more efficient communication environment for faster connection establishment and higher data transmission speed should be supported for end users accordingly. Because Bluetooth technology has intrincic limitations like transmission speed and coverage, new technologies are expected to provide longer transmission distances and higher transmission rates. Further, if the full functionality of Wi-Fi P2P standard would be implemented for today's smart devices, it would be possible to provide various kinds of mobile innovative services that could maximize user experience. Transmission rate of Bluetooth technology in early stages was only up to 1Mbps. Although this speed is as fast as 6-fold compared to existing techniques, Bluetooth can hardly support a satisfied level of services to transfer large amounts of data such as high quality musics and videos. Therefore, Bluetooth has been used only for specific communication services with limitations. Transmission speed of Bluetooth, however, has been significantly improved as time goes. That is, Bluetooth 2.0 released in 2004 supports maximum speed of 3Mbps, and Bluetooth 3.0 released in 2 009 supports up to 24Mbps. Bluetooth 4.0 released in 2 010 has low energy mode while maintaing 24Mbps and also supports coin cell with low power consumptioin. Wi-Fi P2P is a direct communication technology between terminals without any intermediate devices such as routers and access point (AP). Wi-Fi module is basically mounted on most of smart devices. Therefore, once Wi-Fi P2P technology is adapted to mobile terminals or mobile devices such as TV, laptop, printer, and camera, all the communication services and multimedia contents can be simply provided for these devices by using the Wi-Fi P2P. In this study, we have proposed a cross-layer system design for optimizing smart devices' communication property by utilizing the characteristics of high-speed data transmission rate of Wi-Fi P2P and low power consumption communication of Bluetooth. We have also verified that the proposed technique outperforms the existing Bluetooth and Wi-Fi P2P in the comparison of throughput as well as transmission delay through OPNET simulations, which leads to faster user connections and provides better quality of services to end users.

In BLE-based fingerprint positioning, accuracy and delay have always been huge challenges and are both closely related to the sampling time of each position estimate (the window size). In this paper, we analyze how the window size affects the positioning accuracy and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of localization using the received signal strength (RSS). Based on the relation between the window size and the standard deviation of the average RSSs between windows, an enhanced CRLB model is proposed by rewriting the parameters in the existing CRLB model to make it related to the window size. The proposed CRLB model related to window size is verified in two indoor scenarios with different typologies for the beacons and different packet transmission frequency. The enhanced CRLB model provides a theoretical basis for analyzing the relation between delay and accuracy and provides a reference for the decision about the window size in the positioning process. In addition, based on the enhanced CRLB model and our analysis, a scheme for generating a robust fingerprint vector is proposed for RSS instability and uncaught beacons' RSSs caused by the reduced window size. Because with a small number of samples it is difficult to smooth the fluctuation of the RSS, a low complexity weighted fingerprint construction (WFC) method is proposed. WFC uses the weighted average of the RSS data in the previous window fingerprint vector and the samples in the current window to generate the fingerprint vector of the current window. This weight is scaled by a limit factor related to their difference. The uncaught beacons' RSSs are estimated by referring to the fingerprints in the fingerprints database at the previous location. In the one-site test, the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used as the classifier. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional mean fingerprint vector by about 24.5% in terms of positioning accuracy under low latency (the window size is 0.5 s).

J	Antonioli, D; Tippenhauer, NO; Rasmussen, K				Antonioli, Daniele; Tippenhauer, Nils Ole; Rasmussen, Kasper			Key Negotiation Downgrade Attacks on Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PRIVACY AND SECURITY			English	Article						Security; bluetooth; BLE; key negotiation; downgrade attack; KNOB attack		Bluetooth (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are pervasive wireless technologies specified in the Bluetooth standard. The standard includes key negotiation protocols used to generate long-term keys (during pairing) and session keys (during secure connection establishment). In this work, we demonstrate that the key negotiation protocols of Bluetooth and BLE are vulnerable to standard-compliant entropy downgrade attacks. In particular, we show how an attacker can downgrade the entropy of any Bluetooth session key to 1 byte, and of any BLE long-term key and session key to 7 bytes. Such low entropy values enable the attacker to brute-force Bluetooth long-term keys and BLE long-term and session keys, and to break all the security guarantees promised by Bluetooth and BLE. As a result of our attacks, an attacker can decrypt all the ciphertext and inject valid ciphertext in any Bluetooth and BLE network. Our key negotiation downgrade attacks are conducted remotely, do not require access to the victims' devices, and are stealthy to the victims. As the attacks are standard-compliant, they are effective regardless of the usage of the strongest Bluetooth and BLE security modes (including Secure Connections), the Bluetooth version, and the implementation details of the devices used by the victims. We successfully attack 38 Bluetooth devices (32 unique Bluetooth chips) and 19 BLE devices from different vendors, using all the major versions of the Bluetooth standard. Finally, we present effective legacy compliant and non-legacy compliant countermeasures to mitigate our key negotiation downgrade attacks.

A BLE beacon can supply information that is related to location. This information is used for many purposes such as e-learning and commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a new style of outdoor studying as a collaboration between outdoor studying and the local economy. Shops in the area supply students with vivid and seasonal information about the area. Over three years of research, we found our application caused students to remember the cultural sites. We also found that they came to value the area. Shop owners hence hope to benefit from this application. However, we also found some tendencies in students' feelings about traveling in this process. This paper describes the results of our research from 2014 to 2016 using BLE beacons in Nikko. We describe several different scenarios using beacons and their results.

The algorithm integrates an Off-set triangulation algorithm and a multi-stage weighted framework. An off-set triangulation algorithm was used to provide a general method to locate the user's position. Results are integrated into a weighted framework in order to increase the adaptability of the proposed localization algorithm to different complex environments and increase the accuracy of the localization. Three experiments in different environments have been examined in order to test the performance and the limitations of this algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm demonstrated strong adaptability to complex non-Line-of-Sight (LOS) environments.

However, it is difficult to obtain this data, as there are currently no tools or methods. In this work we present a novel acquisition method, using BLE to collect records stored on smart Blood Pressure Monitors (BPM).

This technology makes it possible for a large number of devices to be connected to the Internet of Things. The BLE mechanism is clearly defined by the standard, however, there is room for improvements in some aspects of the technology such as the discovery process. Although the discovery process of traditional Bluetooth architecture has been intensively investigated through analytical and simulation models over the years, it cannot be applied to the BLE technology because of many changes introduced in the design of the BLE. Recently, there have been several works for performance evaluation of BLE discovery process, but they are not still thorough enough in providing a holistic analysis of the BLE. This has motivated our study for more accurate modeling of the BLE discovery process. Our work focuses on developing an analytical model and carrying out intensive simulations to investigate discovery probability and quantitative examination of the influence of parameter settings on the discovery latency and the energy performance metric of the discovery process.

J	Maneerat, K; Kaemarungsi, K				Maneerat, Kriangkrai; Kaemarungsi, Kamol			Performance Improvement Design of Bluetooth Low Energy-Based Wireless Indoor Positioning Systems	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								The systematic design of wireless indoor positioning systems can offer another essential approach to achieving the required performance objectives aside from using suitable location determination algorithms. This manuscript investigates Bluetooth Low Energy- (BLE-) based wireless indoor positioning systems and how adjusting the system design parameters can affect their location determination performance. Without placing emphasis on sophisticated location determination algorithms, this work provides guidelines for how a system designer can control the balance among multiple positioning performance metrics. For example, a balance between the number of installed reference nodes and the accuracy performance can be chosen to control deployment costs, such as the installation expense, infrastructure expense, and installation time. To demonstrate our baseline study, we compare three different designs of BLE wireless indoor positioning system that utilize location determination algorithms based on proximity, trilateration, and scene analysis. These designs are also compared over two different building sizes, which are medium and large. The design model and performance analysis data were based on our actual implementation of the hardware and software system for a BLE wireless indoor positioning system. Specifically, the received signal strength indication data were collected from our prototype reference nodes. The findings from our study indicated that a proximity-based system can only provide fair location accuracy performance (average error distance of 5 m to 7 m) making it unsuitable for applications that require high accuracy. For medium location accuracy performance (average error distance of 3 m to 5 m), the trilateration-based system can achieve the highest efficiency in terms of number of installed reference nodes over the accuracy. The trilateration-based system can reduce the number of installed reference nodes by 154% to achieve the same level of accuracy as the scene analysis-based system. For good location accuracy performance (average error distance <= 3 m), the scene analysis-based system yields the highest scalability performance in terms of installed reference nodes. The scene analysis-based system can reduce the number of reference nodes by 40% and 113% to achieve the same accuracy performance when compared with trilateration and proximity-based systems, respectively. Finally, the validation results from the actual installation of Bluetooth-based indoor positioning systems confirmed that our proposed framework can help the system designers to achieve the required performance goal.

Early experimentation demonstrated that the low bandwidth of BLE signals compared to WiFi is the cause of significant measurement error when coupled with the use of three BLE advertising channels. The physics underlying this behaviour is verified in simulation. A multipath mitigation scheme is proposed and tested. It is determined that the optimal positioning performance is provided by 10Hz beaconing and a 1 second multipath mitigation processing window size. It is determined that a steady increase in positioning performance with fingerprint size occurs up to 7 +/- 1, above this there is no clear benefit to extra beacon coverage.

Blind spot accidents are a frequently occurring problem. Annually, dozens of deaths are caused by this phenomenon despite legally compulsory prevention tools and large investments in raising awareness and developing prevention systems. Because this is not enough to reduce the number of accidents, proactive solutions must be found. This article describes the evaluation of a new blind spot system based on BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In this paper, a complete system is designed with on-the-shelf products and finally realized in a proof-of-concept. The final design requirements are fixed, by figuring out where the blind spots are and which various advantages and disadvantages the existing systems have. In a further stage, the system is tested in several possible critical situations, proving that it is very robust. Vulnerable road users are indeed detected by visualization on the LCD display.

In this work, IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocols are evaluated with respect to service ratio, delay, and energy efficiency under IPv6 traffic. While the performance is terms of delay is similar between the two technologies, BLE outperforms 802.15.4 in terms of service ratio and energy efficiency. Header compression increases all performance indicators but requires a shared context to be set up and managed. IPv6 multicast is also investigated in combination with data link layer broadcast and sequential unicast. Finally, the impact of IPv6 connection establishment and maintenance is evaluated. This is particularly relevant for BLE devices using privacy features.

The usage of signal propagation models for indoor localization requires calibration phase because the path loss model parameters take into account multipath propagation, shadowing and fading influences. This phase of such indoor localization technique using signal propagation model can be eliminated by automated procedure of parameter calibration. For this objective Bluetooth Low Energy beacon proximity zones and smartphone built-in sensors can be used.

However, there are still plenty of challenges related to this technology, especially in terms of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fluctuations due to the behaviour of the channels and the multipath effect, that lead to poor precision. In order to mitigate these effects, in this paper we propose and implement a real Indoor Positioning System based on Bluetooth Low Energy, that improves accuracy while reducing power consumption and costs. The three main proposals are: frequency diversity, Kalman filtering and a trilateration method what we have denominated "weighted trilateration". The analysis of the results proves that all the proposals improve the precision of the system, which goes up to 1.82 m 90% of the time for a device moving in a middle-size room and 0.7 m for static devices. Furthermore, we have proved that the system is scalable and efficient in terms of cost and power consumption. The implemented approach allows using a very simple device (like a SensorTag) on the items to locate. The system enables a very low density of anchor points or references and with a precision better than existing solutions.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses the combination of channel-separate polynomial regression model (PRM), channel-separate fingerprinting (FP), outlier detection and extended Kalman filtering (EKF) for smartphone-based indoor localization with BLE beacons. The proposed algorithm uses FP and PRM to estimate the target's location and the distances between the target and BLE beacons respectively. We compare the performance of distance estimation that uses separate PRM for three advertisement channels (i.e., the separate strategy) with that use an aggregate PRM generated through the combination of information from all channels (i.e., the aggregate strategy). The performance of FP-based location estimation results of the separate strategy and the aggregate strategy are also compared. It was found that the separate strategy can provide higher accuracy; thus, it is preferred to adopt PRM and FP for each BLE advertisement channel separately. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the algorithm, a two-level outlier detection mechanism is designed. Distance and location estimates obtained from PRM and FP are passed to the first outlier detection to generate improved distance estimates for the EKF. After the EKF process, the second outlier detection algorithm based on statistical testing is further performed to remove the outliers. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by various field experiments. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieved the accuracy of <2.56 m at 90% of the time with dense deployment of BLE beacons (1 beacon per 9 m), which performs 35.82% better than <3.99 m from the Propagation Model (PM) + EKF algorithm and 15.77% more accurate than <3.04 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. With sparse deployment (1 beacon per 18 m), the proposed algorithm achieves the accuracies of <3.88 m at 90% of the time, which performs 49.58% more accurate than <8.00 m from the PM + EKF algorithm and 21.41% better than <4.94 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is especially useful to improve the localization accuracy in environments with sparse beacon deployment.

However, the BLE specification does not require the SCO mode for the initiator, and does not specify how the BLE programming framework should implement this mode. In this paper we show that the BLE programming framework of the initiator must properly handle SCO initiation, status management, error handling, and bond management; otherwise severe flaws can be exploited to perform downgrade attacks, forcing the BLE pairing protocols to run in an insecure mode without user's awareness. To validate our findings, we have tested 18 popular BLE commercial products with 5 Android phones. Our experimental results proved that MITM attacks (caused by downgrading) are possible to all these products. More importantly, due to such system flaws from the BLE programming framework, all BLE apps in Android are subject to our downgrade attacks. To defend against our attacks, we have built a prototype for the SCO mode on Android 8 atop Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Finally, in addition to Android, we also find all major OSes including iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux do not support the SCO mode properly. We have reported the identified BLE pairing vulnerabilities to Bluetooth Special Interest Group, Google, Apple, Texas Instruments, and Microsoft.

The proposed method combines Wi-Fi fingerprinting and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) trilateration positioning methods. Firstly, the Wi-Fi fingerprinting method estimates the rough position of asset in a large building, provided by mobile device user. Then, when the user approaches the asset, the exact position of asset is estimated by the BLE trilateration method. The experimental result showed that the BLE trilateration positioning achieved 90% accuracy within 1.21 m. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively assist users to locate and track assets in a large building.

As a promising radio, BT LE realizes many designing features to fulfill foreseeable requirements of short range communication, such as fast device discovery, power-saving transmitting, encryption and authentication, etc. In this paper, we focus on the modeling and performance analyzing of the device discovery process in BT LE networks. A general model for device discovery on multi-channel is proposed primarily, which is then tailored and simplified for the BT LE case, where three broadcasting channels are used. Via theoretical analysis, our study reveals that some potential pitfalls are residing in the current version of BT LE specification, i.e. improper parameter settings can significantly deteriorate the device discovery latency and increase meaningless energy consumption. We accordingly propose several strategies seeking ways to tackle the problem. The results of extensive simulation show that our strategies can largely reduce undesirable latency and effectively improve the efficiency of device discovery in BT LE networks.

The vehicle detection and classification tasks are performed by analyzing strength of a radio signal received from Bluetooth Low Energy beacons with the use of machine learning algorithms. The introduced system is cost-efficient, easy to install, and can be used for a long time without an external power source. An energy-aware algorithm is proposed, which uses a scheduling mechanism to manage wireless nodes that can act as BLE beacons (in low energy mode) or receivers. Results of experimental evaluation confirm that the proposed solution enables collection of accurate traffic data in real time and prolongs lifetime of battery-powered wireless nodes in the traffic monitoring system.

In day care center, caretakers are taking care records aiming to improve care receiver's Quality of Life. However, in the present situation, it's difficult for caretakers to record care receiver's activity in detail because each care worker needs to take care of several care receivers at the same time and it is a large burden. To reduce the burden of caretakers, many elderly monitoring systems have been proposed so far, but most of them are not effective in the sense that they force care receivers to use dedicated device such as smart phone and/or particular applications that are obtrusive and cumbersome for care receivers. In this paper, we propose a novel elderly monitoring system which can monitor movements/activity of multiple care receivers at the same time by estimating existence area of each of the care receivers, without burdening them. Our proposed system estimates multiple care receivers existence area only using RSSI of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The feature of our proposed system is that it takes Movable-Beacon and Fixed Scanner style. We have validated the proposed system and confirmed that we can estimate multi-person's existence area at high accuracy using only BLE devices.

The proposed quadrature LNA consists of a common-source (CS) amplifier with inductive degeneration, an active-type poly-phase filter (PPF), and an LC tank. The proposed active-type PPF between the CS amplifier and the LC tank provides quadrature generation, and the CS amplifier determines and optimizes the overall LNA performance parameters. Moreover, the proposed active-type PPF shares the dc bias current with the CS amplifier, thereby eliminating the necessity for additional current consumption. The implemented BLE receiver is composed of the quadrature LNA, a G(m)-stage, a double-balanced current-mode passive mixer, a transimpedance amplifier, and an active-RC complex bandpass filter. The proposed design was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process and mainly characterized in the BLE operating frequency bands. The receiver achieves a noise figure of 8.2 dB, a conversion gain of 49.5 dB, an image rejection ratio of more than 33 dB, and an IIP3 of -25.75 dBm. The active die area of the implemented receiver is 1.16 mm(2), and it draws a bias current of 2.7 mA from a nominal supply voltage of 0.8 V.

Analysis and Design of an Ultra-Low-Power Bluetooth Low-Energy Transmitter With Ring Oscillator-Based ADPLL and 4x Frequency Edge Combiner	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						All-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); Internet of Things (IoT); phase noise (PN); ring oscillator (RO); switch-capacitor digital power amplifier (SCDPA); transmitter; ultra-low-power (ULP)	PHASE NOISE; TRANSCEIVER; JITTER; CMOS	In this paper, we present an all-digital ring oscillator (RO)-based Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transmitter (TX) for ultra-low-power radios in short range Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The power consumption of state-of-the-art BLE TXs has been limited by the relatively power-hungry local oscillator (LO) due to the use of LC oscillators for superior phase noise (PN) performance. This paper addresses this issue by analyzing the PN limit of a BLE TX and proposes an RO-based solution for power and cost savings. The proposed transmitter features: 1) a wideband all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) featuring an fRF/4 RO, with an embedded 5-bit TDC; 2) a 4x frequency edge combiner to generate the 2.4-GHz signal; and 3) a switch-capacitor digital PA optimized for high efficiency at low transmit power levels. These not only help reduce the power consumption and improve PN performance but also enhance the TX efficiency for short range applications. The TX is prototyped in 40-nm CMOS, occupies an active area of 0.0166 mm(2), and consumes 486 mu W in its low-power mode, while configured as a non-connectable advertiser. The TX has been validated by wirelessly communicating beacon messages to a mobile phone.

In the framework of autonomous UAV missions, precise feedback on real-time aircraft position is very important. For outdoor operations, conventional positioning methods are based on GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and/or IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors. There are different technologies alternative to GNSS-based approaches for UAV positioning in indoor navigation. They are based on onboard sensor integration, e.g., camera, radar, sonar, LiDAR, Inertial Navigation System (INS), Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) devices. In this paper we propose, as a preliminary stage, a low-cost Indoor Positioning System (IPS) for UAVs, based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, by exploiting the RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Indicator). BLE is a low power consumption technology aimed at transmitting small amounts of data. A mathematical model is established to analyze the relation between the RSSI and the distance from two or three Bluetooth devices, an onboard receiver (Arduino Nano 33 BLE, used as Single-Board Computer (SBC)) and transmitters positioned in the indoor operating field (BLE beacons). Position estimation is achieved by trilateration, and 1-D Kalman filtering is applied to correct data from noise, drift, and bias errors. Experimental results and system performance analysis show the feasibility of this methodology. Future developments will involve outdoor tests for a safe landing area determination system developed by the authors.

Using the received signal strength (RSS) of a BLE signal and the uniqueness of BLE hardware addresses, mobile subjects can be identified and localized within the hospital room. The RSS measurement of the BLE signal from a wearable BLE beacon varies with distance to the wall-anchored BLE scanner. In order to understand and demonstrate the practicality of the relationship between RSS of a BLE beacon and the distance of a beacon from a scanner, the first part of the paper presents the analysis of the experiments conducted in a low-noise and nonreflective environment. Based on the analysis conducted in an ideal environment, the second half of the paper proposes a data-driven localization process for pinpointing the movements of the subject within the experimental room. In order to ensure higher accuracy like fingerprinting techniques and handle the increased number of BLE-anchored scanners like geometric techniques, the proposed algorithm was designed to combine the best aspects of these two techniques for better localization. The paper evaluates the effects of the number of BLE wall-mounted scanners and the number of packets on the performance of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm locates the patient within the room with error less than 1.8m. It also performs better than other classical approaches used in localization.

This system can be used by a robot to coarsely localize objects in retrieval tasks. We attach small Bluetooth low energy tags to objects and require at least four static Bluetooth receivers. While commodity Bluetooth devices could be used, we have built low-cost receivers from Raspberry Pi computers. The location of a tag is estimated by lateration of its received signal strengths. In experiments, we evaluate accuracy and timing of our approach, and report on the successful demonstration at the RoboCup German Open 2014 competition in Magdeburg.

J	Sidibe, A; Loubet, G; Takacs, A; Dragomirescu, D				Sidibe, Alassane; Loubet, Gael; Takacs, Alexandru; Dragomirescu, Daniela			A Multifunctional Battery-Free Bluetooth Low Energy Wireless Sensor Node Remotely Powered by Electromagnetic Wireless Power Transfer in Far-Field	SENSORS			English	Article						wireless power transmission (WPT); wireless communications; wireless sensor node; Bluetooth low energy (BLE); Internet of Things (IoT); power management unit (PMU); structural health monitoring (SHM)		This paper presents a multifunctional battery-free wireless sensing node (SN) designed to monitor physical parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity and resistivity) of reinforced concrete. The SN, which is intended to be embedded into a concrete cavity, is autonomous and can be wirelessly powered thanks to the wireless power transmission technique. Once enough energy is stored in a capacitor, the active components (sensor and transceiver) are supplied with the harvested power. The data from the sensor are then wirelessly transmitted via the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in broadcasting mode to a device configured as an observer. The feature of energy harvesting (EH) is achieved thanks to an RF-to-DC converter (a rectifier) optimized for a low power input level. It is based on a voltage doubler topology with SMS7630-005LF Schottky diode optimized at -15 dBm input power and a load of 10 k ohm. The harvested DC power is then managed and boosted by a power management unit (PMU). The proposed system has the advantage of presenting two different power management units (PMUs) and two rectifiers working in different European Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency bands (868 MHz and 2.45 GHz) depending on the available power density. The PMU interfaces a storage capacitor to store the harvested power and then power the active components of the sensing node. The low power digital sensor HD2080 is selected to provide accurate humidity and temperature measurements. Resistivity measurement (not reported in this paper) can also be achieved through a current injection on the concrete probes. For wireless communications, the QN9080 system-on-chip (SoC) was chosen as a BLE transceiver thanks to its attractive features: a small package size and extremely low power consumption. For low power consumption, the SN is configured in broadcasting mode. The measured power consumption of the SN in a deep-sleep mode is 946 mu J for four advertising events (spaced at 250 ms maximum) after the functioning of sensors. It also includes voltage offset cancelling functionality for resistivity measurement. Far-field measurement operated in an anechoic chamber with the most efficient PMU (AEM30940) gives a first charging time of 48 s (with an empty capacitor) and recharge duration of 27 s for a complete measurement and data transmission cycle.

This is achieved through the use of efficient mixers with improved out-of-band suppression, including rejection of the second harmonic, and an local-oscillator generator achieving current reuse and rejection of voltage-controlled oscillator signal imbalance through the use of complementary devices. Manufactured in 65 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor and with a power consumption below 550 mu W from a 0.85 V supply, the front-end achieves a conversion gain of 41 dB and a noise figure of 9.6 dB.

Passive or active components are embedded in printed-circuit-board (PCB) as called as System-on-Package (SoP). A proposed module is composed of a BLE IC, a memory, a 3-axis sensor, a crystal, inductors, capacitors, and resistors. In side view, ICs and a PCB with passive components are sequentially located from top and bottom. Capacitors, inductors and resistors are embedded in PCB. In order to check the performance and size for embedded modules, two representative modules for BLE with SMT and with SoP are designed and compared. The size of module with SMT and SoP are as 11 mm x 8 mm and 6 mm x 8 mm, respectively. Almost 44.5 % size reduction is obtained by SoP. Measured Tx power in Bluetooth are given as -2.0 dBm and BLE has good performance. This paper presented that SoP technology was better than SMT technology in a view of size. Implemented module had good performance and slim size.

Despite the tight relation with the main radio functions, it is usually implemented with separate hardware, firmware, and it is far from being integrated in the most diffused standard wireless protocols for sensors networks and for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we want to check in-deep the coexistence between the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is one of the most used low-power short-range wireless standards for mobile and wearable communication, and a wake-up facility implemented in the same band. We focus on the analysis of the limits, advantages and drawbacks of adding this interesting feature in the BLE standard, and we discuss about the improvements in terms of power saving and latency of the communication. We target IoT applications and scenarios with a high density of BLE devices, analyzing the standard protocol and how WuRs can enhance its performance. Two common communication schemes will help us to show the limits and to define a design methodology for the application. Simulation results will show the trade-offs of the communication performance and the difference from a normal usage of the BLE. Finally, considerations about the usability of BLE with WuRs and guidelines will be provided as concluding remarks.

J	Nikodem, M; Slabicki, M; Bawiec, M				Nikodem, Maciej; Slabicki, Mariusz; Bawiec, Marek			Efficient Communication Scheme for Bluetooth Low Energy in Large Scale Applications	SENSORS			English	Article						BLE; advertisement; opportunistic sensing; real-life evaluation; simulations; active scanning; intermittent operation; energy efficiency	BLE	The use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications has become widespread and popular. This has resulted in the increased number of deployed BLE devices. To ensure energy efficiency, applications use connectionless communication where nodes broadcast information using advertisement messages. As the BLE devices compete for access to spectrum, collisions are inevitable and methods that improve device coexistence are required. This paper proposes a connectionless communication scheme for BLE that improves communication efficiency in IoT applications where a large number of BLE nodes operate in the same area and communicate simultaneously to a central server. The proposed scheme is based on an active scanning mode and is compared with a typical application where passive scanning mode is used. The evaluation is based on numerical simulations and real-life evaluation of a network containing 150 devices. The presented scheme significantly reduces the number of messages transmitted by each node and decreases packet loss ratio. It also improves the energy efficiency and preserves the battery of BLE nodes as they transmit fewer radio messages and effectively spent less time actively communicating. The proposed connectionless BLE communication scheme can be applied to a large variety of IoT applications improving their performance and coexistence with other devices operating in the 2.4 GHz band. Additionally, the implementation complexity and costs of the proposed communication scheme are negligible.

The system design provides the user with the Internet of Things (IoT) proof-of-concept (PoC) for indoor locating based systems using Bluetooth connectivity topology. Furthermore, the performance of the system is evaluated in term of signal speed, energy consumption, and sufficient distance of deploying both transmitter and receiver. For the system development, ESP32 WiFi and BLE supported modules are used as the front-end support devices to receive nearby reporting Bluetooth Beacons signal, while a local computer runs as backend computing server to allow trilateration processing based on the reported Bluetooth RSSI values. MQTT that support IoT technology is installed on the local computer with web socket enable-feature allows the plugin to run on the internet browser. Besides that, React Application is used to create user interface on the internet browser which converts the received raw RSSI data into an animated reactive web interface. Using this IoT application, users can monitor or track the current location of the reported Bluetooth signal devices. In summary, the ILS is capable of showing the tracking device using a 2D map on the browser. Hence, it can save consumers time and effectively useful.	[Goh, B. S.; Mahamad, A.

It also reduces 1/f noise allowing the ADPLL, after settling, to reduce its sampling rate or shut it off entirely during direct DCO data modulation. The switching power amplifier integrates its matching network while operating in class-E/F-2 to maximally enhance its efficiency.

We demonstrate that by inferring wireless signals, we can keep a track of localization that can provide key performance indicators in maintaining a healthy and active life of elderlies. As WiFi and BLE operate at multiple transmission power levels, the localization accuracy can vary. In this regard, we investigate the feasibility of the WiFi and BLE wireless signals in tracking the location of an elderly in a cluttered home environment. We use fingerprinting localization algorithm for location estimation. We first demonstrate that both wireless standards can be used for indoor localization. We further present the results for localization estimated from multiple transmission power levels for WiFi and BLE. The results show WiFi signals to be more stable compared to BLE signals. However, despite operating at much low transmission power levels BLE provides comparable results that are sufficient for locating elderlies in an indoor environment.

Although recent versions of BLE embrace the 6LoWPAN standard for IPv6 low-power device communication, this is often not the best choice for constrained-node networks due to downsides such as increased memory and computation overhead, heavier network stack, increased power consumption, backward incompatibility, etc. A crucial requirement for successful IoT solutions is an efficient strategy for monitoring and control of highly distributed sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and lightweight model for management of distributed constrained BLE nodes based on OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol. To this end, we have designed a new intermediate component, a BLE-LWM2M gateway (GW), which has dual roles: a BLE master that monitors and controls the BLE devices, and a LWM2M client that acts on behalf of an operator's LWM2M management server. The BLE-LWM2M GW has interfaces to dynamically manage connected BLE devices as LWM2M objects, called ObjectTwins, in runtime without a need for user configuration. All services that BLE devices provide are mapped to the ObjectTwins in the gateway, which are exposed to the LWM2M server. Hence, this model enables a LWM2M server to manage distributed BLE devices by interacting with the BLE-LWM2M GW using the LWM2M standard methods, and the constrained devices can still use a native Bluetooth communication protocol. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of a mobile healthcare system has been implemented in a testbed.

Although there are different technologies that can be used for localization, there are many limitations that need to be improved, and therefore there is a need to explore new technologies and alternatives that can improve indoor localization. It has been proven that visible light can be used to transfer data. A German physicist, Harald Haas, introduced the term "Li-Fi", which stands for "light fidelity", as a new technology that uses light as a medium to deliver data. Accordingly, in this study, we have proposed a hybrid asset localization system using Li-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This system utilizes light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and BLE tags to detect the locations of assets in a smart building with the support of crowdsourcing technology. The system can make the management, maintenance, and localization process of equipment inside the buildings more easier. To achieve the required, the paper provides a comparison between different applications that have been developed for indoor localization using Li-Fi technology in order to highlight the limitations that need more improvement. The proposed system consists of a web-based administrator panel that allows the administrator to manage maps, assets, tags, LED lamps, and maintenance requests, as well as a mobile application that enables the user to locate, search and view asset information. In addition, the mobile application performs the process of crowdsourcing to update the assets' locations. We experimentally explore the system's functionalities and the results show that the system can accurately localize assets, and can detect Li-Fi signals from 55 lx and above within a range of 1.5 m. In addition, the BLE stickers can be detected up to 7 meters away, however, the crowdsourcing process to update the asset location is performed if the distance between the mobile application and the asset is less than or equal 1 m which gives accurate results.

In particular, the introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons has been a major catalyst for much of the recent interest in IPS. This paper focuses on the implementation and development of a simple IPS Android application using BLE beacons and the application of Kalman filtering for improved accuracy. The IPS Android application uses the filtered received signal strength indication (RSSI) to approximate the location of an Android device as it moves throughout a location that has been outfitted with BLE beacons. The location data that is generated by the application is sent to a database to allow for previous location history to be examined and to enable to application to watch the movements of tracked devices in real time.

However, the indoor positioning accuracy always suffers from non-line of sight (NLOS) propagation, stemming from the frequently occurring instances of reflection, refraction, or scattering of BLE radio signals due to the complexity of indoor environments. This article proposes an integrity monitoring (IM) algorithm to detect and eliminate two gross errors simultaneously to solve the adverse effects caused by the NLOS. The logarithmic attenuation model based on the received signal strength indication (RSSI) of BLE realizes positioning by combining trilateration and Least Squares Based on the Taylor expansion (LSBT). Furthermore, the IM based on hypothesis testing is employed to improve the positioning quality andthe users will be alerted in time to avoid risk from positioning accuracy no longer meet user's requirement. The performance of the proposed IM algorithm has been extensively tested by conducting simulation and field experiments. The experimental results show that the IM algorithm significantly improved BLE positioning accuracy as well as the robustness of the positioning system. The 90% average error (1.9143m) in seven groups of single point experiments was reduced by 34.48% over the 90% average error (2.9143m) of the LSBT method after performing IM, and the maximum error during continuous positioning did not exceed 3m after performing IM, which were better than only using LSBT positioning.

Our objective is to accurately determine which product sections a user is adjacent to while traversing the store, using RSSI readings from multiple beacons, measured asynchronously on a standard commercial mobile device. We further wish to leverage the store layout (which imposes natural constraints on the movement of users) and the physical configuration of the beacon network, to produce a robust and efficient solution. We introduce our node-graph model of user location, which is designed to represent the location layout. We also present our experimental work which includes an investigation of signal characteristics along and across aisles. We propose three methods of localization, using a "nearest-beacon" approach as a base-line; exponentially averaged weighted range estimates; and a particle-filter method based on the RSSI attenuation model and Gaussian-noise. Our results demonstrate that the particle filter method significantly out-performs the others. Scalability also makes this method ideal for applications run on mobile devices with more limited computational capabilities.

Unfortunately, capturing the required measurements to support such systems is tedious and time-consuming, as it requires simultaneous measurements using multiple mobile devices, and no such database are available in literature. This article presents a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) database, including Received-Signal-Strength (RSS) and Ground-Truth (GT) positions, for indoor positioning and ranging applications, using mobile devices as transmitters and receivers. The database is composed of three subsets: one devoted to the calibration in an indoor scenario; one for ranging and collaborative positioning under Non-Line-of-Sight conditions; and one for ranging and collaborative positioning in real office conditions. As a validation of the dataset, a baseline analysis for data visualization, data filtering and collaborative distance estimation applying a path-loss based on the Levenberg-Marquardt Least Squares Trilateration method are included.

In this paper, we propose low cost and energy efficient communication between sensor nodes and ECU using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) within Vehicular Ad Hoc Network by employing Intra Vehicle Wireless Sensor Network. BLE can be readily employed in densely urban environment for inter vehicular (up to 50m range) and intra vehicular (up to 10m range) wireless communication. We have compared BLE and CAN bus for communicating actual engine data between ECUs and sensors, and ECU and Onboard Unit (OBU), in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, latency and coverage area. Proposed BLE based system exhibited very high successful packet delivery ratios for static and driving scenarios with acceptable average RSSI values of at least -10dBm.

An important source of performance constraint in such an IoT network is found in the limitations of its gateway. The capability of a gateway can dictate the effectiveness of a network and its services. The capacity, power consumption, and security of an IoT gateway are revealed as sources of network bottlenecks and service constraints. Blockchain technology can create a decentralized structure that can offload these strains. To unify these nodes as gateways under the same network, we need an effective means of communication. This paper proposes a setup that makes use of the decentralized capabilities of private blockchain technology partnered with the low-powered and secure connection of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This provides a more secure means of wireless communication and prevents the nodes from being concentrated within an area. The architecture was compared against a standard WiFi network (2.4GHz) to prove its feasibility in effectively carrying out its functionality. In an experiment that used 4 gateway nodes, BLE proved to be more feasible than WiFi by yielding a better verification packet rate of 14 per minute compared to its counterpart that measured 4 per minute. Also, it showed to be more efficient in terms of power consumption with an average of 1095.40 mW, while the WiFi setup was measured to be 1191.83 mW. These results show promise in using BLE paired with blockchain technology to solve the capacity, power and security issues in IoT networks.

According to IBM report, the patient-centric healthcare devices should be continuously accessible through the Internet. In this respect, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely used as a last mile communication connecting healthcare devices to the Internet through a smartphone thanks to its long life time and lightweightness. Since the BLE does not support Internet connectivity by itself, BLE devices always need paring with the smartphone. However, if the smart phone is dead, the BLE based healthcare devices cannot access to the Internet and notify emergency data to medical center. This may threaten the life of the patient. In this paper, we propose the BLE platform suitable for the patient-centric healthcare service. We design an adaptive network platform to provide the Internet connectivity for the BLE based patient-centric healthcare devices. The platform includes two key features, (1) applying IETF 6Lo standard to enable the Internet connectivity, and (2) design of Advertising Data Transmission Protocol for ensuring emergency data transmission. By using raspberry pi and CC2540 dongle, we have implemented the prototype of the IPv6 over BLE (6BLE) platform and conducted the experiment.

J	Seong, JH; Seo, DH				Seong, Ju-Hyeon; Seo, Dong-Hoan			Environment Adaptive Localization Method Using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Wi-Fi; BLE; Fingerprint; Database; Log-distance path loss model	INDOOR; SEARCH; SENSOR	Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based fingerprinting techniques for indoor positioning can be readily implemented via a wireless access point. These methods have therefore been widely studied in the field of positioning. However, fingerprinting suffers low accuracy of positioning on account of high noise occurrences which are caused by other wireless communication signals and environmental factors when the RSSI is received, and by relatively high errors on account of low position resolution compared to other methods such as time of flight and inertial navigation technology. In this paper, a modified fingerprint algorithm based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low energy applied to the log-distance path loss model is proposed to remove unnecessary Wi-Fi data, and produce the AP database that can be updated depending on the changes of the ambient environment as the indoor area is increasingly complicated and extended. Instead of using the existing fingerprinting techniques of consulting signal strengths as factors that are stored in a database, the proposed algorithm employs environmental variables to which the log-distance path loss model is applied. Therefore, the proposed algorithm has higher position resolution than existing fingerprint and can improve the accuracy of positioning because of its low dependence on reference points. To minimize database and eliminate inaccurate AP signals, the Hausdorff distance algorithm and median filter are applied. Using a database in which environment variables are stored, the results are inversely transformed into the log-distance path loss model for expression as coordinates. The proposed algorithm was compared with existing fingerprinting methods. The experimental results demonstrated the reduction of positioning improvement by 0.695 m from 2.758 to 2.063 m.

The multipath and non-line-of-sight errors from low-power wireless localization systems commonly result in outliers, affecting the positioning accuracy. We address this problem by adaptively weighting the estimates from the IMU and BLE in our proposed cascaded Kalman filter (KF). The positioning accuracy is further improved with the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against that of the standard KF experimentally. The results show that the proposed algorithm can maintain high accuracy for position tracking the sensor in the presence of the outliers.

The receiver monitors the BLE advertising channels for a pre-programmed pattern. As in the BLE standard, frequency shift modulation (FSK) is chosen to be the modulation scheme of the signal that will be received. This makes the wake-up algorithm compatible with the standard, and hence, it can be generated by a commercial off-the-shelf device. The proposed receiver uses a dual-mixer to down-convert the RF input to reduce the LO power consumption by operating it at half the RF frequency. The receiver has a -57.5 dBm sensitivity while consuming 150 mu W.

The technology has been adapted in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, medical devices, and electrical household equipment. BLE introduces a simplified channel-hopping algorithm as an alternative to Classic Bluetooth-one that masks unfair usage of available spectrum. This paper details a simulation of BLE's data channel selection algorithm. The authors describe a pseudo-code for simulation software to calculate selection probability for each data channel. Results demonstrate that data channels in a BLE system are not selected equitably and the algorithm is more inclined to select data channels with indices between 1 and 21. The probability of collision between multiple BLE communicating pairs is found to be higher than that of Classic Bluetooth which results in a reduced maximum achievable aggregate throughput of 3.18 Mbps.

The current solutions rely on Wi-Fi or custom radio protocols, which are usually access point-centre having all the traffic routed through a single access point, limiting direct interaction capabilities with the surrounding devices. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) forms point-to-point networks directly between two devices without additional networking, thus, a BLE based motion capture suit could enable seamless direct cooperation between two robots or a human , a robot.In this paper, the feasibility of BLE 5 for motion capturing is investigated by designing and testing an implementation of such a motion capture system using existing commercial hardware. More specifically, a mobile phone was utilized as the receiver device for real-time visualization, whereas BLE sensors were used in order to test the feasibility of the technology for actual use and to identify the bottlenecks in the system for future optimizations. The designed prototype system achieved similar or better performance for the static accuracy and delays in the system when compared to the currently existing commercial suits, while providing a feasible throughput for real-time motion capturing.

The world is quickly shifting towards the wireless with phenomena akin to the Internet of Thing (IoT) accelerating this progression. Technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy and Radio Frequency Identification are greatly entwined with this trend, and research has been made into reinforcing protection methods. However, security is a choice made by the designer and more often than not is given decreased priority. With the improved creativity and sophistication of malicious exploits this is becoming far less acceptable. Theft of data is trivial for a user with the correct skillset and will be successful without proper defences. Further research needs to be done in the field, and encouraging consistent security practices is an appropriate start.

In order to ease testing of the Bluetooth Low Energy interface functionality of the personal health gateway devices, a personal health device simulator was developed. Based on specifications from the Bluetooth SIG a XML software test configuration file structure is defined that declares the specific features of the personal health devices simulated. Using this configuration file, different scenarios are defined, e.g. send a single measurement result from a blood pressure reading or sending multiple (historic) weight scale readings. The simulator is intended to be used for educational purposes in lectures, where the number of physical personal health devices can be reduced and learning can be improved. It could be shown that this simulator assists the development process of mHealth applications by reducing the time needed for development and testing.

The receiver has two modes of operation: a low-power mode, and a high-performance mode. It utilizes various techniques for low power consumption at both system and circuit levels. For example, it uses a Low-IF mixer-first architecture to optimize power consumption at system level. In addition, it uses harmonic down-conversion in the low-power mode to enable quadrature local oscillation generation. Circuit-level power minimization techniques include using reduced supply voltages, 500 mV for the VCOs and 700 mV for the front end, using passive mixers, and reusing the biasing currents. The proposed receiver utilizes an integrated configurable matching circuit. The proposed receiver is implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology and occupies an active area of 0.55 mm(2) consuming only 697 mu W and 1250 mu W in low-power mode and high-performance mode, respectively. The low-power RX mode achieves a noise figure of 12.82 dB and an IIP3 of +5.58 dBm. The high-performance RX mode achieves a 6.3-dB noise figure and +2.6-dBm IIP3. The proposed receiver achieves better than 65 dB image rejection.	[Magdy, Ahmed; Khalil, A.

With the growth of wearable sensor technology, wearable sensor provides a low-cost monitoring method for objective exercise assessment. Customized remote sensors combination with off-the-shelf smart phone provides a high performance and low-cost monitoring platform. A connection-oriented sensor network with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) provides high bandwidth encrypted communication. With multiple remotes sensors, synchronization between sensors is fundamental. However, the accuracy with the generic BLE time service is limited. In this paper, we present a novel method that can potentially synchronize multiple sensors with an unmodified Android Device. The method is based on timestamping the Connection Event (Anchor Point) on the Slave side. The results show an absolute error is below 1 ms across two sensors, which is ideal for motion sensing.

Drivers spend an amount of time, effort, and fuel while finding someplace to park their vehicles. Although there are many solutions for free parking space indication; they are only suitable for parking lots inside the buildings, such as the shopping malls However, there are not many solutions for exterior parking lots and for big cities as a whole. The purpose of this paper is to propose solutions to this problem, especially by considering issues like power consumption and communication approaches. A parking-space occupancy detection system is proposed, utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy communication and Arduino-based sensor devices. Raspberry Pi-based central devices redirect the collected data to the cloud-based database system, which makes them available for drivers to use mobile devices with Android systems. The selected components make the proposed system easily deployable and scalable.

With the industry 4.0 revolution, all production activities such as logistics, finance, agriculture, energy and almost all the service and infrastructure applications used by people in the cities we live in will undergo a major change within the IoT paradigm. In this study, a prototype model has been developed and its performance is investigated. Our prototype model can reach the advertisement data of Bluetooth Low Energy sensor devices by using container-based virtualization technology and directly working at layer 2 (L2) of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Virtualization mechanism for the sensor devices could help to exchange context-aware information with Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) structure. Also with virtualization may emerge interoperable sensor node platforms of heterogeneous environments from different vendors.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one promising candidate for such deployments. We study the energy consumption of BLE by measuring real devices with a power monitor and derive models of the basic energy consumption behavior observed from the measurement results. We investigate also the overhead of IPv6-based communication over BLE, which is relevant for future IoT scenarios. We contrast our results by performing similar measurements with ZigBee/802.15.4 devices. Our results show that when compared to ZigBee, BLE is indeed very energy efficient in terms of number of bytes transferred per Joule spent. In addition, IPv6 communication energy overhead remains reasonable. We also point out a few specific limitations with current stack implementations and explain that removing those limitations could improve energy utility significantly.

In the indoor type, the location of the device or the user is obtained within an indoor setting, in which technologies such as Bluetooth are used. The current availability of those indoor positioning systems (IPSs) that employ the Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) approach rendered them to be more popular among users worldwide. Nevertheless, such technologies are still facing a number of issues, particularly those associated with the instability of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The present work targets the improvement of distance and the selection of the optimal algorithm for the classification of the positions based on the BLE technology. The main contribution of this work is finding the most accurate location finding algorithm to classify the position using Bluetooth with low energy technology. To achieve this, we employed a machine learning approach that involves the design of algorithms which facilitate the learning process by the computer. Following the use of a specific four-algorithms training dataset, we achieved the best result at 71% true classification. In future work, we will use the present outcomes in the field of mobile applications.

This information helps to reduce the time spent waiting by balancing people amongst multiple lines or aids in the decision making about opening a new line. However, current queueing systems are often mounted at fixed positions, require user participation, or need time consuming manual calibration after each layout change. In this work, we introduce CutiQueue, a flexible and portable queueing system that is battery powered, needs no manual calibration or user participation. CutiQueue is based on passive presence detection using the RSSI of low cost Bluetooth Low Energy transceivers. We analyze the performance of the system in experiments using a prototype implementation to estimate the number of people waiting as well as the length of the line. The experimental evaluation indicates an average accuracy of 97.96% when compared to counting people walking or standing in the waiting line using a laser barrier.

A Novel Drone-based Search and Rescue System using Bluetooth Low Energy Technology	ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						BLE; wearable electronics; UAVs; localization		Drones are widely known for their mobility and ease of use and represent a significant technological breakthrough with various applications. In this paper, a novel inexpensive Search and Rescue (SAR)-based approach for application in indoor environments is presented. The usage of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been evaluated with respect to other technologies and a conceptual view of the complete setup has been presented. Besides the cost of the drone and the locator devices, the other hardware is relatively inexpensive costing only a fraction of a US dollar. The system is believed to cover a wide area in a small-time frame ranging a few minutes, for instance, a 3600m(2) surface area could be scanned in less than 5 minutes. The system is tested by attaching a BLE device in the payload to evaluate the presence of target beacons. Potential upgrades in the system are also proposed, including design modifications for outdoor use and the application in locating missing objects. This system can confidently replace search parties dealing with missing children in public places or venues, with minimal human interaction while bearing the potential for complete automation.

Digitalization provides new ways of detecting and localizing potential victims via the wireless devices carried by the users. Nowadays, the number of personal Bluetooth low energy wearables in use (smartbands, smartwatches, earbuds...) increases constantly, being a yet-to-be-exploited personal radio frequency beacon in the case of an emergency, where the user may not be localized and unconscious. In this paper, the results of experimental tests of a Bluetooth low energy based detection system ported by terrestrial and aerial robots are provided, in order to test the feasibility of such system for the localization of the victims in unknown complex disaster areas. The results show that the tested devices can be reliably detected up to 15 meters away when using transmission power values typical of a smartphone, while being able to detect even lightly burdened devices. These results support the idea of developing an algorithm for the delimitation of areas of interest for the search and rescue groups, influencing the routes followed by the robot with the objective of exploring the detected devices area in the search of victims.

A stacked and self-biased low-noise amplifier (LNA) with active balun consumes 400 mu W and achieves a noise figure (NF) of 3.2-dB and a high gain ( programmable from 18 to 31 dB), meeting the system specifications over the process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. The RX front-end has a measured integrated NF of 5.2 dB from 50 KHz to 1 MHz that corresponds to a sensitivity of -95.1 dBm. At an RX gain of 47 dB, IIP3 was measured at -19.7 dBm. The LC VCO operates at twice the carrier frequency with a tuning range of 4.55 to 5.15 GHz in an integer-N phase-locked loop (PLL). An ultralow-power CML divider is used to generate the LO I/Q. The integrated phase noise (IPN) of the LO at 2.4 GHz is 0.83 degrees with spot phase noise of -119.9 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz frequency offset. The PLL is entirely placed inside the VCO inductor resulting in an overall die area reduction of 8%. A 6-mu W automatic dc offset-calibrator avoids saturation of consecutive baseband blocks. Multiple mu W-level feedback control loops are used in the design to make it robust over PVT variations. The RX front-end prototype is implemented in a 40-nm LP CMOS process and occupies a silicon area of 0.7 mm(2).

For example, a detailed analysis of human mobility in urban space can provide important insights into gathering events. This insight is useful when addressing urban planning and public safety issues, and serves as a powerful tool for solving traffic congestion, early detection of social unrest, and so on. The analysis of human mobility in an indoor space such as in a museum exhibition, can assist us in anticipating the behavior of visitors; and in the early recognition of potential problems, such as the buildup of foot traffic at specific points. However, there is no universally accepted method for easily sensing human mobility. To address this problem, we developed a novel method to detect pedestrian flow using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Our approach is based on the assumption that a BLE beacon is always affixed to the pedestrian. Thus, the individual's velocity can be readily determined by analyzing the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of their BLE beacon. Apart from velocity, the direction of the pedestrian can also be determined by detecting their BLE beacon with multiple sensors. In this investigation, we evaluated the proposed method using both experimental real world data and simulations. Participants with BLE beacons walked straight in a hall while the RSSI of their beacons was monitored from a moving sensor. This information was used to estimate the velocities of the beacons. We also simulated the RSSIs of the beacons and estimated their velocities under various conditions. Our results indicate that the proposed method can precisely detect the velocities of pedestrians.

J	Zuo, Z; Liu, L; Zhang, L; Fang, Y				Zuo, Zheng; Liu, Liang; Zhang, Lei; Fang, Yong			Indoor Positioning Based on Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacons Adopting Graph Optimization	SENSORS			English	Article						BLE-based indoor positioning; fingerprinting; graph optimization	LOCATION SYSTEMS	Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons-based indoor positioning is a promising method for indoor positioning, especially in applications of position-based services (PbS). It has low deployment cost and it is suitable for a wide range of mobile devices. Existing BLE beacon-based positioning methods can be categorized as range-based methods and fingerprinting-based methods. For range-based methods, the positions of the beacons should be known before positioning. For fingerprinting-based methods, a pre-requisite is the reference fingerprinting map (RFM). Many existing methods focus on how to perform the positioning assuming the beacon positions or RFM are known. However, in practical applications, determining the beacon positions or RFM in the indoor environment is normally a difficult task. This paper proposed an efficient and graph optimization-based way for estimating the beacon positions and the RFM, which combines the range-based method and the fingerprinting-based method. The method exists without need for any dedicated surveying instruments. A user equipped with a BLE-enabled mobile device walks in the region collecting inertial readings and BLE received signal strength indication (RSSI) readings. The inertial measurements are processed through the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) method to generate the constraints at adjacent poses. In addition, the BLE fingerprints are adopted to generate constraints between poses (with similar fingerprints) and the RSSIs are adopted to generate distance constraints between the poses and the beacon positions (according to a pre-defined path-loss model). The constraints are then adopted to form a cost function with a least square structure. By minimizing the cost function, the optimal user poses at different times and the beacon positions are estimated. In addition, the RFM can be generated through the pose estimations. Experiments are carried out, which validates that the proposed method for estimating the pre-requisites (including beacon positions and the RFM). These estimated pre-requisites are of sufficient quality for both range-based and fingerprinting-based positioning.

A capacitor cross-coupled common-gate LNA has been implemented. Due to the very low current consumption (1 mA @ 1.2 V) of the designed LNA, the standard deviation of the noise figure from the LNA circuit is dominated by process and mismatch. In this work, the reduction of standard deviation of the noise figure is achieved. The designed LNA achieves a noise figure of 3.2 dB and a voltage gain above 20 dB at all the bluetooth specified frequency ranges (2.4-2.483 GHz). The noise figure measurement with the whole receiver chain is done. The LNA fulfills the bluetooth system specifications and the measured power consumption is below 1.2 mW.

Ethologists are interested in recording and analyzing these sounds, many of which are vocalizations. Advances in sensing and wireless technology permit today acoustic data acquisition and transmission in a wireless manner. In many applications, the wireless sensor needs to be placed on the animal's body and should be unobtrusive, light-weight, small, and long-lasting. This paper presents the design and development of an ultra-low power miniaturized and lightweight wireless sensor node for monitoring captive zebra finches. The node is designed to be worn with minimal effort by small-sized birds to collect, process, and send/receive data to/from a remote host via Bluetooth Low-Energy. The main feature of the developed node is the capability to stream compressed or uncompressed audio and temperature data continuously. Multiple nodes can monitor several birds simultaneously and acquire and transmit high-quality audio streams, one for each bird, with low audio interference. Due to the combination of low-power hardware and software techniques and technologies, the 1.4 g node achieves a lifetime of up to 24 h at 4 kHz sampling rate on a single zinc-air battery. Experimental results on birds confirm the functionality of the developed wireless node and the lifetime benefits of compression.

The SDK typically provides to developers an easy way to extract this data and use it to implement their algorithms. However, RSSI based localization techniques have known limits. An alternative information to be used in ranging for localization purposes is Time-of-Flight (ToF). Still, this data is not provided by the BLE API, therefore we propose a practical approach for ToF extraction on top of BLE to be used as alternative to or in combination with RSSI. Furthermore, with the paper, we release the sources of the library used to perform the ToF measurement on BLE, that can be used per se or as input for a localization algorithm. We tested the measurements indoor and outdoor at different distances, both considering Line-of-Sight free or occluded by user body. We conclude evaluating ranging performance, test repeatability and comparing the obtained results with the popular RSSI based approach.

This makes them an ideal platform for untethered and interactive wearable devices. However, we lack an understanding how well FPCB-based antennas and sensors perform when worn directly on the body. This work contributes an understanding by studying body-worn FPCBs in three technical evaluations: First, we study the integration of Bluetooth Low Energy and compare the signal strength of our body-worn FPCB with a rigid BLE developer board. Second, we study the accuracy of capacitive touch sensing with two electrode sizes. Finally, we develop a resistive flex sensor based on commercially available FPCB materials and compare its accuracy with a state-of-the-art flex sensor. Taken together, our results demonstrate a high usability of FPCB-based wearable devices.

A proposed quadrature LO buffer employs the transconductor-type IQ quadrature generator with a gain/phase mismatch compensator and generates accurate quadrature signals at the 2.4 GHz frequency with parasitic capacitances. The proposed LO buffer can minimize the power consumption of the LO path because the block generating quadrature signals such as a divider-by-2, a poly-phase filter, and a quadrature VCO can be removed from the LO path. The prototype is realized in CMOS 65 nm process. The LO buffer achieves simulated voltage gain of 6.5 dB and generates accurate quadrature signals while consuming 2 mA at the supply voltage of 1 V.

It also maintains high positioning accuracy. Since the cost of BLE itself is low, it has now been used in larger environments such as parking lots or shopping malls for a long time. However, it is necessary to configure a large number of devices in the environment to obtain accurate positioning results. The most accurate method of using signal strength for positioning is the signal pattern-matching method. The positioning result is compared through a database with the overheads of time and labor costs, since the amount of data will be proportional to the size of the environment for BLE-IPS. A planar model that conforms to the signal strength in the environment was generated, wherein the database comparison method is replaced by an equation solution, to improve various costs but diminish the positioning accuracy. In this paper, we propose to further replace the planar model with a cost-effective fitting model to both save costs and improve positioning accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that this model can effectively reduce the average positioning error in distance by 31%.

Towards an Open Data Framework for Body Sensor Networks Supporting Bluetooth Low Energy	2016 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE BODY SENSOR NETWORKS (BSN)	International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)	JUN 14-17, 2016	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMB				Major companies, healthcare professionals, the military, and other scientists and innovators are now sensing that fitness and health data from wearable biosensors will likely provide new discoveries and insights into physiological, cognitive, and emotional health status of an individual. Having the ability to collect, process, and correlate data simultaneously from a set of heterogonous biosensor sources may be a key factor in informing the development of new technologies for reducing health risks, improving health status, and possibly preventing and predicting disease. The challenge in achieving this is getting easy access to heterogeneous data from a set of disparate sensors in a single, integrated wearable monitoring system. Often times, the data recorded by commercial biosensing devices are contained within each manufacturer's proprietary platform. Summary data is available for some devices as free downloads or included only in annual premium memberships. Access to raw measurements is generally unavailable, especially from a custom developed application that may include prototype biosensors. In this paper, we explore key ideas on how to leverage the design features of Bluetooth Low Energy to ease the integration of disparate biosensors at the sensor communication layer. This component is intended to fit into a larger, multi-layered, open data framework that can provide additional data management and analytics capabilities for consumers and scientists alike at all the layers of a data access model which is typically employed in a body sensor network system.

The proposed TRX utilizes a wide-bandwidth low-power fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) as a central component to perform multiple roles: a direct frequency modulator for the transmitter (TX), an analogto-digital converter (ADC) for the receiver (RX), a local oscillator for RX, and a frequency and phase synchronizer for the RX. The DPLL-based single-path downconversion method is adapted to halve the analog baseband circuit to further reduce the power consumption while maintaining a high interference rejection. A DPLL-based ADC with a digital-to-analog converter feedback greatly improves the ADC dynamic range, which improves the RX sensitivity and interference tolerance. By maximally reducing the required radio frequency and analog front-end components in RX, an RX power consumption of 2.3 mW is achieved with a -94 dBm sensitivity. The RX also satisfied all interference requirements with a certain margin. A 5.0-mW TX is achieved when delivering an output power of 0 dBm with a frequency-shift keying error of only 1.89%.

STUPEFY: Set-Valued Box Particle Filtering for Bluetooth Low Energy-Based Indoor Localization	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Indoor Localization; Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); Fingerprinting; Particle Filter	TIME TARGET TRACKING; INTERNET	With the rapid emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), we are more and more surrounded by smart connected devices with integrated sensing, processing, and communication capabilities. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), referred to as Bluetooth Smart, is considered as the main-stream technology to perform identification and localization/tracking in IoT applications. While single-model BLE-based tracking has been investigated from different aspects, application of multi-model (hybrid) solutions are still in their infancy. In this regard, the letter proposes a novel BLE-based tracking framework, referred to as the STUPEFY, which incorporates set-valued information within box particle filtering context. More specifically, the proposed multiple-model STUPEFY framework consists of three integrated modules, i.e., an intriguing Smoothing Module based on Kalman filtering to reduce the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fluctuations and facilitate comparison of Gaussian models of the RSSI values in distribution with the learned ones; A learning-based model (Coordination Module) utilized in an intuitive fashion to provide/construct a coarse estimate of the target's location together with the smallest axes-aligned box containing the ellipsoid associated with each zone's learned RSSI distribution, and; A novel set-valued box particle filtering (SBPF) approach (Micro-Localization Module). The proposed STUPEFY framework is evaluated based on real BLE datasets and results illustrate significant potentials in terms of improving overall BLE-based achievable tracking accuracy.

We propose a scheme called anti-collision voting based on Bluetooth low energy improvement for the ultra-dense edge, in which one topic can be identified and separated from the others to enable intensive voting. The scheme alleviates the exponential growth of advertising collisions and achieves efficient consensus between the devices and humans by localized the message advertising. The previous proposals focused on enhancing the hardware and optimizing the parameters to establish a connection for interaction. Considering the limitation of connective devices, our scheme adopts a novel advertising model in which the nodes can promptly exit the advertising state by actively responding. In addition, the scheme merges active responses into a group to notify the advertising nodes and randomly chooses a channel to reduce redundancy and save energy. The simulations demonstrate that the scheme can reduce the collisions by more than 90% and channel occupancy by half, while doubling the capacity and efficiently supporting intensive voting within edge networks.

Areas such as emergency management, home automation and building energy management can benefit from the knowledge of occupants' locations to provide better results and improve their efficiency. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons installed inside a building are able to provide information on an occupant's location. Since, however, their operation is based on broadcasting advertisements, they are vulnerable to network security breaches. In this work, we evaluate the effect of two types of spoofing attacks on a BLE based occupancy detection system. The system is composed of BLE beacons installed inside the building, a mobile application installed on occupants mobile phones and a remote control server. Occupancy detection is performed by a classifier installed on the remote server. We use our real-world experimental results to evaluate the impact of these attacks on the system's operation, particularly in terms of the accuracy with which it can provide location information.

The described potential, so-called Human Dynamics, pursues to describe in real-time the human behaviours and activities. These goals are starting to be feasible through the quantity of data provided by two of the main areas of the Internet of Things, on the one hand, the Smart cities to make more intelligent the environment and offer a smart space that sense our movements, actions, and the evolution of the ecosystem, and on the other hand, the wearable and mobile computing which allows to provide data from the humans itself, i.e., from their pockets (smart phones), wrists (smart watches), hearts (wearable sensors), and eyes (glasses). This work analyses the ecosystem defined through the triangle formed by Big Data, Smart Cities and Wearable Computing to determinate human dynamics. For this purpose, the life-cycle of human dynamics determinations in Smart Cities have been analysed in order to determinate the current status of the technology, challenges, and opportunities.

Questionnaires and direct observations have often been used as mechanisms to identify office based interactions, however, these are either very time consuming, yield coarse grained information or do not scale to large numbers of people. Technology has been recently employed to cut costs and improve output, however precise interaction dynamics gathering often requires individuals to wear custom hardware. In this paper, we present an extensive evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a technology to monitor people proximity in the workplace. We examine the key parameters that affect the accuracy of the detected contacts and their impact on power consumption. We study how this system can be implemented on popular wearable devices (i.e., Android Wear and Tizen) and the resulting limitations. Through a real world deployment in a commercial organisation with 25 participants we evaluate the performances of a BLE-based proximity detection technique. Our results show the suitability of BLE for workplace interaction detection and give guidance to vendors and Operating System (OS) developers on the impact of the restrictions regarding the use of BLE on commodity wearables.

The efficacy of a BLE based ILS depends on the localization accuracy. Whereas, localization accuracy depends on the stability of the BLE RSS. A number of researchers have focused on studying the impact of different parameters (such as different type of devices, environments and deployments) that cause the variations in BLE RSS. Today, BLE devices are capable of operating at multiple transmission power levels. Unlike previous studies, this paper focuses on evaluating the performance of BLE based ILS at multiple transmission power levels. Furthermore, the impact of different parameters such as multiple advertising interval, scanning interval, device orientation, distance, the effect of Line of Sight (LOS), Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) and device density over BLE RSS is also studied with multiple transmission power levels. Our main findings show that multiple transmission power level can attain localization accuracy with multiple precisions (i.e. from 2m to 5m) in an indoor classroom environment.

The ULP is reached by using single-stage inverter-based operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA) instead of two or more stages OTA. The effects of the low voltage gain and resistive loading are reduced by using a process and temperature robust negative transconductor connected to the virtual ground.

Using Bluetooth Low Energy Advertisements for the Detection of People Temporal Proximity Patterns	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							CONTEXT-AWARE; MOBILE; INFORMATION; DISCOVERY; INTERNET; SERVICE	The pervasive presence of smartphones has emerged as one of the key elements for sensing people contextual information. Their sensors and communication capabilities can be used to gather a huge amount of data. Such capabilities have made it possible to compose profiles of people by relating different parameters such as time and location. This paper contributes in this sense by providing the basis for the composition of temporal proximity patterns-when and whom people share their time with each other. For this purpose, the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement protocol was used. The contribution of this work departs from that of those who use BLE technology focused on measuring the intensity of the signals to, for example, determine distances. In this field, a huge amount of work has been already done with very interesting results. Instead, in this work, BLE is used to emit and sense the presence of people. A set of algorithms are then used inside the smartphones to analyse the data gathered and to detect proximity patterns between people. This scenario avoids the difficulties that appear in other works-like those focused on people positioning-derived from the lack of precision of the sensors and the differences between BLE chipsets. Tests to evaluate the consumption, precision, and reliability of using this technology, together with the proposed algorithms, confirmed the feasibility of the approach. In addition, the proposal has proved very useful for the automatic construction of social networks based on physical closeness of people.

INF-Based Tracking and Characterization of Museum Visitor Paths and Behaviors Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons	ACM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE			English	Article						Bluetooth low-enery beacons; indoor localization; museum visitorship		This article presents a study that analyzes the visitor experience by using location data collected through Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons. A visual analysis of the visitors' behavior and interactions with the artworks at the Ateneo Art Gallery, the first museum of modern art in the Philippines, was conducted. The Immediate, Near, Far (INF) framework was built on top of earlier studies to provide a finer approximation of the visitors' location in an enclosed space. It was used to operationalize the different metrics used to characterize visitors' behaviors and such behaviors vis-a-vis tracked museum areas such as Holding Power and Attraction Power. Two additional metrics were introduced-the Re-Attraction Power and Nearness. This work strives to contribute to research on museum visitorship particularly within a developing world context.

With these technological developments, new application scenarios are a focal important for research theses. In particular in-vivo animal monitoring is a quickly growing domain, in which the wireless sensor needs to be placed on the animal's body and should be unobtrusive, light-weight, small, and long-lasting, or perpetually working. This paper presents the design and development of TinyBird, an ultra-low-power, miniaturized and lightweight wireless sensor node for acoustic monitoring. The node is designed to be worn with minimal effort by small-sized birds, to collect, process, and send/receive data to/from a remote host via Bluetooth Low-Energy. The main feature of the developed node is the capability to stream compressed or uncompressed audio data continuously. One unique feature of TinyBirds is the capability to harvest energy from a RF Power transmitter with a 12mm x 2.4mm antenna. Moreover, TinyBird achieves self-sustainability when placed 40cm from the RF source and streaming data at 16kHz. Finally the low power consumption of only 157 mu W, when in idle mode that allows the node to achieve self-sustainability with longer distances.

We propose a novel solution that can control actively the power of the tool depending on the worker-tool distance. It is based on RSSI information transmitted by BLE devices arranged in a particular rig, combined with a Bayesian distance estimator. Such an approach minimizes the required instrumentation of the workplace and also the number of configuration parameters; therefore it enables a wide range of applications. Our aim is not only to signal risky situations caused by the misuse of the PPE (either due to its bad fitting or a wrong distance to the tool), but to intervene in a fast and robust way to avoid the safety risk.This solution is built upon previous results on the statistically sound measurement of distances and closeness in construction sites. Here, we contribute with a thorough analysis of collocating several BLE transmitters near orthogonally, which reduces interferences while avoiding the cost of more advanced technologies. We study how many transmitters are needed and what parameters are the best in the Bayesian filter for the optimal performance of the system.Real experiments with a prototype have been conducted in a construction workshop where a person operates a miter saw. The results show how the correct use of the PPE (an earmuff equipped with the BLE transmitters) can be inferred from the distance estimation in a robust and reliable way.

We considered that contact information between smartphones used in these applications can be used for the indoor localization of pedestrians. In this paper, we propose two indoor pedestrian localization methods based on contact information obtained from Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons installed in pedestrian's smartphones. Proposed method 1 is multilateration, and proposed method 2 solves a nonlinear optimization problem to further improve the accuracy of method 1. These two proposed methods comprise three steps: (1) the smartphones and anchor nodes recognize the proximity relationship with neighbor nodes using BLE signals transmitted from other smartphones and anchor nodes. The recognized proximity relationship is sent to a server. (2) The server estimates the distance between each node (smartphone or anchor node) from the proximity relationship. (3) The positions of smartphones are estimated based on the distance between nodes estimated by the server. We verified the localization accuracy of the proposed methods through simulation experiments. In an indoor area of 15 m x 30 m, the average localization error of the proposed method 2 was 0.74 m when the pedestrian density was 0.5 lm(2).

J	Bittner, AK; Jacobson, AJ; Khan, R				Bittner, Ava Katherine; Jacobson, Andrew J.; Khan, Rakin			Feasibility of Using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon Sensors to Detect Magnifier Usage by Low Vision Patients	OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; OUTCOMES	SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated proof of concept for the potential for Bluetooth low energy beacons to reliably collect data to serve as an indicator that low vision patients are using handheld magnifiers for reading, which might be used in the future to prevent the abandonment of magnification or other assistive devices. PURPOSE: Bluetooth low energy beacons are an emerging novel technology involving tiny sensors that collect real-time, continuous, objective data, which might help to ascertain the abandonment of low vision devices in a timely manner, thus prompting a follow-up evaluation to attempt to resolve issues. We evaluated whether Bluetooth beacon data could indicate when low vision patients used handheld optical magnifiers for reading. METHODS: We recorded temperature and/or relative humidity data from Estimote sticker and BlueMaestro Tempo Disc beacons attached to handles of optical magnifiers used for reading by low vision patients in clinic (n = 16) and at home (n = 3). RESULTS: In the clinic, patients whose hand/fingers made direct versus indirect contact with Estimote beacons had greater temperature increases on average from baseline after 30 seconds (0.73 degrees C vs. 0.28 degrees C), 60 seconds (1.04 degrees C vs. 0.40 degrees C), 90 seconds (1.39 degrees C vs. 0.60 degrees C), 105 to 120 seconds (1.59 degrees C vs. 0.62 degrees C), and 135 to 150 seconds (2.07 degrees C vs. 0.97 degrees C). During magnifier usage at home, BlueMaestro beacons measured rapidly increased temperature (5.6 degrees C per minute on average; range 2.7 to 7.3 degrees C) and relative humidity (19.4% per minute on average; range 8.7 to 34%). Humidity tended to reach its maximum increase and return back to baseline significantly more quickly than temperature (P = .007). All increases during magnifier usage were much greater than the maximum room fluctuations without use (clinic, 0.2 degrees C over 120 seconds; home, 0.6 degrees C and 2.4% over 1 minute). The beacons were nonintrusive and acceptable by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Estimote and BlueMaestro beacons can reliably detect temperature and/or humidity increases when held by low vision patients while reading with a magnifier.

Consequently, methods based on geometric properties of anchors, as lateration, are capable of enhancing the positioning accuracy exploiting the growing availability of anchors and their rich geometric distribution in indoor environments. On the downside, an inappropriate selection of anchors decreases the positioning accuracy estimation. Therefore, integrating an effective beacon selection method can enhance the reliability and accuracy of these methods. In this paper, we present a novel and straightforward Lateration indoor positioning method based on effective combinatorial BLE beacon selection. The combinatorial BLE selection approach relies on a geometrical analysis (difference of triangle areas), of each beacon combination, considering the reference beacons' position with the estimated position using lateration, and with a globally calculated virtual target position as reference. The real-world experiment demonstrated that the proposed method improves the traditional lateration with 5% to 16%, considering different evaluation metrics.

Especially, the BLE shows promising results in different fields such as Internet of Things (IoT), health-care, body area networks, etc. As a result of dramatic increase in the wireless device, the frequency interference in 2.4 GHz Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band has raised, resulting a higher packet loss. In this paper, we propose Fast Adaptive Frequency Hopping Scheme (FAFH) to mitigate the effects of interference in BLE. The proposed FAFH scheme immediately hops to a new channel without waiting for completion of the current connection event when the channel quality becomes worse by interference. The simulation results show that the FAFH performs better in dense wireless networks as well as improved performances comparing to AFH scheme.

A highly automated design flow is used to lower the barrier for new developers and to reduce porting cost. In the PLL, a novel two-step TDC (TSTDC) is proposed, which is amenable to P&R, and uses an embedded TDC (EMBTDC) and vernier delay-line TDC (DLTDC) as coarse and fine TDCs, respectively. This combination reduces the required DLTDC input time range by 5x and is used to measure and compensate the P&R induced non-linearity of the EMBTDC. The PLL is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET and demonstrated in a BLE-TX. BLE transmissions satisfy the standard requirements thanks to the reduced fractional spurs by abovementioned techniques. In a standalone PLL mode, the TSTDC reduced fractional spurs by 6.8 dB compared to an EMBTDC alone, and the proposed LUT-based calibration further reduced spurs by 7.5 dB in near-integer operation. The PLL supports frequency range of 1.8-2.7GHz and consumes 3.91mW at 2.4006 GHz, with a 40MHz reference, occupying area of 0.063mm(2).

This study focuses on investigating the feasibility of tracking patients and clinical staff wearing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags in a radiation oncology clinic using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of these networks was compared to relative received signal strength indicator (RSSI) thresholding and triangulation. By utilizing temporal information, a combined CNN+ANN network was capable of correctly identifying the location of the BLE tag with an accuracy of 99.9%. It outperformed a CNN model (accuracy = 94%), a thresholding model employing majority voting (accuracy = 95%), and a triangulation classifier utilizing majority voting (accuracy = 95%). Future studies will seek to deploy this affordable real time location system in hospitals to improve clinical workflow, efficiency, and patient safety.

To achieve the load-balancing network, three design phases, including leader selection, role decision, and scatternet formation, are executed to generate even MMR configurations. First, each master discovers its adjacent slaves to determine a coordinator. Second, the coordinator computes the desired number of piconets with even scatternet link connectivity and distributes the scatternet connection information for each master. Finally, each designated master connects with its associated nodes, including slaves, intrabridges, and interbridges to create the link balanced MMR scatternet. To jointly design an energy-efficient routing protocol for the MMR topology, a hybrid routing strategy is deployed to perform the shortest path routing inside the mesh-ring subnet, and self-routing through different mesh-ring layers. Simulation results demonstrate that the balanced MMR topology leads to a significant gain in terms of network transmission performance and network lifetime when compared to the conventional dual-ring tree (DRT) and cluster-based mesh (CBM) approaches for BLE networks.

It aims at direct powering by the sub-0.5-V energy-harvesting sources like the on-body thermoelectric, eliminating the loss and cost of the interim dc-dc converters. Specifically, the RX incorporates: 1) a two-stage power-gating low-noise amplifier with fully on-chip input-impedance matching and passive gain boosting reducing both the active and sleep power; 2) a class-D voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in parallel with a class-C starter to secure a fast startup; and 3) a mu PM using ring-VCO-locked charge pumps and bandgap references to withstand the supply-voltage variation (0.18-0.3 V). Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the RX operates down to a 0.18-V supply, while exhibiting 11.3-dB NF and -12.5-dBm out-of-band IIP3. The VCO shows < -113 dBc/Hz phase noise at 2.5-MHz offset. The active and sleep power are 382 mu W and 1.33 nW, respectively.

On the use of sniffers for spectrum occupancy measurements of Bluetooth low energy primary channels	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Spectrum occupancy measurement; Channel occupancy; Sniffer measurement; Bluetooth; BLE	BLE	The methods usually employed to measure channel occupancy show limitations in the context of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements. We propose and analyze the use of BLE sniffers as light and portable low-cost spectrum occupancy meters to be used in scenarios where real time signal analyzers are not adequate. For the measurement technique to be successful, several low-level effects must be considered. The paper argues about on-air time, receiving blind times due to processing and intra system interference, buffer saturation and frequency anchoring. Hence, a compensation procedure based on collision rate estimation is proposed. Results with the refined method show that occupancies of 40% can be measured with an overestimation error whose percentile 95% is 5 percentage points. This is reduced to 1.9 points when the occupancy is 15%. The sniffers perform in real time and are shown to correctly track short term load variations. The strategy has been successfully used to characterize occupancy in highly variable and loaded scenarios such as subway platforms and a shopping mall. Values up to 25% have been observed, which implies a relevant packet error rate. Hence, the tool can be used to make agile audits and configure the parameters that control communication redundancy in new or existing networks.

A transmitter (TX) employs an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) with a switched current-source digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) featuring low frequency pushing, and class-E/F-2 digital power amplifier (PA), featuring high efficiency. Low 1/f DCO noise allows the ADPLL to shut down after acquiring lock. The receiver operates in discrete time at high sampling rate (similar to 10 Gsamples/s) with intermediate frequency placed beyond 1/f noise corner of MOS devices. New multistage multirate charge-sharing bandpass filters are adapted to achieve high out-of-band linearity, low noise, and low power consumption. An integrated on-chip matching network serves to both PA and low-noise transconductance amplifier, thus allowing a 1-pin direct antenna connection with no external band-selection filters. The TRX consumes 2.75 mW on the RX side and 3.7 mW on the TX side when delivering 0 dBm in BLE.

Through minimizing parasitic capacitance and maximizing the main inductance, the DCO can mitigate initial oscillation conditions with low supply voltage. The proposed design procedure focuses on how to optimize switched capacitors and their number in capacitor banks within the specifications. A small number of switched capacitors can reduce parasitics and power consumption. The proposed DCO is fabricated using a 55-nm 1P6M CMOS process and meets the specifications of BLE with 0.68-mW power consumption. The phase noise of the DCO is -114.2 dBc/Hz @ 1 MHz at 4.96 GHz. The tuning range of the DCO is set to 4.5-5.3 GHz, which is sufficient to support BLE applications despite the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.

Currently, multiple ideas exist to prevent the elderly from falling, by means of technology or individualised fall prevention training programs. Most of them are costly, difficult to implement or less used by the elderly, and they do not deliver the required results. Furthermore, the increasingly older population will also impact the workload of the medical and nursing personnel. Therefore, we propose a novel fall detection and warning system for nursing homes, relying on Bluetooth Low Energy wireless communication. This paper describes the hardware design of a fall-acceleration sensing wearable for the elderly. Moreover, the paper also focuses on a novel algorithm for real-time filtering of the measurement data as well as on a strategy to confirm the detected fall events, based on changes in the person's orientation. In addition, we compare the performance of the algorithm to a machine learning procedure using a convolutional neural network. Finally, the proposed filtering technique is validated via measurements and simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithm as well as the convolutional neural network both results in an excellent accuracy when validating on a common database.

Given that the two wireless techniques have clearly different pros and cons (e.g., high throughput vs. low power consumption), a device can experience significant performance improvement if the two link layers are utilized adaptively according to wireless environments. However, since it is a nontrivial challenge to address their heterogeneity, the two have been used for different purposes as separated silos. In this paper, we investigate how to operate WiFi and BLE synergistically under IPv6 in the context of a lowpower multihop network. Specifically, we design Wi-BLE, an interface between IPv6 and link layer that handles both control plane (multihop route construction) and data plane (link layer choice for data transmission) for IPv6 over Wi-Fi and BLE. In doing so, we consider various aspects of the two wireless links, such as throughput, transmission range, and power consumption. In addition, to compensate for the lack of a low-power routing protocol for BLE, we design MABLE, a submodule of Wi-BLE, that builds ad hoc routes energy-efficiently by deeply considering BLE's connection-based operation. We have implemented WiBLE on the Linux kernel and evaluated its performance on an indoor testbed. Our empirical results verify that the cooperative use of Wi-Fi and BLE improves reliability and energy efficiency significantly.

This crisis has highlighted the importance of contact tracing in healthcare settings because hospitalized patients are among the high risk for complications and death. Moreover, effective contact tracing schemes are not yet available in healthcare settings. A good contact tracing technology in healthcare settings should be equipped with six features: promptness, simplicity, high precision, integration, minimized privacy concerns, and social fairness. One potential solution that addresses all of these elements leverages an indoor real-time location system based on Bluetooth Low Energy and artificial intelligence.

Existing solutions that do not require an active device at the target, do not fulfil the requirements of reliability, cost and power efficiency and accurate localization at the same time. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a passive, device-free fingerprinting method based on Bluetooth Low Energy. This method takes advantage of the highly configurable and fully connected mesh network of a custom sensor platform. The measurements of the Received Signal Strength values are carried out within a pre-defined network topology. It will be shown that the proposed passive fingerprinting approach does not need recalibration and its median localization error of 1.2 m is constant while using both old and updated calibration data. This is verified by extensive measurements using an experimental setup.

In this context, this paper investigates the possible use of smartphones to create a PEPS (Passive Entry Passive Start) system using the BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) Fingerprinting technique that allows, along with a connection to a low-cost BLE micro-controllers network, determining the driver's position, either inside or outside the vehicle. Several issues have been taken into account to assure the reliability of the proposal; in particular, (i) spatial orientation of each microcontroller-based BLE node which ensures the best performance at 180 degrees and 90 degrees referred to as the BLE scanner and the advertiser, respectively; (ii) data filtering techniques based on Kalman Filter; and (iii) definition of new network topology, resulting from the merger of two standard network topologies. Particular attention has been paid to the selection of the appropriate measurement method capable of assuring the most reliable positioning results by means of the adoption of only six embedded BLE devices. This way, the global accuracy of the system reaches 98.5%, while minimum and maximum accuracy values relative to the individual zones equal, respectively, to 97.3% and 99.4% have been observed, thus confirming the capability of the proposed method of recognizing whether the driver is inside or outside the vehicle.

C	Wong, KCK; Hunter, A			IEEE	Wong, Kenneth C. K.; Hunter, Aaron			Managing Cybersecurity Break-ins Using Bluetooth Low Energy Devices to Verify Attackers: A Practical Study	2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORK SECURITY (CNS)	IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security		English	Proceedings Paper	2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	OCT 09-11, 2017	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE				We present a novel solution in tracking the behaviour of an attacker and limiting their ability to compromise a cybersecurity system. The solution is based on combining a decoy with a real system, where a BLE controller will be placed in the middle, acting like a fob that opens and closes the access of the server's BLE. If the first server wants to communicate with the second server, the BLE must be activated by the BLE controller in order for both servers to communicate with one another. This is a relatively low-cost solution and our aim is to lower the interruption to the live system, capture the attacker's position, and limit the damages the attacker can do to a live system. A second related goal is to lower the attacker's opportunity to detect that they are being monitored. A third goal is to gather evidence of the attacker's actions that can be used for further investigation. This work is significant in that it is implemented within a real physical system for testing and evaluation using Raspberry PI and Arduino boards to replicate servers that communicate wirelessly.

This paper proposes an Iterative Weighted KNN (IW-KNN) indoor localization method based on RSSI (Receive Signal Strength indicator) of the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), which has a low power consumption and a long life expectancy. An enormous amount of RSSI are collected to build a fingerprints database. IW-KNN has three principal improvement approaches. Firstly, Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity are combined to measure the similarity of two RSSI vectors, which can take both length and direction of vector into consideration. Secondly, unlike traditional KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) which estimates a position by a majority vote of its neighbors, a weighting factor is applied to neighbors for localization. Thirdly, IW-KNN selects different iBeacons to obtain RSSI at each iteration and calculates the mean position as the final result after several iterations. Compared with several indoor localization methods, namely, traditional KNN, Similarity improved KNN, Weighted KNN, IW-KNN can estimate positions effectively and decrease the mean error by 1.5 to 2.7 meters in our experimental environment.

Technologies for sensing street-level crowd density are considered helpful in avoiding crowded situations; however, street-level crowd density is tiff& cult to sense effectively using existing techniques. In this paper, we propose a method for sensing street-level crowd density with good accuracy by observing public Bluetooth low energy (BLE) advertisements from popular contact tracing applications. We conducted an experiment in major shopping districts in Tokyo by deploying our developed sensing devices and demonstrated that our method can estimate the street-level crowd density in 30-min intervals with high accuracy, compared to manually counting the number of pedestrians. Using this method, we have begun to publish the street-level crowd density on our website and a news program on Japanese television. Moreover, through long-term monitoring of the collected street-level crowd density data, we analyzed the factors that affect crowd density and constructed a model to predict crowd density from other factors with a coefficient of determination of 0.9 or higher using support vector regression.

An example Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) compatible single-sideband backscatter implementation is described. The FPGA-based approach presented here consumes 35.5 mW, of which 34.8 mW (98.2%) is due to digital logic in the FPGA, and only 600 mu W (1.8%) is consumed by the backscatter modulator. The measured sideband suppression ratio is 10.7 dB. Over-the-air tests demonstrate compatibility with a completely unmodified (neither hardware nor software modifications) iPad, iPhone, Samsung Android Smartphone, and an off-the-shelf BLE chipset from Nordic Semiconductor. This all-digital approach points the way toward future single-chip, inductor-free SSB BLE-compatible backscatter sensors and devices.

J	Gong, YB; Abdel-Aty, M				Gong, Yaobang; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed			Using Machine Learning to Estimate Pedestrian and Bicyclist Count of Intersection by Bluetooth Low Energy	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS			English	Article								Quantifying pedestrian and bicycle traffic is important for planning, investment, and safety improvements. Traffic agencies have implemented various pedestrian/bicyclist detection systems, but the accuracy is unsatisfactory for intersections. Some studies have explored the use of media access control (MAC) address-scanning sensors such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scanners. However, they may suffer from low detection rates. To overcome these shortcomings, this study proposed a system based upon Bluetooth low energy (BLE) scanners. First, the feasibility was assessed by identifying the detection rate and range of BLE scanners. Evaluation experiments uncovered that the detection rate is much higher than the Bluetooth ordinary, and it is sufficiently high for traffic count studies. Moreover, the detection range could cover the whole intersection while reducing the overestimating caused by the large detection range in comparison with other MAC address-scanning sensors. A two-step framework is then proposed for identifying the pedestrians and bicyclists from stationary objects and motorized travelers using one of the popular machine-learning algorithms, one-class support vector machine. The proposed system is validated by the benchmark count data from video footage. The results show that the system can reasonably estimate the counts of pedestrians and bicyclists in a mixed-traffic environment. The average absolute percentage error is 6.35%. This study has concluded that compared to traditional Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, BLE is more suitable for estimating the counts of pedestrians and bicyclists. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

We present Tracko, a 3D tracking system between two or more commodity devices without added components or device synchronization. Tracko achieves this by fusing three signal types. 1) Tracko infers the presence of and rough distance to other devices from the strength of Bluetooth low energy signals. 2) Tracko exchanges a series of inaudible stereo sounds and derives a set of accurate distances between devices from the difference in their arrival times. A Kalman filter integrates both signal cues to place collocated devices in a shared 3D space, combining the robustness of Bluetooth with the accuracy of audio signals for relative 3D tracking. 3) Tracko incorporates inertial sensors to refine 3D estimates and support quick interactions. Tracko robustly tracks devices in 3D with a mean error of 6.5 cm within 0.5 m and a 15.3 cm error within 1 m, which validates Trackoffs suitability for cross-device interactions.

Respiratory monitoring system using Bluetooth Low Energy	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL			English	Article						Beacon; Breath monitoring; IoT; Micropower; Mobile system; Smart sensor	SENSOR SYSTEM; PRESSURE	The paper presents a system for monitoring respiratory frequency and strength using a BLE transmitter in non-connectable advertising mode and a variable impedance sensor operating in a relaxation oscillator circuit. The presented solution is characterized by low energy consumption. Both the measurement system and teletransmission system operate at 2.2 V power supply. By using a micropower operational amplifier, the analogue part of the system consumes 240-300 mu W. Unipolar power supply and configuration of the relaxation oscillator enable to create a pseudobinary signal with the frequency f < 10 kHz. The relaxation oscillator is connected to the microcontroller binary input without having to convert the signal. By using a System On Chip (SoC) with CPU ARM Cortex to control the radio and perform measurements of the pseudobinary signal, the design was simplified and its dimensions were reduced. The operation of the analogue part of the system was compared with a commercial sensor. In addition, the ability of the system to reproduce the breath cycle signal on the BLE side was verified. Differences between the duration of individual cycles turned out to be statistically insignificant, both in the case of normal (p = 0.6889) and fast (p = 0.3226) breathing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Such applications utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmissions, which are short range and can be used to determine infected and susceptible persons near an infected person. The COVID-19 risk estimation depends on an epidemic model for the virus behavior and Machine Learning (ML) model to classify the risk based on time series distance of the nodes that may be infected. The BLE technology enabled smartphones continuously transmit beacons and the distance is inferred from the received signal strength indicators (RSSI). The educational activities have shifted to online teaching modes due to the contagious nature of COVID-19. The government policy makers decide on education mode (online, hybrid, or physical) with little technological insight on actual risk estimates. In this study, we analyze BLE technology to debate the COVID-19 risks in university block and indoor class environments. We utilize a sigmoid based epidemic model with varying thresholds of distance to label contact data with high risk or low risk based on features such as contact duration. Further, we train multiple ML classifiers to classify a person into high risk or low risk based on labeled data of RSSI and distance. We analyze the accuracy of the ML classifiers in terms of F-score, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and confusion matrix. Lastly, we debate future research directions and limitations of this study. We complement the study with open source code so that it can be validated and further investigated.

Twelve capture tags were attached to a custom cart with fixed distances of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.8 m. The cart was pushed along a predetermined course following the lines of a standard dimensions Basketball court. The course was performed at low speed (<10.0 km/h), medium speed (>10.0 km/h and <20.0 km/h) and high speed (>20.0 km/h). Root mean square error (RMSE) and percentage of variance accounted for (%VAF) were used as accuracy measures. The obtained data showed acceptable accuracy results for both RMSE and %VAF, despite the expected degree of error in position measurement at higher speeds. The RMSE for all the distances and velocities presented an average absolute error of 0.30 +/- 0.13 cm with 90.61 +/- 8.34 of %VAF, in line with most available systems, and considered acceptable for indoor sports. The processing of data with filter correction seemed to reduce the noise and promote a lower relative error, increasing the %VAF for each measured distance. Research using positional-derived variables in Basketball is still very scarce; thus, this independent test of the NBN23((R)) tracking system provides accuracy details and opens up opportunities to develop new performance indicators that help to optimize training adaptations and performance.

On the Security of Bluetooth Low Energy in Two Consumer Wearable Heart Rate Monitors/Sensing Devices	SENSORS			English	Article						Bluetooth Smart; Bluetooth LE; security; privacy; wearables; fitness trackers; heart rate; BLE keyboards; usable privacy; usable security	PRIVACY	Since its inception in 2013, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become the standard for short-distance wireless communication in many consumer devices, as well as special-purpose devices. In this study, we analyze the security features available in Bluetooth LE standards and evaluate the features implemented in two BLE wearable devices (a Fitbit heart rate wristband and a Polar heart rate chest wearable) and a BLE keyboard to explore which security features in the BLE standards are implemented in the devices. In this study, we used the ComProbe Bluetooth Protocol Analyzer, along with the ComProbe software to capture the BLE traffic of these three devices. We found that even though the standards provide security mechanisms, because the Bluetooth Special Interest Group does not require that manufacturers fully comply with the standards, some manufacturers fail to implement proper security mechanisms. The circumvention of security in Bluetooth devices could leak private data that could be exploited by rogue actors/hackers, thus creating security, privacy, and, possibly, safety issues for consumers and the public. We propose the design of a Bluetooth Security Facts Label (BSFL) to be included on a Bluetooth/BLE enabled device's commercial packaging and conclude that there should be better mechanisms for informing users about the security and privacy provisions of the devices they acquire and use and to educate the public on protection of their privacy when buying a connected device.

Investigating Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Bluetooth Low-Energy Signal Characteristics for Integration in Vehicle-Pedestrian Collision Warning Systems	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						collision; pedestrian; positioning; RSSI; Wi-Fi; bluetooth; BLE		The purpose of the study is to investigate the comparative field performance of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Classic (Bluetooth) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal modes for integration in vehicle-pedestrian collision warning systems. The study compares these wireless signal modes to find out which one is most appropriate to be utilized in these systems and provides better results in terms of accuracy and functionality. Five factors including received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-distance relationship, rainfall effects on the signals, motion effects, non-line of sight effects and signal transmission rates were selected for evaluation. These factors were selected considering the requirements of vehicle-pedestrian collision warning systems and compared with each other based on experimental outcomes. The results of the experiments indicated the overall superiority of BLE mode over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modes to be utilized in these systems. Application of this mode may provide the possibility of fast collision warnings thanks to low signal transmission intervals and high probability of simultaneous signal detections by multiple signals scanners. Moreover, the capability of this mode to accurately estimate distance and position is higher than Wi-Fi mode and not significantly different from Bluetooth mode.

With the current tools available for public use, sensors have to be updated in a one-by-one basis. Remotely sensors updating through for example remote controls or gateways is not possible. The remote sensors updating concept is becoming more and more realizable due to recent advancements in Internet-enabled technologies. However, this necessitates a blue gateway system that provides services to respond to the remotely sensors updating to enable such Mobile Blue Gateway automation at the edge of today's networks for smart community sensing. To this end, this paper designs and develops a Mobile Blue Gateway which provides a novel way to communicate and distribute information updating through the use of the workload between multiple gateways. It enables the user to remotely update sensors of multiple gateways simultaneously.

Simultaneous Indoor Pedestrian Localization and House Mapping Based on Inertial Measurement Unit and Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacon Data	SENSORS			English	Article						indoor localization; indoor tracking; SLAM; particle filter	SYSTEMS	Indoor location estimation is crucial to provide context-based assistance in home environments. In this study, a method for simultaneous indoor pedestrian localization and house mapping is proposed and evaluated. The method fuses a person's movement data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with proximity and activity-related data from Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons deployed in the indoor environment. The person's and beacons' localization is performed simultaneously using a combination of particle and Kalman Filters. We evaluated the method using data from eight participants who performed different activities in an indoor environment. As a result, the average participant's localization error was 1.05 +/- 0.44 m, and the average beacons' localization error was 0.82 +/- 0.24 m. The proposed method is able to construct a map of the indoor environment by localizing the BLE beacons and simultaneously locating the person. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed method could point to a promising roadmap towards the development of simultaneous localization and home mapping system based only on one IMU and a few BLE beacons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that includes the beacons' data movement as activity-related events in a method for pedestrian Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

J	Yoshihiro, T; Goya, T				Yoshihiro, Takuya; Goya, Takeshi			Indoor Localization under Sparse Bluetooth Low Energy Scanner Deployment for Medical and Nursing Care of Elderly People	SENSORS AND MATERIALS			English	Article						indoor localization; BLE beacon; elderly care; map matching; travel route estimation		Disappearances and falls are problems in the medical and nursing care of elderly people. There is also a shortage of nurses and caregivers, which increases the workload per person. A system that automatically monitors the movements of elderly people and alerts nurses and caregivers of emergencies would make it possible to solve problems safely and efficiently even with a small number of staff. In this study, we propose a system in which a small Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tag is continuously worn by an elderly person and BLE scanners are installed at various locations in medical and nursing care facilities to estimate their routes in real time with sufficient accuracy for practical use. To achieve this, several constraints must be overcome. First, the BLE beacon tags must be small enough to be worn. Second, since a tag must have relatively long battery life, we cannot avoid long-cycle and low-power beacon transmissions. Third, the locations where BLE scanners can be placed in a building are limited, resulting in their sparse deployment. Under these assumptions, we propose graph-based indoor localization for sparse scanner deployment (GILS) as a method that estimates indoor locations and movement paths of elderly people by incorporating the map matching technique in real time. By introducing heuristics to correct locations in real-time location tracking, we achieve a practical level of accuracy in location and movement path estimation even with sparse beacon transmission and scanner deployment.

We are deploying them in our homes to manage the level of comfort, energy consumption or security. While such smart appliances are becoming an integral part of modern home automation systems, their integration into non-residential buildings is problematic. Indeed, smart appliance vendors rely on the assumption that the Local Area Network (LAN) guarantees locality and a single unit of use/administration. This assumption is not met in non-residential buildings, where the LAN infrastructure might cover one or several buildings, and where several organizations or functional units are co-located. Worse, directly coupling smart appliances to the Internet opens up a range of security issues as device owners have very little control over the way their smart appliances interact with external services. In order to address these problems, we propose a solution that couples the use and management of smart appliances with physical locality. Put differently, we propose that smart appliances can be accessed via smartphones, but only from the room they are located in. Our solution combines opportunistic connectivity through local Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with an ultrasound-based method for room level isolation. We describe and evaluate a prototype system, deployed in 25 offices and 2 common spaces of an office building. This work opens up intriguing avenues for new research focused on the representation and utilization of physical locality for decentralized building management.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an advance implementation for Internet of Things (IoT). BLE beacons-based indoor positioning systems provide an easy and energy-efficient, low deployment cost solution for wide variety of applications including smart phones. This paper presents an in-depth experimental study of BLE RSSI in a dense indoor environment. Due to noise, fluctuations in RSSI occur, which produces distance estimation error, which ultimately affect position estimation accuracy. The main objective of this paper is to know the variations in RSSI and develop a radio propagation model in order to minimize the distance estimation and position estimation error. Based on our real-time experimental analysis using BLE modules, there is an average 1.32-m position estimation error in the presence of 10-dBm variation in RSSI. Moreover, we also observed that environmental specific radio propagation constants greatly affect distance and position estimation accuracy in BLE modules.

Any company who responds to customized needs of consumers is said to be great company. In such scenario, having accuracy in tracking and visibility of assets, Raw Materials (RM), Finished Goods (FG) in supply chain becomes of prime importance to any organisation. A multi objective, Raw material and Finished Goods tracking problem, in manufacturing industry is investigated. A prototype is developed to afford timely and effective solutions for this problem using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Technology. Effective and ontime availability of RM and FG has significant effects on productivity and improved output in production operations and also to meet the customer demand. This RF and BLE are emerging technology which is yet to reach manufacturing companies. In this paper, a RFID centred monitoring system for RM and FG is introduced. The RFID technology, Bluetooth and Internet technology are utilized in remote monitoring of Status in the factory.	[Kumar, S.

The initial approach has been to roll out high-level software running on smartphones and leveraging Bluetooth proximity sensing. However this approach lacks both precision in terms of ranging, and flexibility in terms of experimental framework to fully explore alternative schemes for contact event tracing. In this context, we thus provide openaccess nodes in an open-access experimental platform for ranging and proximity tracking, letting researchers tinker freely with the full software stack on a swarm of multi-radio, low-power devices based on cheap microcontrollers. We provide a tutorial on how to use the platform and open source code building blocks to to program the devices, bare-metal. We then report on initial measurements we have performed using the platform. Perspectives with our platform include applicability studies and comparative evaluation for a large variety of localisation schemes combining the use of Ultra-Wide Band and Bluetooth Low-Energy for better precision and smaller energy budgets - and the use of complementary mechanism guaranteeing privacy protection, able to run directly on-board cheap IoT microcontrollers.

Athletes' times are calculated via passive RFID tags and reader kits. Specifically, the reader infrastructure needed is complex and requires the deployment of a mat or ramps which hide the receiver antennae under them. Moreover, with the employed tags, it is not possible to transmit additional and dynamic information such as pulse or oximetry monitoring, alarms, etc. In this paper we present a system based on two low complex schemes allowed in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): the non-connectable undirected advertisement process and a modified version of scannable undirected advertisement process using the new capabilities present in Bluetooth 5. After fully describing the system architecture, which allows full real-time position monitoring of the runners using mobile phones on the organizer side and BLE sensors on the participants' side, we derive the mobility patterns of runners and capacity requirements, which are determinant for evaluating the performance of the proposed system. They have been obtained from the analysis of the real data measured in the last Barcelona Marathon. By means of simulations, we demonstrate that, even under disadvantageous conditions (50% error ratio), both schemes perform reliably and are able to detect the 100% of the participants in all the cases. The cell coverage of the system needs to be adjusted when non-connectable process is considered. Nevertheless, through simulation and experimental, we show that the proposed scheme based on the new events available in Bluetooth 5 is clearly the best implementation alternative for all the cases, no matter the coverage area and the runner speed. The proposal widely exceeds the detection requirements of the real scenario, surpassing the measured peaks of 20 sensors per second incoming in the coverage area, moving at speeds that range from 1.5 m/s to 6.25 m/s. The designed real test-bed shows that the scheme is able to detect 72 sensors below 600 ms, fulfilling comfortably the requirements determined for the intended application. The main disadvantage of this system would be that the sensors are active, but we have proved that its consumption can be so low (9.5 mu A) that, with a typical button cell, the sensor battery life would be over 10,000 h of use.

The simultaneous presence of autonomous vehicles and workers on foot definitely calls for safer designs, vehicle management systems and major developments in personal protective equipment (PPE). To cope with these present and future challenges, the "SMARTGRID" project described in this paper deploys an integrated wireless safety network infrastructure based on the integration of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags designed to identify obstacles, workers, nearby vehicles and check if the right PPE is in use. With the aim of detecting workers at risk by scanning for passive RFID-integrated into PPE in danger areas, transmitting alerts to workers who wear them, tracking of near-misses and activating emergency stops, a deep analysis of the safety requirements of the obstacle detection system is shown in this study. Test programs have also been carried out on an experimental farm with detection ranging from 8 to 12 meters, proving that the system might represent a good solution for collision avoidance between autonomous vehicles and workers on foot.

Feature selection for proximity estimation in COVID-19 contact tracing apps based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)	PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						COVID-19; Bluetooth; Contact tracing; Proximity estimation; Machine learning; Feature selection		During the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing apps based on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology found in smartphones have been deployed by multiple countries despite BLE's debatable performance for determining close contacts among users. Current solutions estimate proximity based on a single feature: the mean attenuation of the BLE signal. In this context, a new generation of these apps which better exploits data from the BLE signal and other sensors available on phones can be fostered. Collected data can be used to extract multiple features that feed machine learning models which can potentially improve the accuracy of today's solutions. In this work, we consider the use of machine learning models to evaluate different feature sets that can be extracted from the received BLE signal, and assess the performance gain as more features are introduced in these models. Since indoor conditions have a strong impact in assessing the risk of being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2, we analyze the environment (indoor or outdoor) role in these models, aiming at understanding the need for apps that could increase proximity accuracy if aware of its environment. Results show that a better accuracy can be obtained in outdoor locations with respect to indoor ones, and that indoor proximity estimation can benefit more from the introduction of more features with respect to the outdoor estimation case. Accuracy can be increased about 10% when multiple features are considered if the device is aware of its environment, reaching a performance of up to 83% in indoor spaces and up to 91% in outdoor ones. These results encourage future contact tracing apps to integrate this awareness not only to better assess the associated risk of a given environment but also to improve the proximity accuracy for detecting close contacts.

Researchers tried to adapt various short-range technologies for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) in ubiquitous health monitoring. The classical Bluetooth is known for its greedy power consumption, IrDA and NFC require line-of-sight conditions, and ANT has weak coexistence features and interference issues. A typical choice remains ZigBee/6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 based solutions in WBANs because of their low-power consumption. However, the recently proposed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) announced more compelling features in various aspects. Only few studies have been published supporting these claims on BLE. In this paper, we present a BLE based remote healthcare monitoring platform and we study its compatibility for ECG monitoring. ECG data requires continuous and real-time transmissions, making it particularly challenging for resource constrained devices. In our system, a BLE112 module from Bluegiga and a BLE USB dongle are used for WBAN. The performance of the system is evaluated experimentally and the results showed good potential of this proposed BLE platform in meeting the main QoS requirements of medical applications in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, and packet error rate, while staying energy efficient.

It uses Wi-Fi for rough positioning and BLE for fine positioning. It is designed for use in public transportation system stations and terminals where the conditions are "hostile" or unfavourable due to signal noise produced by the continuous movement of passengers and buses, data collection conducted in the constant presence thereof, multipath fading, non-line of sight (NLOS) conditions, the fact that part of the wireless communication infrastructure has already been deployed and positioned in a way that may not be optimal for positioning purposes, variable humidity conditions, etc. The ultimate goal is to provide a service that may be used to assist people with special needs. We present experimental results based on scene analysis; the main distance metric used was the Euclidean distance but the Mahalanobis distance was also used in one case. The algorithm employed to compare fingerprints was the weighted k-nearest neighbor one. ForWi-Fi, with only three visible access points, accuracy ranged from 3.94 to 4.82 m, and precision from 5.21 to 7.0 m 90% of the time. With respect to BLE, with a low beacon density (1 beacon per 45.7 m(2)), accuracy ranged from 1.47 to 2.15 m, and precision from 1.81 to 3.58 m 90% of the time. Taking into account the fact that this system is designed to work in real situations in a scenario with high environmental fluctuations, and comparing the results with others obtained in laboratory scenarios, our results are promising and demonstrate that the system would be able to position users with these reasonable values of accuracy and precision.

To achieve this, a demonstrator application is used in multiple measurements to analyze the packet delivery ratio of different setups. Since no official mesh implementation for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been released to this date, the proprietary, BLE-based CSRmesh protocol is used in this study. Besides the measurement campaign, several simulations were performed in order to study the suitability of Bluetooth Mesh in large-scale networks. Our results show that Bluetooth Mesh is a promising technology for mesh applications but additional effort is required during the ongoing standardization process to exploit its full potential.

BLE maintains a data transmission range comparable to the regular Bluetooth transmission, but consumes less energy and cost. iBeacon technology refers to BLE mobile devices, which allow mobile applications to receive signals from iBeacons in both indoor and outdoor environments. It is commonly used nowadays for positioning, location services, navigation and marketing, for the sustainable development of smart cities. The applications, however, can be further enhanced for use in many disciplines, such as education, health sector, and exhibitions for disseminating information. This study performed a set of robustness and performance tests on BLE-based iBeacons in the teaching and learning environments to evaluate the performance of iBeacon signals for positioning. During robustness testing, positioning accuracy, signal availability and stability were assessed under different environmental conditions, and the findings suggested pedestrian traffic blocking the line of sight between iBeacon and receiver, causing the most signal attenuations and variation in RSSI. In performance testing, a series of tests was conducted to evaluate the deployment of the iBeacons for positioning; leading to recommendations of iBeacon deployment location, density, transmission interval, fingerprint space interval and collection time in physical learning spaces for sustainable eLearning environments.

The proposed quadrature G(m)-stage in a mixer performs a single-to-differential conversion and minimizes power consumption of the LO path because the block generating quadrature signals such as a divider-by-2, a poly-phase filter and a quadrature voltage controlled oscillator are not required. The proposed quadrature G(m)-stage adopting the gain and phase mismatch compensator generates adequate quadrature signals at 2.4 GHz. The prototype, realized in 65 nm CMOS process, achieves a conversion gain of 36 dB, a NF of 2.1 dB, and an IIP3 of -26 dBm while consuming 0.9 mA at supply voltage of 1 V.

It is known that many elderly people prefer to stay in their homes for as long as possible and remote monitoring can be a solution, but often such systems lack useful information or are prohibitive due to cost, ease of use/deployment and wireless coverage. This work presents a novel gateway software architecture based on threads being managed by dictionary memory. The architecture has been deployed in a distributed interconnected set of low-cost consumer grade gateway devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that are positioned around the home. The gateway devices can then be used to listen, monitor or connect to BLE based healthcare sensors to continually reveal information about the user with full residential coverage. A further novelty of this work is the ability to maintain handover connections between many sensors and many gateways as a user moves throughout their home, thus the gateways can route information to/from sensors across the consumer's home network. The system has been tested in an experimental house and is now poised to be initially deployed to 100 homes for residential healthcare monitoring before any public mass consumer deployment.

In this paper, we evaluate neighbor discovery latency and energy consumption across various parameters available on an Android smartphone under API 24 for Bluetooth 4.2. We further investigate the effect of concurrent Wi-Fi traffic on energy consumption and BLE packet reception over advertising channels. We found that average discovery latency can be comparable to what state of the art models predict, while exhibiting higher variability across advertising intervals. Energy consumption deviates from that predicted by the chosen models and Wi-Fi interference tests show a much greater impact on energy consumption and discovery latency when interference traffic involves the BLE scanning activity.

The proposed TX is implemented on 1P6M 55-nm CMOS technology with a die size of 0.53 mm(2). The phase noise is -119 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset with frequency of 2.44 GHz. TX output power levels of 1.6 and 10 dBm have a power consumption of 3.9 and 18 mW, respectively. The power control ranges for the 1.6 and 10 dBm modes are 25 and 23 dB, respectively. With the RDF, when the output level is + 1.6 dBm, the second, and third harmonic distortions at the TX output are -44 and -49 dBm, respectively. The proposed TX achieves an error vector magnitude of 3.48% at an output power level of + 1.6 dBm.

A Comparison among Wi-Fi Direct, Classic Bluetooth, and Bluetooth Low Energy Discovery Procedures for Enabling Massive Machine Type Communications	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERNET OF THINGS, BIG DATA AND SECURITY (IOTBDS)			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Internet of Things, Big Data and Security (IoTBDS)	APR 23-25, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	INSTICC		IoT; mMTC; D2D		The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices bring the necessity to support massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) for the Next-Generation networks. One of the enablers for mMTC is the Device-to-Device (D2D) communications. Since it is not possible to reduce the number of devices in massive communications, all the effort for collision and power consumption reduction should be applied to the discovery algorithm of the D2D technologies. The principal D2D technologies are Wi-Fi Direct, Classic Bluetooth, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). However, most of these technologies were not originally designed to support massive communications. The main goal of this work is to assess Wi-Fi Direct, Classic Bluetooth, and BLE performances in terms of number of collisions, energy consumption, and discovery latency, in order to check out the more suitable technology for mMTC scenarios. The results show that Classic Bluetooth is faster than Wi-Fi Direct during the devices' discovery, accelerating network access for the devices in massive communications. Besides, BLE incurs fewer collisions, less energy consumption, and less time for devices' discovery than Classic Bluetooth. Thus, BLE is the more suitable D2D technology-out of the three analyzed in this work-to enable mMTC.

A 266-mu W Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Receiver Featuring an N -Path Passive Balun-LNA and a Pipeline Down-Mixing BB-Extraction Scheme Achieving 77-dB SFDR and-3-dBm OOB-B-1dB	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Balun-low-noise amplifier (balun-LNA); band-pass filtering; baseband (BB); Bluetooth low-energy (BLE); CMOS; hybrid filter; noise figure (NF); nonlinearity; N-path; out-of-band (OOB); passive gain; pipeline; spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR); ultra-low-power (ULP)	R-C CIRCUITS; NOISE-FIGURE; FRONT-END; LOW-POWER; REUSE; TOPOLOGY	This article reports an ultra-low-power (ULP) Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) receiver with an improved spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). It features two passive-intensive RF techniques: an N-path passive balun-LNA and a pipeline downmixing baseband (BB)-extraction scheme. They together offer a high-Q bandpass response at RF, and a high passive gain to suppress the noise of the BB hybrid complex filter. Specifically, the balun-LNA is a step-up triple-coil transformer aided by an N-path switched-capacitor (SC) network to perform in-band voltage amplification, high- Q bandpass filtering, I/Q down-mixing, and input-impedance matching. Instead of using active amplifiers as the first-BB gain stage, we passively extract the four-phase ( I/ Q and differential) BB signals using a pipeline of passive-SC networks that can stack up the voltage gain. Prototyped in TSMC 28-nm CMOS, the BLE receiver consumes only 266 mu W, of which 75 mu W in the BB hybrid filter at 1 V, and 191 mu W in the LO divider + buffer at 0.6 V. Measured at the maximum RF-to-BB gain of 61 dB, the receiver exhibits a noise figure (NF) of 6.1 dB and an out-of-band (OOB)-IIP3 of 22.5 dBm. The corresponding SFDR is 77 dB for a 1-MHz BLE channel and a 10-dB minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNRmin). The OOB-B-1 dB is -3 dBm.

The low-power and low-cost requirements of all BLE nodes are among the most challenging issues when supporting the neighbor discovery process (NDP) for such a large number of devices. Since the parameter settings are essential to achieve the required performance for the NDP, a parameter configuration method for neighbor discovery in BLE can be beneficial for determining some critical parameter metrics, such as the AdvInterval, Scanlnterval, and ScanWindow. In this paper, we propose a parameter configuration scheme to balance the tradeoff between discovery latency and energy consumption. In the proposed scheme, the neighbor discovery latency and average energy consumption are expressed based on the Chinese Remainder Theory (CRT). With the expected primary performance, the parameters are configured accordingly using the parameter configuration algorithm. The experimental results show that the performance of the neighbor discovery varies with the parameter settings. Furthermore, two typical IoT applications are assessed in this paper. Compared with the simulation results, the proposed parameter configuration scheme can achieve high accuracy.

We demonstrate an ultralow-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) v5.0 compatible backscatter communication uplink for the NeuroDisc BCI. This backscatter approach is compatible with completely unmodified BLE devices such as PCs, smartphones, and tablets and has an energy consumption of under 200 pJ/bit, over $50\times $ less than commercially available BLE transmitters. This article is the first to present an analysis and demonstration of single sideband (SSB) BLE backscatter, which increases the available channel power by 3 dB while suppressing out-of-channel emissions. An analytic model of SSB backscatter communication is provided, along with simulations showing how nonidealities in the achieved backscatter constellation impact opposite-sideband suppression. The experimental measurements of in-channel gain and opposite-sideband suppression are provided. Additional experiments demonstrate a range of 6 m using a 20-dBm external carrier source and an unmodified Nordic Semiconductor nRF51DK BLE adapter, while uplinking prerecorded neural data sampled at 500 Hz.

However, reliability is always an issue for the beacon-based interaction since the beacon employs an unreliable broadcasting approach which provides no way to check if the user device has received the correct packet. We define the sparse observation to describe the phenomenon where the number of packets received by the user device within an arbitrarily small time duration is less than the number of deployed beacons. This article studies the sparse observation causing by the following two factors: 1) the unpredictable environmental variations and 2) the uncontrollable operating conditions of a beacon. An analysis is provided to investigate the interaction reliability in connection with the above two factors. Motivated by the above challenges, a novel solution, which exploits the ambient RF fingerprinting to address the sparse-observation issues, is proposed to enhance the interaction reliability. Our proposed solution is validated with extensive experiments consisting of real data collected from both indoor and outdoor environments. Finally, the feasibility of our proposed solution is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept prototype implemented over multiple physical things.

The flooding approach causes network overheads and delays due to continuous message broadcasting in the absence of a routing mechanism. Among the routing protocols, AODV is one of the most popular and robust routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, we optimized the AODV protocol for Bluetooth Low-Energy communication to make it more efficient in comparison to the mesh protocol. With the proposed protocol (Optimized AODV (O-AODV)), we were able to achieve lower overheads, end-to-end delay, and average per-hop one-way delay in comparison to the BLE mesh (flooding) protocol and AODV protocol for all three scenarios (linear topology with ten nodes, multipath topology with six and ten nodes). In addition, the proposed protocol exhibited practically constant route requests and route reply setup times.

Extensive observational and simulated research suggests that distracted pedestrians have a higher risk of injury compared to attentive pedestrians. In the United States alone, an estimated 6,480 pedestrians were killed in traffic crashes in 2017 (5,150 annual average for the past decade), and nearly 200,000 pedestrians were injured. These numbers have been increasing recently, with researchers hypothesizing that distraction by smartphone use may be a major contributor to the increase. One strategy to prevent pedestrian injuries and death would be through intrusive interruptions that warn distracted pedestrians directly on their smartphones. We developed a system, which combines a Bluetooth beacon-based system with a mobile app, to localize the distracted pedestrians when they approach a potentially dangerous traffic intersection.

For seamlessWiFi connectivity in mobile environments, the mobile device should maintain the information of adjacent access points (APs) through the scanning procedure, which often consumes a significant amount of energy and time. In this paper, we develop SplitScan that enables mobile devices to share Wi-Fi scanning information with adjacent stations (STAs) via Bluetooth packet exchange. We evaluate its performance through experiment with a testbed implementation as well as extensive simulation. The results show that SplitScan saves considerable energy and time during the Wi-Fi scanning process.

It is one of the dominant wireless technologies used in various Internet of Things applications. Many indoor localization applications use BLE beacons, however, these beacons lack precise distance estimation due to multipath fading, interference, and radio irregularity. Unfortunately, the impact of radio irregularity is often either assumed or neglected in many research studies, which question the applicability of these solutions in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of radio irregularity on BLE broadcasting beacons. We conducted extensive hardware experiments in two indoor environments, in all BLE advertisement channels of different BLE hardware, and at different distances and transmit powers. These experiments generate values of degree of irregularity which serve as an input parameter for the radio irregularity model. Our results and reported data sets are of vital importance for developing BLE based studies and simulation tools, particularly for indoor localization applications.

Specifically, WazaBee is a pivotal attack aimed at hijacking BLE devices, commonly used in IoT networks, in order to communicate with and possibly attack through a different wireless network technology, considering protocols based on 802.15.4, in particular Zigbee. We present the key principles of the attack and describe some real-world experiments that allowed us to demonstrate its practical feasibility. The attack takes advantage of the compatibility that exists between the two modulation techniques used by these two protocols. Finally, the paper briefly discusses possible countermeasures to mitigate the impact of this attack.

Low power wireless devices are, undoubtedly, the most viable solution for diverse IoT use cases. Among such devices, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons have emerged as one of the most promising due to the ubiquity of Bluetooth-compatible devices, such as iPhones and Android smartphones. However, for BLE beacons to continue penetrating the IoT ecosystem in a holistic manner, interdisciplinary research is needed to ensure seamless integration. This paper consolidates the information on the state-of-the-art BLE beacon, from its application and deployment cases, hardware requirements, and casing design to its software and protocol design, and it delivers a timely review of the related research challenges. In particular, the BLE beacon's cutting-edge applications, the interoperability between packet profiles, the reliability of its signal detection and distance estimation methods, the sustainability of its low energy, and its deployment constraints are discussed to identify research opportunities and directions.

This research developed an ear-attached acceleration sensor of low power consumption for sow welfare studies. The sensor weighed only 10.0 g and was composed of a 3-axis accelerometer, a Bluetooth Low Energy module, a printed circuit board antenna, and a 3-V, 230-mAh CR2032 battery. It entered into a sleeping state when no activities of the monitored sow were detected, to conserve battery energy. In the sleeping state, the sensor still read data from the accelerometer at 1 Hz, but did not transfer data wirelessly to a receiver if a first-order difference that differentiated sow resting from its other activities was below a defined threshold. Laboratory and 8-sow field tests were conducted to assess the sensor performance in three operational modes (continuous, data grouping, and power saving). Results showed that there were three major behaviours of the sows (resting, moving, and eating) and the behaviour patterns differed from sow to sow. The ear-attached sensors could in principle be used to monitor and predict sow farrowing while not causing sow abnormal behaviours. In the continuous mode, data broadcasting consumed 97.6% energy and the battery life was only about 31 days. The average battery life could be extended to about 288 days in power saving mode when the first-order difference threshold was set at 0.1 g. Compared with reported similar acceleration sensors, this new sensor provided more than double the battery life while reducing the sensor mass by more than 70%. (C) 2018 IAgrE.

Development and Evaluation of a Probabilistic Local Search Algorithm for Complex Dynamic Indoor Construction Sites	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; Location tracking; Mobile sensing; Indoor localization	BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; TRACKING; LOCALIZATION	The nature of an indoor construction site is dynamic and complex. This characteristic becomes even more evident when a multitude of interactions among workers, equipment, and materials exists. To assist various operations of construction, which are dynamic and complex in nature, previous research explored sensing technologies to discover advanced approaches to supporting construction operations. In particular, many researchers have focused on investigating the tracking of construction resources over the past several years. Despite the previous research efforts in radio-signal-strength-indication (RSSI)-based tracking systems, signal interference such as signal degradations, occlusions, obstructions, and multipath effects created by a complex and dynamic construction environment has not been clearly discussed. Furthermore, fundamental understanding of issues associated with signal interference is limited. This research aims to reduce the gap in knowledge of the RSSI-based tracking system when it is used in a highly noisy environment like a dynamic, complex, and large indoor construction site. This paper presents the development of a new probabilistic local search (PLS) algorithm using Bluetooth low energy network technology. The PLS is assessed with respect to accuracy, reliability, and robustness. Two conventional positioning methods are subjected to the same tests as a benchmark for comparison. The results indicate that PLS outperforms the other conventional methods when the signal interference is high and performs comparably when the signal interference is minimal.

Even though the Bluetooth Special Interest Group includes and strongly recommends implementations for security features in their standards for Bluetooth LE devices, recent studies show that many Bluetooth devices do not follow the recommendations. Even worse consumers are rarely informed about what security features are implemented by the products they use. The ultimate goal in this study is to provide a mechanism for users to inform them of the security features implemented in a Bluetooth LE connection that they have initiated.

By enabling discover devices in the proximity, BLE could support various mobile Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Obviously, device discovery plays an essential role on the trade-off between the number of devices discovered and the energy consumption for a mobile IoT device with a constrained resource. This paper subsequently proposes a smart device discovery mechanism, named sDiscovery, to adaptively adjust scan window and scan interval according to the variant of the environment. In particular, we record the identities of devices discovered during each scan window and find out the redundant ones. Intuitively, a larger number of redundant devices encountered implies a more stable environment. In this case, the number of unknown devices encountered becomes smaller and the scan window can be shortened as well as the scan interval can be enlarged to preserve energy. The simulation results show that sDiscovery outperforms the existing solution and conventional BLE mechanism from the perspective of power saving. Moreover, we verify the correctness of simulation model through experiments in TI CC2540 development board, where a prototype of the protocol is implemented.

With various novel protocol stack features, BLE is finding use on resource-constrained sensor nodes as well as more powerful gateway devices. Particularly proximity detection using BLE beacons has been a popular usage scenario ever since the release of Bluetooth 4.0, primarily due to the beacons' energy efficiency and ease of deployment. However, with the rapid rise of the Internet of Things (loT), BLE is likely to be a significant component in many other applications with widely varying performance and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements and there is a need for a consolidated view of the role that BLE will play in applications beyond beaconing. This paper comprehensively surveys state-of-the-art applications built with BLE, obstacles to adoption of BLE in new application areas, and current solutions from academia and industry that further expand the capabilities of BLE.

A 1 Mbps 158 pJ/bit Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Compatible Backscatter Communication Uplink for Wireless Neural Recording in an Animal Cage Environment	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RFID (IEEE RFID)	IEEE International Conference on RFID		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on RFID (IEEE RFID)	APR 02-04, 2019	Phoenix, AZ	IEEE				Neuroscience research in non-human primates (NHPs) would benefit from multi-day neural recordings from freely moving animals in unconstrained home cage environments. However, wireless brain-computer interfaces (BCI) face two major challenges. First, a metal animal cage forms a reverberant cavity that leads to dense multipath, impairing the wireless communication channel. Second, the battery life of existing wireless neural recording devices is limited by the energy consumption of the neural data uplink. In this paper, we characterize the channel transfer function of a metal NHP home cage in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, and demonstrate that there is adequate signal strength and bandwidth to support low-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) compatible backscatter data uplinks. For a typical cage and antenna system, the measured maximum insertion loss of the cage-antenna system was 27.4 dB and the minimum -3 dB bandwidth was 5.0 MHz. We demonstrate a 1 Mbps BLE compatible backscatter communication link achieving a worst-case packet error rate of 1.05%, yielding an effective bit error rate of 5.6 x 10(-5), exceeding the BLE requirement of <= 10(-3). The backscatter link has a measured energy consumption of 158 pJ/bit, compared with approximate to 10nJ/bit for existing WiFi and Bluetooth chipsets.

The system uses the signals broadcast by an array of BlueTooth Low Energy iBeacons deployed in the building as input to a trilateration calculation. The method described could be applied to RF emitters other than BlueTooth, including WiFi access points. The results of experiments conducted in a live classroom building in which the iBeacons are deployed demonstrate 100% accurate floor identification and mean distance accuracies within 5 meters. The solution's multistory accuracy and its low cost in terms of money, data collection effort, and simplicity of the calculations demonstrate this as a reasonable solution to the problem of locating emergency callers in multistory buildings.

These IoT systems often rely on self-organizing networks to enable devices to discover and connect with each other. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an energy-efficient radio communication technology that is rapidly gaining popularity for various IoT applications. While BLE has been designed for simple and quick data exchange, it still requires pre-defined connection roles that determine which devices can initiate or accept connections. This limits its usefulness for ad-hoc environments, where devices do not fit into the classic master/ slave (or client/server) paradigm. In this paper, we propose and evaluate BlueNet, a BLE-based communication framework that allows devices to frequently switch between the peripheral and central roles, thereby providing data exchange opportunities between devices without pre-defined roles. This work further proposes several communication protocols with the goal to efficiently manage connections and to balance the traffic among devices. Simulations based on the MiXiM framework are used to evaluate how these strategies impact communication delays and packet delivery ratios for single-hop and multi-hop ad-hoc BLE communications.

The BLE standard specifies a wide range of configurable parameter values that determine the discovery process and need to be set according to the particular application requirements. Many previous works have been addressed to investigate the discovery process through analytical and simulation models, according to the ideal specification of the standard. However, measurements show that additional scanning gaps appear in the scanning process, which reduce the discovery capabilities. These gaps have been identified in all of the analyzed devices and respond to both regular patterns and variable events associated with the decoding process. We have demonstrated that these non-idealities, which are not taken into account in other studies, have a severe impact on the discovery process performance. Extensive performance evaluation for a varying number of devices and feasible parameter combinations has been done by comparing simulations and experimental measurements. This work also includes a simple mathematical model that closely matches both the standard implementation and the different chipset peculiarities for any possible parameter value specified in the standard and for any number of simultaneous advertising devices under scanner coverage.

This paper presents a low latency audio coder design with a short length window. Side effects due to the short length window are mitigated by the proposed coding tools such as pitch coding and low frequency masking threshold control. The audio quality assessed by the objective and subjective manners shows that the proposed design outperforms the well-known commercial codec.

In order to collect and store this data, some of the already existing local networking IoT technologies can be used. However, industrial IoT solutions are often deployed in areas with limited Internet connectivity, and delivering this data to the cloud represents a challenge. In this paper, we propose the design of a field gateway device, deployed in the industrial IoT solution with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) sensors. The gateway stores BLE sensory data locally and periodically delivers it to the cloud using 3G cellular network connection.

However, most of existing positioning technologies have high errors or require some extra special hardware. This study proposes an algorithm to change the environmental attenuation factor and compensation mechanism according to the current situation of the environment, and reduce the signal anomaly caused by the decrease of positioning accuracy. To ensure the positioning system has a certain positioning accuracy to achieve system efficiency, the method consists of three stages: First of all, calculate the current environmental attenuation factor by distance. Secondly, compensate the lack of signal distance according to the compensation mechanism. Finally, the triangulation method and the revised signal are used to locate. The experimental results show that the average positioning error of the proposed method is less than 0.5 m, which is better than some of the existing positioning methods, and provides accuracy and practicality to the positioning system.

Indoor Positioning System Based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy	2022 8TH INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT (IEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Engineering Conference on advances in Computer and Civil Engineering Towards Engineering Innovations and Sustainability (IEC)	FEB 23-24, 2022	Erbil, IRAQ			Wi-Fi; BLE; Indoor positioning; RSSI; Trilateration; Bluetooth	LOCALIZATION; COEXISTENCE; ZIGBEE	With the increase in the popularity of wireless technology, almost all utilize their handset for much more than just making phone calls. One of the easy-to-implement applications is to locate objects and place them under surveillance, such as children, patients, or even valuable possessions. The idea is to exploit the possibility of routers that work with a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signal for additional applications to perform tasks without an added cost. In this paper, a proposed model that included 3 Access Points (APs) and one target are installed in a case study room with a dimension of 8*8 m(2) to localize and track the target within it. The 3 APs are installed in a chosen location to apply the Trilateration algorithm in order to, detect the location of such target. Also, the APs signal is used Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to compare which one is precise. The tools used for measuring the received signal (AirPort Utility) and (Bluetooth Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) Analyzer) for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth respectively. The results show that the average errors are 1.3 m and 1.7 m for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth respectively. From this result, we conclude that estimating coordinates inside the room using Wi-Fi technology is more accurate than using Bluetooth technology under the same conditions. This model can be added as an additional application to the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices that are available in our life.

The sensor is powered by a small rechargeable battery and is designed for extremely low power use. However, the autonomy of the sensor, regarding its power consumption, depends significantly on the measurement quality selection, which directly influences the amount of data transferred. Therefore, we perform an in-depth analysis of the power consumption sources, particularly those connected with the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocol, in order to model and then tune the autonomy of the wireless low-power body sensor for long-term ECG monitoring. Based on the findings, we propose two analytical models for power consumption: one for power consumption estimation in idle mode and the other one for power estimation in active mode. The proposed models are validated with the measured power consumption of the ECG sensor at different ECG sensor settings, such as sampling rate and transmit power. The proposed models show a good fit to the measured power consumption at different ECG sensor sampling rates. This allows for power consumption analysis and sensor autonomy predictions for different sensor settings. Moreover, the results show that the transmit power has a negligible effect on the sensor autonomy in the case of streaming data with high sampling rates. The most energy can be saved by lowering the sampling rate with suitable connection interval and by packing as much data as possible in a single BLE packet.

Especially, it can be regarded as an essential element for the ship's safety. However, unlike terrestrial communication, there is a disadvantage in that fixed terrain cannot be used. Therefore, communications of maritime were common to use a satellite or combinations of VHF and satellite. However, in case of fishing vessels using marine resources, although they cannot prepare for marine accidents, they don't use those communications on the coast because of exposing their fishing positions such as their know-how. In this paper, we propose a system that can additionally contribute to preventing marine accidents as making a local network by using Bluetooth and noting the dangerous situation at the coast.

Strong authentication security demands, among other requirements, long, frequently hard-to-remember passwords. Two-factor authentication aids in the security, even though, as a side effect, might worsen user experience. We depict a mobile sign-on scheme that benefits from the dynamic relationship between a user's attributes, the service the user wishes to utilize, and location (where the user is, and what services are available there) as an authentication factor. We demonstrate our scheme employing Bluetooth Low Energy beacons for location awareness and the expressiveness of Attribute-Based Encryption to capture and leverage the described relationship. Bluetooth Low Energy beacons broadcast encrypted messages with encoded access policies. Within range of the beacons, a user with appropriate attributes is able to decrypt the broadcast message and obtain parameters that allow the user to perform a short or simplified login.

Although there is some similarity to the original definition, the low energy version works upon some fundamentally different RF coding principles and parameters. Bluetooth low energy can also serve for linking sports and health sensors to personal, ubiquitous devices like smartphones - a mode that is already provided by yet another communication standard, which is called ANT+. The latter was invented and introduced some years earlier as common standard for enabling interoperation of sports consumer devices, and it was implemented as well into certain smartphone product branches of several famous vendors. Focusing the application in personal sports and health care, the two competing concepts are evaluated and compared in this investigation here. Especially the technical features and their impact on design structures and implementation efforts are discussed on base of a particular, quite typical sample application scenario.

CleanHands uses a combination of low-cost Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon tags and mobile phones for HCP tracking. It integrates infection control models and state-following algorithms for alarming in the event of noncompliance to hand hygiene.

Originally designed as cable replacement connecting devices in a point-to-point fashion its high penetration arouses interest in its ad-hoc networking potential. This ad-hoc networking potential of Bluetooth is advertised for years - but until recently no actual products were available and less than a handful of real Bluetooth multi-hop network deployments were reported. The turnaround was triggered by the release of the Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Profile which is unquestionable a great achievement but not well suited for all use cases of multi-hop networks. This paper surveys the tremendous work done on Bluetooth multi-hop networks during the last 20 years. All aspects are discussed with demands for a real world Bluetooth multi-hop operation in mind. Relationships and side effects of different topics for a real world implementation are explained. This unique focus distinguishes this survey from existing ones. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first survey consolidating the work on Bluetooth multi-hop networks for classic Bluetooth technology as well as for Bluetooth Low Energy. Another individual characteristic of this survey is a synopsis of real world Bluetooth multi-hop network deployment efforts.

Research paper Feasibility of Bluetooth Low Energy wearable tags to quantify healthcare worker proximity networks and patient close contact: A pilot study	INFECTION DISEASE & HEALTH			English	Article						Epidemiology; Healthcare-associated infections; Coronavirus; Technology; Contact tracing		Background: The hospital environment is characterised by a dense network of interactions between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients. As highlighted by the coronavirus pandemic, this represents a risk for disease transmission and a challenge for contact tracing. We aimed to develop and pilot an automated system to address this challenge and describe contacts between HCWs and patients. Methods: We developed a bespoke Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system for the hospital environment with anonymous tags worn by HCWs and fixed receivers at patient room doors. Proximity between wearable tags inferred contact between HCWs. Tag-receiver interactions inferred patient room entry and exit by HCWs. We performed a pilot study in four negative pressure isolation rooms from 13 April to 18 April 2021. Nursing and medical staff who consented to participate were able to collect one of ten wearable BLE tags during their shift. Results: Over the four days, when divided by shift times, 27 nursing tags and 3 medical tags were monitored. We recorded 332 nurse-nurse interactions, for a median duration of 58 s [interquartile range (IQR): 39-101]. We recorded 45 nursing patient room entries, for a median 7 min [IQR: 3-21] of patient close contact. Patient close contact was shorter in rooms on airborne precautions, compared to those not o transmission-based precautions. Conclusion: This pilot study supported the functionality of this approach to quantify HCW prox-imity networks and patient close contact. With further refinements, the system could be scaled-up to support contact tracing in high-risk environments. 2021 The Author(s).

At this point, researches are made about the low power consumption of the devices, fast and secure communication. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) ensures these requirements and is developing day by day to provide a low-energy and low-cost solution for the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, in-vehicle electronics technology is becoming essential with respect to customer needs. According to claim report results of one of the reputable automotive manufacturers indicates that, the crucial expectation of prospects and customers is to have safety electronic systems and following up the status of the car remotely. Due to this reason consumer electronics and internet of things (IoT) technologies are depending on the assessment of needs. In order to follow up status of car remotely, Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and acceleration sensors are widely used in vehicle electronics. In this study, a prototype fuel level control system is implemented using wireless sensor networks via BLE. The fuel level sensor is placed into the fuel tank to collect the data at rest the vehicle in parked positon and engine off. Fuel levels are measured inside the fuel tank for the different scenarios. If an abrupt change occurs in the fuel level, the users is informed via vehicle tracking system. The current work aims processing data locally, transmitting via Bluetooth Low Energy and reporting the output data. The results/outputs of the system implementation are evaluated statistically with experimental design.

In order to reduce the energy consumption of the wireless sensor with continuous data collecting, a strategy of data transmission for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is proposed in this paper. The method aims to cut down the transmission average current by changing the size of sensor data packet (packaged with different numbers of data unit) in the same sampling frequency of sensors. Two commonly-used Bluetooth 4.0 chips, CC2541 and nRF51822 were compared in this experiment and the result shows that the average current of data transmission reduced obviously by the packaging strategy. This method makes the wireless wearable devices based on BLE become more suitable for the continuous data collection system.

These beacons are typically used to broadcast small amounts of location-dependent data (e.g., advertisements) or to detect nearby objects. However, researchers have shown that beacons can also be used for indoor localization converting the received signal strength indication (RSSI) to distance information. In this work, we study the effectiveness of proximity beacons for accurately locating objects within a manufacturing plant by performing extensive experiments in a real industrial environment. To this purpose, we compare localization algorithms based either on trilateration or environment fingerprinting combined with a machine-learning based regressor (k-nearest neighbors, support-vector machines, or multi-layer perceptron). Each algorithm is analyzed in two different types of industrial environments. For each environment, various configurations are explored, where a configuration is characterized by the number of beacons per square meter and the density of fingerprint points. In addition, the fingerprinting approach is based on a preliminary site characterization; it may lead to location errors in the presence of environment variations (e.g., movements of large objects). For this reason, the robustness of fingerprinting algorithms against such variations is also assessed. Our results show that fingerprint solutions outperform trilateration, showing also a good resilience to environmental variations. Given the similar error obtained by all three fingerprint approaches, we conclude that k-NN is the preferable algorithm due to its simple deployment and low number of hyper-parameters.

The technology used for data transmission and sensor data acquisition settings can have a significant impact on a beacon's battery lifetime. As our work suggests, it is possible to greatly increase the life of such a device by simply reducing the sampling/transmission actions rates or by changing the way in which the Bluetooth Low Energy advertisement payloads are sent. The operating period of the system, running on a 3 V coin cell battery with a capacity of 230 mAh, can go up to roughly 2.4 years. Future developments of the described system can be achieved by replacing the battery with power harvesting elements or by complementing the sensing unit, which currently provides ambient parameters of temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure, with Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Dioxide, or Volatile organic compound gas sensors.

One of the most dangerous dementia symptoms is wandering. It consists in aimless walking and spatial disorientation, which might lead to various unpleasant situations like falling down accidents at home to leaving the living place and going missing. Therefore, in order to ensure elderly people's safety it is crucial to detect and alarm the caregivers in case of such incidents. It can be done by tracking the sufferers movements and detecting signs of repetitiveness. The paper presents the results of the study, in which the wandering behavior of people suffering from dementia was monitored using a Bluetooth Low Energy based positioning system. The paper includes the description of the system used for patients localization and the results of the tests performed in a long term care facility.

Despite the increasing number of IoT devices and the improving performance of BLE, the usage model is still limited to point-to-point with no mobility. This limitation prevents the devices to spread across a large field or a home. While multi-hop technologies had been studied and commercialized, they do not fully take advantage of the BLE's low-power feature; and their configurations cannot easily be changed once the network is deployed. We have designed an architecture called BlueSkyNet. It allows network administrators to form and manage a BLE multi-hop network that allows nodes to be mobile. It takes advantage of the improving performance of BLE, and allows the network configurations to be modified in a software-defined way.

Among a wide set of standard wireless technologies already available on the market, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is becoming one of the most widespread and exploited. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology for analyzing and characterizing throughput performance in general sensor network applications. In particular, we want to assess the effective BLE performance in order to investigate its possible usage in applications that require high throughput, such as body area network (BAN) for motion tracking of human movements, using magneto-inertial sensor units (M-IMUs). In addition to this, we have also studied how different nodes, with different hardware, software, and firmware, can affect the network performance. The results of this paper show how different typologies of nodes can be better exploited dependently on the specific application they are involved in. In fact, we define how to set up BLE parameters in order to push this technology to its limit. Finally, we address the specific case of using BLE as the wireless infrastructure of a BAN for human motion tracking: in this scenario, we show that BLE can be employed to successfully transmit M-IMU data from 5 peripheral nodes with a sampling frequency higher than 200 Hz.

Traditional lateration-based techniques have limitations, such as localization error, and modeling of distance estimates from received signals. Fingerprinting based tracking solutions are also environment dependent. On the other side, machine learning-based techniques are currently attracting industries for developing tracking applications. In this paper we have modeled a machine learning method known as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for real time dynamic object localization. The experimental results are based on real time trajectories, which validated the effectiveness of our proposed system in terms of accuracy compared to naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, a support vector machine and a decision tree.

These two facts are important for IoT applications making BLE a good candidate to be chosen over other communication technologies (WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth Classic). One key point of the automatic fare collection system is the passenger detection. As passenger nowadays are likely to carry smartphones with embedded BLE function. Therefore, first in this paper will be explained how Bluetooth Low Energy can be used in public transportation systems such as in a Low Floor Wireless Tram to check if someone took in fact a public transportation vehicle (such as: bus, train, metro or tram) or if he or she is just nearby (waiting for the next vehicle for example). Next, it will be explained how to improve Bluetooth Low Energy passenger's location detection when using RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength Indication) for this task.

Thanks to the extensive current reuse scheme combined with the passive source-boosting topology and exploiting forward back gate biasing (FBB) of active devices, the low -noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) input impedance is matched to 50 Omega with 18 times less current compared to a single common-gate (CG) LNTA. Moreover, a high swing Class-C VCO operating at the twice the desired frequency drives the frequency divider by 2 to create 4 phases with 25% duty cycle. Implemented in 22 nm FD-SOI technology, the proposed receiver front-end consumes only 330 mu W from 0.55 V and occupies an active area of 0.15 mm(2). The measured conversion gain and NF are 32.3 dB and 9.4 dB respectively. The proposed receiver consumes the least power among all previous published papers while its performance is largely superior to the requirement of intended applications.

Development and Power Characterization of an IoT Network for Agricultural Imaging Applications	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						IoT; smart farming; ESP32; Bluetooth low energy; firebase cloud		This paper describes the development and characterization of a prototype IoT network for use with agricultural imaging and monitoring applications. The sensor and gateway nodes are designed using the ESP32 SoC with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 and Wi-Fi. A development board, the Arducam IoTai ESP32, is used for prototyping, testing, and power measurements. Google's Firebase is used as the cloud storage site for image data collected by the sensor. The sensor node captures images using the OV2640 2MP camera module and transmits the image data to the gateway via Bluetooth Low Energy. The gateway then uploads the collected images to Firebase via a known nearby Wi-Fi network connection. This image data can then be processed and analyzed by computer vision and machine learning pipelines to assess crop growth or other needs. The sensor node achieves a wireless transmission data throughput of 220kbps while consuming 150mA of current; the sensor sleeps at 162 mu A. The sensor node device lifetime is estimated to be 682 days on a 6600mAh LiPo battery while acquiring five images per day based on the development board power measurements. This network can be utilized by any application that requires high data rates, low power consumption, short range communication, and large amounts of data to be transmitted at low frequency intervals.

The system prototype was developed and tested using an electric vehicle (EV) and the respective sensor systems. The main components of the proposed IoT system are: a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) intra-vehicular wireless sensor network (IVWSN); a mobile device that acts both as the vehicle's gateway, connecting the IVWSN to the Internet, and as the vehicle's human machine interface (HMI); an online server/database, based on Firebase; a client, which can be either a mobile device or a personal computer; and a residential wireless sensor network (WSN). The use of a wireless network to collect sensor data inside of the vehicle introduces some advantages when compared with conventional wired networks, whereas the inclusion of a residential WSNs in the proposed IoT architecture allows the provision of additional features, such as automatic control of the EV battery charging process. Experimental results are provided to assess the performance of the developed IVWSN and HMI.

Its main goal is to provide to a hospital staff the ability to track the movement of patients and quickly to locate their position in order to prevent unauthorized departure and to increase security in hospital wards, both under normal conditions and in compliance with a quarantine. The proposed system uses two approaches that are based on heuristic algorithms. The first one determines the number and location of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons in the territory of the target building. The other one is a method for indoor positioning of a mobile device - a specialized bracelet that uses Bluetooth Low Energy beacons as. reference points. The results of stimulation experiments show that the combination of these both components of such indoor positioning system can be an effective solution for locating and tracking patients in a hospital.

A passive linearizer is integrated at the input of the CMOS PA to nullify the effect of the Cgs capacitance thus improving the linearity and efficiency without trading-off the power gain and stability. The PA delivers more than 10dB power gain from 2.4GHz to 2.5GHz. At centre frequency of 2.45GHz, the PA exhibits gain of 11.5dB with corresponding PAE of 38.4% and maximum output power of 15dBm followed by OIP3 of 20.3dBm. This performance is achieved with supply voltage headroom of 1.8V. The proposed linearization scheme serves to be a good solution to improve the linear output power of a CMOS PA without trading off other critical parameters.

An iBeacon is a Bluetooth Low Energy device that only sends a signal in a specific format. They are like a lighthouse that sends light signals to boats. This paper explains what an iBeacon is, how it works and how it can simplifiy your daily life, what restriction comes with iBeacon and how to improve this restriction., as well as, how to use Location-based Services to track items. E.g., every time you touchdown at an airport and wait for your suitcase at the luggage reclaim, you have no information when your luggage will arrive at the conveyor belt. With an iBeacon inside your suitcase, it is possible to track the luggage and to receive a push notification about it even before you can see it. This is just one possible solution to use them. iBeacon can create a completely new shopping experience or make your home smarter. This paper demonstrates the luggage tracking use case and evaluates its possibilities and restrictions.

Previous works have unveiled several security and privacy issues in the involved protocols. These works extensively studied AirDrop while the coverage of the remaining vast Continuity service space is still low. To facilitate the cumbersome reverse-engineering process, we describe the first guide on how to approach a structured analysis of the involved protocols using several vantage points available on macOS. Also, we develop a toolkit to automate parts of this otherwise manual process. Based on this guide, we analyze the full protocol stacks involved in three Continuity services, in particular, Handoff (HO), Universal Clipboard (UC), and Wi-Fi Password Sharing (PWS). We discover several vulnerabilities spanning from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements to Apple's proprietary authentication protocols. These flaws allow for device tracking via HO's mDNS responses, a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on HO and UC, a DoS attack on PWS that prevents Wi-Fi password entry, and a machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on PWS that connects a target to an attacker-controlled Wi-Fi network. Our PoC implementations demonstrate that the attacks can be mounted using affordable off-the-shelf hardware ($20 micro:bit and a Wi-Fi card). Finally, we suggest practical mitigations and share our findings with Apple, who have started to release fixes through iOS and macOS updates.

The fast discovery of all BLE advertisers is one of the most challenging tasks in supporting such a large number of BLE-enabled services successfully. However, there has been no research published so far that presents a method of setting parameters that provide the best performance in the BLE neighbor discovery process. In this paper, we propose a method to determine an optimal value for the BLE advertisement interval to minimize the time in which all surrounding BLE advertisers are discovered by a scanner. To obtain the optimal advertisement interval, we derive a new analytical model to characterize the BLE discovery time with all possible parameters. We also analyze the effect of the optimal advertisement interval on energy consumption. The analytical model is validated by comparing the analysis results with the simulations. The simulation results show that the optimal advertisement interval for a given number of BLE advertisers can minimize the discovery time, and the energy consumption also is reduced significantly.

This technology can be used in indoor and outdoor settings such as museums, shops, home and schools in order to identify the location of learners and their contexts. Specifically, in the constructivist view of learning, learners can use such sensing technology for constructing knowledge and experiencing learning at any time, anywhere. However, exploration of such technology has been limited in the constructivist context-aware ubiquitous learning (U-learning) literature. For this purpose, the authors evaluated two android-based U-learning applications: one was an outdoor learning environment in a garden, the other was about locating books in a library. The applications were implemented and tested with school and university students. The qualitative results are presented in this article, and show how such sensing technology is promising for both pedagogical environments.

It opens new paths for passive mobility analysis, and allows building larger datasets direly needed by the research on mobile systems, but also raises new practical challenges. One of them is the correlation between the public packets and the emitters. The Bluetooth standard forces devices to change the identifier they embed within the public packets regularly, but we show in this paper it does not prevent packet correlation. The number of devices changing their MAC address at any given time is expectedly small; we only need to find a property differentiating a handful device at a time for MAC association. In this paper, we propose such a property and demonstrate the efficiency of the association strategy on Bluetooth Low Energy.

This demonstration shows the potential for reusing the wireless chipsets in future full-duplex devices as readers for backscatter tags and other backscatter-based devices.

These PHY modes enable an application to either double its throughput, or significantly improve its reliability, making BLE applicable to an even wider range of application domains. Unfortunately, no experimental study has yet investigated the actual performance of BLE 5's PHY modes in BLE connections or shown their trade-offs between energy efficiency, reliability, and throughput. Thus, how to use BLE 5's PHY modes to achieve specific application requirements is still an open question. To fill this gap, we experimentally study the performance of all four BLE 5 PHY modes in BLE connections and observe that it is, indeed, possible to double BLE's throughput or to increase BLE's reliability by using the new PHY modes. Furthermore, we provide guidelines using our measurements on how to select the most suitable PHY mode based on specific application requirements.

In contrast to existing BLE beacon-based proximity applications that can only show coarse-grained (immediate, near, and far) distance estimation, LocBLE's fine-grained estimation can enhance human-environment interactions. LocBLE has three salient features in estimating location from BLE beacon signals. First, it is adaptive to dynamic signal propagation environments by learning the environmental changes directly from the received signal strength (RSS). Second, it performs sensor-fusion for location estimation by utilizing motion sensor data and RSS readings from a smartphone. Finally, LocBLE improves location tracking accuracy with novel on-line calibration on a set of beacons nearby. We have built a prototype of LocBLE on smartphones and evaluated it on commodity proximity-enabled beacons. Our experimental results demonstrate that LocBLE achieves an average of 1.8m and 1.2m accuracies in locating indoor and outdoor BLE beacons, respectively.

The traffic monitoring tasks are performed by analyzing strength of radio signal received by mobile devices from beacons that are placed on opposite sides of a road. This approach is suitable for crowd sourcing applications aimed at reducing travel time, congestion, and emissions. Advantages of the introduced method were demonstrated during experimental evaluation in real-traffic conditions. Results of the experimental evaluation confirm that the proposed solution is effective in detecting three classes of vehicles (personal cars, semitrucks, and trucks). Extensive experiments were conducted to test different classification approaches and data aggregation methods. In comparison with state-of-the-art RSSI-based vehicle detection methods, higher accuracy was achieved by introducing a dedicated ensemble of random forest classifiers with majority voting.

The proposed framework supports various kinds of end-devices. It provides the ability to remotely control the end-devices over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It is able to automatically perform the appropriate actions based on user-predefined scenarios. The most advantage of the proposed framework is runtime configurable without any needs of reprogramming or resetting the whole system.

In this article we show how this effort can be reduced by automating the configuration of new wireless devices, based on their location. This technique is useful in e.g. home automation systems where a light switch needs to be paired with the light fixtures. To show how our system works, we have implemented a demonstrator application based on Bluetooth Low Energy. We assume that each room contains a beacon node that holds the settings for that room. Based on the RSSI in the BLE advertisements of those node, a new node can detect in which room it is deployed and update its own settings accordingly. A node can do this correctly in 96% of the case. To improve the reliability, a node can ask the user to confirm its position, whenever there is doubt. This happens in 12% of the cases, resulting in 100% correct localizations.

There are many applications using this technology already available on the market. These products are classified as personal applications while using the BLE-supported tablets or smartphones for transmitting data and are not institutional. There are numerous studies showing that the number of IoT sensors and devices will increase rapidly. However, personal approaches cannot manage a large number of devices. In this study, a BLE gateway device which interconnects BLE and WiFi networks was developed. This device is also capable of transmitting IoT node information to a server or cloud on the Internet. The proposed design uses only BLE and WiFi stack chips and does not require an additional microcontroller unit for running gateway applications. This makes the design cost-effective and power efficient, which are important for the IoT environment.

They facilitate connections between citizens and organizations that are of paramount importance for their long-term sustainability. As cities become more complex and their communities more dispersed, questions such as ' where can I find...' are increasingly pertinent. In this paper, we introduce NomaBlue, a new vision of spatial recognition in smart cities, the proposed system is based on an intelligent nomadic data collection and users ' collaboration using smart Bluetooth technology. We demonstrate using two case-studies that our approach is capable of proposing an efficient spatial recognition service while supporting a range of users ' constraints, our system is disconnected from the internet, it can operate in any indoor/outdoor area, it doesn't require pre-defined geographic databases and uses a new concept of nomadic data collection and sharing to speed-up the circulating information in smart cities.

Hence, the intelligent method that makes it possible to perceive and differentiate the energy-saving efforts is required to achieve high efficiency. According to the proposed method, the occupants' efforts to reduce energy consumption can be differentiated and estimated intelligently in a context-aware manner.

There currently needs to be a generally accepted standard method for indoor positioning. In this study, an ecosystem consisting of Beacon devices, Bluetooth intelligent devices, and Wi-Fi access points has been created to propose an effective indoor location determination method by using Wi-Fi and BLE technologies in a hybrid way. First, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) data were collected using the fingerprint method. Then, Kalman Filter and Savitzky Golay Filter are used in a hybrid manner to reduce the noise on the obtained signal data and make it more stable. In the first part, using the collected data fromWi-Fi and Beacon devices, the Non-linear least squares method (NLLS), including Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), is used for indoor tracking. In the second part, a fingerprinting-based approach is tested. K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms estimate the area where the client is located. Each algorithm's accuracy rate are calculated on different training and test data and presented.	[Haznedar, Yunus; Aydin, G.

In the field of wireless sensor net, to apply low-power consumption Bluetooth could decrease the cost of system and reduce the devices' volume, especially lower the power consumption. Based on Bluetooth Low Energy, this paper proposes a wireless sensor net integrate program and designs a key node in the wireless sensor net to reduce the node's volume and decrease the energy consumption. Through testing we found that the system could transfer the data which were collected by the sensors to the node by low-energy consumption Bluetooth. Due to its low cost and easy operation, the system is suitably applied to rigid monitoring systems such as military, industry, medical treatment, agriculture or life.

It has been demonstrated in the literature that CRC can also be used to correct transmission errors. In this paper, we propose an improvement of the state-of-the-art CRC-based error correction method. The proposed approach is designed to significantly increase the error correction capabilities of the previous method, by handling a greater part of error cases through the management of candidate lists and using additional validations. Simulations and results for wireless video communications over 802.11p and Bluetooth Low Energy illustrate the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and visual quality gains achieved with the proposed approach versus the state-of-the-art and traditional approaches. These gains range on average from 1.6 dB to 7.3 dB over Bluetooth Low Energy channels with Eb/No ratio of 10 dB and 8 dB, respectively.

Most of the existing ECG device have the disadvantage of either poor local signal processing ability or heavily rely on the signal processing ability of remote server. After thorough investigation, Android platform is adopted to develop an ECG signal processing application for real-time arrhythmia classification and HRV analysis. The ECG data acquired with a wearable ECG sensor are transmitted to the Android smart phone or tablet via BLE (Bluetooth low energy). Computing intensive signal processing tasks were implemented in C code with Android NDK (Native Development Kit) technology. The user account information and analysis results can also be transmitted to the remote server through the HTTP protocol if needed.

Considering the consumer electronic market, one of the main adopted wireless network protocols is Bluetooth and, nowadays, the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) version. Therefore, the development of new services that interact with BLE-enabled devices is an interest topic for IoT. Specially when considering BLE-enabled devices that uses GATT protocol for communication. In this paper is proposed a solution based on the use of a flow-based programming tool, Node-RED, that allows data provided by BLE-GATT devices to be available to Internet services in an easy to implement way using widely used protocols, such as MQTT. Also, regarding interoperability between devices, it is proposed the use of oneIoTa data model to allow standardized communication between BLE devices and Internet services. Therefore, the presented solution should easier the integration of BLE devices with Internet services, and keep interoperability using a public data model.

In this paper, we are investigating the potential impact of BLE devices broadcasting availability and what are the differences according to different real environment broadcasting scenarios. By means of experiments, we conduct several scenarios depending on two variables - duration of device advertising and a number of advertising devices. We found that the duration of advertisement is not affecting message delivery when the advertiser is alone in the network. Also, we predict future growth of network latency. We found that this behaviour is happening in the case when devices are in a closer range of advertising.

For instance, Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-based data transmission scheme and sensor-based energy management scheme.

A wake-up receiver system was developed from off-the-shelf components to detect these packets. It makes use of two differential signal paths separated by passive band-pass filters. After the rectification of each channel a differential amplifier compares the signals and the resulting wake-up signal is evaluated by an AS3933 wake-up receiver IC. Overall, the combination of these techniques contributes to a BLE compatible wake-up system which is more robust than traditional OOK wake-up systems. Thus, increasing wake-up range, while still maintaining a low energy budget. The proof-of-concept setup achieved a sensitivity of -47.8 dBm at a power consumption of 18.5 uW during passive listening. The system has a latency of 31.8 ms with a symbol rate of 1437 Baud.

For fingerprinting, we obtained both a received signal strength indication and a signal observation frequency that were obtained from nearby beacons. The location was estimated from both a presurveilled profile and an exponential fit model. When using an exponential fit model with the signal observation frequency, we were able to achieve approximately 80% accuracy, even with little data.

Bluetooth LE is a rapidly emerging ultra-low-power radio technology expected to be incorporated in billions of IoT devices in the next few years. Consequently, it is particularly important to specify Internet connectivity solutions for Bluetooth LE. In this article we present such solutions based on the ongoing standardization work in the IETF and Bluetooth Special Interest Group. We prove the feasibility of a complete IP-based protocol stack on constrained devices and illustrate its performance, highlighting key trade-offs.

To meet the requirements of diverse IoT applications, the neighbor discovery process (NDP) in BLE networks requires low cost and low latency, which is one of the most challenging tasks in supporting such a large number of BLE devices. Since the choice of BLE parameters is essential for achieving the required performance of BLE NDP, many performance analysis models have been proposed, aiming to provide guidance for the parameter configuration in IoT applications. This article reviews and studies the BLE NDP models and BLE performance analysis models proposed over the period 2012-2020, considering the advantages and constraints in utilizing these models in IoT. The performance analysis models are divided into two categories: 1) probabilistic models and 2) Chinese reminder theory-based models. The model design, performance metrics, deployment constraints, analysis results, and use cases are discussed for research, development, and applications.

In this work, an optimized indoor positioning approach using BLE for detecting a smart device's location in an indoor environment is proposed. The first stage of the proposed approach is a calibration stage for initialization. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is collected and pre-processed for a stable outcome, in the second stage. Then the distance is estimated by using the processed RSSI and calibrated factors in the third stage. The final stage is the position estimation using the outputs from the previous steps. The positioning technique, which is an improved Least Square estimation is evaluated against the other well-known techniques such as, Trilateration-Centroid, classic Least Square Estimation in estimating the user's location in the 2D plane. Experimental results show that our proposed approach has promising results by achieving an accuracy of positioning within 0.2 to 0.35m.

One of the added features is an automatic addressing when a new node is added to the system. The process of addressing wired nodes is straightforward. However, problems arise when large amounts of wireless Bluetooth Low Energy nodes must be dealt with. There are limitations that come from the hardware side, due to having three layers of architecture. It can be described as an evaluated bipartite graph. A proposal for how to deal with the address assignment problem is presented and the best fit is selected for future implementation. It is shown that complete task automation is not possible, and user interventions will be necessary. Finally, the technology requirements for the software plugin features so as to allow comfortably solving the presented issues are described.

In this paper, a novel denoising autoencoder-based BLE indoor localization (DABIL) method is proposed to provide high-performance 3-D positioning in large indoor places. A deep learning model, called denoising autoencoder, is adopted to extract robust fingerprint patterns from received signal strength indicator measurements, and a fingerprint database is constructed with reference locations in 3-D space, rather than traditional 2-D plane. Field experiments show that 3-D space fingerprinting can effectively increase positioning accuracy, and DABIL performs the best in terms of both horizontal accuracy and vertical accuracy, comparing with a traditional fingerprinting method and a deep learning-based method. Moreover, it can achieve stable performance with incomplete beacon measurements due to unpredictable BLE beacon lost.

The performance of the proposed system, using false negative rate, false alarm rate, and alarm response time as indicators, is compared with that of the system using Quuppa as a positioning source. The experiment results show that both BLE pseudolite and Quuppa as a positioning source can basically meet the positioning accuracy for the infant monitoring system, but the BLE-pseudolite-based system provides a more cost-efficient solution.

The state-of-the-art systems include a large number of complex hardware structures and algorithms making the system not suitable for practical applications. In this paper, we integrate a localisation system that consists of device development, model deployment, data collection and localisation algorithm to explore the localisation accuracy in a special static indoor environment (i.e. a meeting room or a parking lot). Compared with previous studies, the significance of our work is to find out a more convenient and practical way to deploy devices with a simple algorithm (e.g. machine learning algorithm) in such a scenario. Besides, it is meaningful to explore the technology of indoor localisation based on the application scenario. We propose a Grid-Loc system that presents a grid structure of Bluetooth low-energy devices to collect data assisting localisation. The system is easy to deploy for reducing the signal attenuation caused by the objects' occlusion. Meanwhile, the system applies an algorithm that combines adaptive boosting with a support vector machine algorithm to support the system. In our deployed localisation scenario, we also compare localisation performances for several algorithms; the result shows the Grid-Loc system achieves the accuracy of 91.2%, computing time within 3 s in real time and a low cost. The system is also robust and scalable under the same indoor environments.

Today most of the smartphones are enabled with BLE. Mobile identity applications allow people to use a mobile phone as a form of secure digital identity (ID) card for identification purposes. In this paper, we present a novel transferring method for identity data such as electronic passport or other identification document data between two mobile devices, i.e. mobile identity holder and reader, over a BLE channel and propose the definition of a new GATT (Generic Attributes) profile suitable for mobile identity applications. Using the proposed approach we show that BLE based process simplifies and speeds up mobile identity data exchange for multiple use cases.

Wireless positioning is a key enabler for location based services and many research papers have been published for indoor positioning using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZIGBEE, IR etc. The published research suggests that position of wireless beacon can be determined based on the time of arrival and the measured signal strength. But, the margins of error in the calculated value using the published formulae, negatively impacts the efficacy of most indoor positioning applications. This paper recommends methods to improve the accuracy of the calculated value when using Bluetooth LE technology Methods used for Indoor positioning as compared to Outdoor positioning need to handle attenuation factors such as Multipath fading, diffraction, reflection etc. These become especially critical for short ranges of similar to 3m which is the general range of influence for a display unit. Hence, modelling a very short range Path Loss Prediction becomes imperative. This paper proposes a new Path Loss model for very short range between 10-12 ft with better accuracy and miniscule error rate.

A reliable, low-cost and accurate solution that does not require an active device at the target has not been found yet. In this work, we tackle this challenge by proposing a pattern recognition method based on supervised learning models. This method classifies passive fingerprints that represent the influence of a target's position on the field strength distribution into possible locations within the test area. The method leverages the ability of an optimized custom BLE sensor platform for IoT applications. A smart feature extraction is then proposed and the data is fed to supervised machine learning models such as KNN and SVM. It will be shown based on experimental results and descriptive statistics that passive localization of a target can be carried out robustly and the median error of the proposed method is 0.67 m.

However, in research using packets sent by such devices, if the MAC addresses are randomized, then a problem is that it is not possible to know which packet was sent by which experimental device. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying BLE devices with randomized MAC addresses without using device-specific values. Experimental evaluations using BLE packets from a real application show that the proposed method can identify MAC addresses with an accuracy of up to 98% when there are 20 devices.

In this paper, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) device-based networks were used to monitor the movement and location of workers; this was followed by analysis of the location data to evaluate worker performance. The network uses a BLE tag as the "tracked" device. The system was implemented at a construction site. Measurement data shows it has a location accuracy in the range of 5-10 m depending on the positioning of the receiver gateway.

Textile-based Capacitive Sensor for a Wireless Wearable Breath Monitoring System	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (ICCE)	IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)	JAN 10-13, 2014	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE		abdominal breathing; Bluetooth low-energy; mobility; textile-based sensor		A capacitive sensor is demonstrated as the key component of a wearable breath monitoring system. Its capacitance varies proportional to the pressure acting on it with high linearity and wide working range. All of the components of the sensor, including conductors, insulator, and conductive wires, are textile materials and are thus as soft as ordinary clothes; therefore, the sensor is also washable and durable. By installing one sensor on the chest and another on the lower abdomen, thoracic and abdominal breathing can be detected independently with little crosstalk. Driven by a low-power NE556 oscillator, the capacitances of both sensors can be detected digitally and then transmitted by a Bluetooth low-energy wireless communication module to a smartphone. Thus, a wearable breath monitoring system is implemented to provide continuous and real time breath signal monitoring without mobility constraints.(1)	[Yang, C. M.; Yang, T. L.; Wu, C.

In many universities in Malaysia, students' attendance need to be tracked and become one of the requirements for a student to pass a subject. Common approach of attendance taking is using paper based attendance. Besides that, RFID technology becoming commonly used to replace the paper based attendance taking method. In this study, a smart attendance system using Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacon (UniSas) is proposed and implemented in Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN). Further, the performance (accuracy, time-consumption and energy-consumption) of the paper-based attendance, RFID attendance system and UniSas are compared.

However, the Wi-Fi access nodes (WFAN) are fixed and cannot provide the same signal strength to every covered region. The signal strength for some regions are poor. Hence, it is difficult to solve the poor signal strengths in some regions. This paper proposes a manager device that can utilize both positions of the indoor positioning monitor device and the WFAN in our experiment environment. We use BLE beacons to achieve our indoor positioning and implement a movable device to carry the WFAN. On basis of the results, our system can judge current WFAN's position and move to appropriate positon in the indoor environment. In our experiments, the calculated position and actual position of our manager device have average differences of 0.807 m, respectively. Our manager device can order the WFAN to move to appropriate position that is based on the positions of the other environment devices and provide better wireless access quality.

With these devices, indoor positioning techniques have been extensively researched. However, the positioning precision, using a single Wi-Fi or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) device, is usually limited to several meters. To improve positioning precision, we propose an approach of fingerprinting using multiple wearable BLE devices. In the initial experiments, we noticed that body obstruction leads to different signal strengths when a person with a wearable device turns around. On this basis, we further build directional maps for fingerprinting and study the potential combination of multiple devices in positioning. The experimental results in two indoor scenarios confirm that using multiple devices and directional maps help to greatly improve positioning precision to the decimeter level (more specifically 0.07m). The impact of BLE beacon density is also investigated.

With the proliferation of BLE-embedded IoT devices, it is important to study the security and privacy implications of BLE. The forefront attack to BLE devices is the wireless sniffing attack, which would lead to more detrimental threats like jamming, encryption cracking or system penetration. Existing sniffing attacks are based on the correct detection of BLE connection initiation state, but they become ineffective for BLE long-lived connections. In this paper, we focus on the adversary setting with a low-cost single radio and develop a suite of real-time algorithms to determine the key parameters necessary to follow and sniff a BLE connection in the connected state. We implement our algorithms in the open source platform -Ubertooth One and evaluate its performance in terms of sniffing overhead and accuracy. By comparing with state-of-the-art schemes, experimental results show that our sniffer achieves much higher sniffing accuracy (over 80%) and better stability to BLE operational dynamics.

This paper focuses on achieving unambiguous user positioning using practical Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons with multiple discrete power levels. By receiving the beacon coverage status from a user's device, the cloud server can unambiguously pinpoint the user's location and react correspondingly. We first define the problem of beacon deployment for positioning (BDP) and provide several theoretic bounds on the number of required beacons to gain sufficient understanding on its performance behavior. The BDP problem is further formulated into an integer linear program (ILP) and solved in extensive case studies. We claim that this is the first systematic and in-depth research on beacon deployment for unambiguous user positioning. Our analysis and experiments show that the proposed solution takes O(root N) to O(N/2) beacons for N test positions, which is 2-8 times less beacons compared to that by the naive approach, while the analytical bounds are tight with the ILP results with 20% of gap.

Under such a situation, the deaf people are hard to get information because a lot of emergency information is delivered by sound. For them, information by vision is more suitable. We developed information delivery system with Bluetooth Low Energy. In this paper, we analyzed packet reaching rate with three nodes hopped and checked the behavior of routing function and discuss the performance of an ad-hoc network with BLE Advertisement. The performance includes the reachability of transmitted packets, the routability of the routing protocol we developed and the power consumption of BLE. The reachability is important because emergency information must reach at high rate. The routability is also important because nodes move and routes of one node to another node should quickly updated. The low power consumption of BLE is further important because nodes like smartphones have limited battery. From these three points of view, we had investigated whether BLE advertisement is effective to carry emergency information.

A Simple Room Localization Method to Find Technology in a Big Trauma Center	WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2018, VOL 1	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IUPESM World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering	JUN 03-08, 2018	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	CSBMEMI, Czech Assoc Med Physicists, Varian, RaySearch Labs, Elekta, Int Union Phys & Engn Sci Med, Czech Med Assoc J E Purkyne, Int Org Med Phys, Int Federat Med & Biol Engn		Indoor localization; Medical emergency; Bluetooth low energy		Trauma Center is a big operating theatre of over 4000 m(2) on two floors and 14 operating rooms. In this context, the share of the equipment is fundamental to reduce expedition but may cause an excessive loss of time by medical staff that needs devices for the clinical therapy. Therefore, knowing localization is useful for health monitoring of important electromedical devices. In recent years, a lot of technologies have been developed for the indoor localization, like the Bluetooth wireless standard technology. In particular, Beacon technology is very interesting, which uses the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology. However, due to the complexity of internal ambiences, the development of an indoor localization method is always associated with various problems, mainly for the presence of obstacles among the direction of propagation of signals. Application of BLE for the localization of medical equipment could help to save time during an emergency. With this preliminary study, using Beacon devices like tag, three mathematical average methods for reducing variability in indoor localization techniques are performed. Although mathematic average methods can reduce variability, it is very difficult to eliminate the calculation error of the tag-reader distance. Nevertheless, in this preliminary analysis the mathematical method using the average of RSSI measures present a constant error pattern, along distances, ranged between 0 and 8 m not too big for a room localization method.

Although the cost of the BLE components is decreasing, the installation costs remain high. When many BLE devices are installed, determination of the locations for installation, referred to as the configuration, becomes complicated and labor intensive. In this research, we investigate computational methods for configuring BLE devices in a given region. We propose a computation method using k-means method and present numerical results. We then evaluate the proposed method in terms of the number of generation points and the number of BLE devices to be installed. We also introduce a measure for the configuration.

Rather than advertising a URL to load a web page, the FatBeacon protocol has the ability to broadcast any basic web contents actually hosted on the device. In particular, FatBeacons are here used to improve the tourist experience in places with no Internet coverage through a new application of the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to the fact that the web content is emitted by the own FatBeacon, any smartphone with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can be used to receive touristic information, even in uncovered areas, such as rural or mountain destinations. This work does not only show the applicability of the new FatBeacon protocol, but it also presents a performance comparison of different BLE technologies used for similar touristic applications.

When the transmitted BLE signal is passed through the human tissue (fingertip), the proposed non-invasive measurement system uses the power level of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the received BLE signal to identify the blood glucose level. The novel measurement technique for the non-invasive blood glucose monitoring using RSSI of the BLE signal, allows the prototype to be used in wearable form factor while making it affordable and reliable, something not reported in the past. Oral Glucose Tolerant Test (OGTT) have been performed on fasting human subjects by the intake of 50 gm glucose solution. Concurrent measurements of the proposed non-invasive techniques and conventional invasive blood pricking were executed for correlation. The temporal trend observed on OGTT protocol from the proposed non-invasive measurement and the invasing blood pricking strongly correlates, validating the clinical significance of the proposed affordable and wearable prototype.

The solution developed is based on spreading emitter beacons of Bluetooth Low Energy in the building and use location finding techniques to determine the robot's location. The main challenge is the capacity to obtain accurate readings of signal strength and the low repeatability of readings even under unchanged conditions. To improve the signal strength measurements it is necessary to deal with this imprecision. Our approach is based on the use of Fuzzy Logic to deal with the accuracy problem. Once better signal strength readings are achieved, using this method, approximate distances are calculated based on signal strength and the trilateration method is implemented to provide the location of the mobile robot.

From technical and economical points of view, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the promising technologies in this field. This paper deals with the study of performances of this technology for these purposes. For the indoor localization, a received signal strength indication (RSSI) method is used. It was tested in ideal (anechoic chamber) and real (in the office) environment conditions. For the measurement campaign and evaluation of the obtained results a generic framework is proposed. Experimental results (simulation vs. measurement) show similar behaviour of the BLE technology in ideal (no signal reflection) and real (multipath propagation) transmission environments.

This feature will include a scheme for audio broadcasting in public areas and in homes and office environments. However, this technology has only employed an n-repetition scheme for the broadcast method. In this scheme, the energy efficiency of the master device, which generally broadcasts audio data in cycles, can be increasingly aggravated owing to unnecessary retransmissions, even if the radio channel is not congested. To provide a solution, in this paper, an energy detection-based broadcast scheme is proposed using an appropriate analysis model based on a stochastic method to find the optimal retransmission number, where heterogeneous Wi-Fi communications coexist on the same 2.4-GHz band. The evaluation is also presented, wherein the experimental results are compared to the standard n-repetition scheme in the same environment.

Cardiac monitoring and screening technologies like Electrocardiography (ECG) need to be moved out from within the confines of hospital walls to places within easy reach of the wider mass of the countrys population; through remote deployment in primary care centers and homes. Affordability, accuracy and deep penetration are key to the success of any envisaged solution. The accuracy of reports generated by a remotely deployed ECG monitor primarily depend on the accuracy of the actual hardware making the measurement, and can be guaranteed by choosing any of the time tested bio-potential measurement ICs. The penetration however depends on the technology deployed for remote access of the ECG device. This technology must have the potential to be easily integrated into the minimal networking infrastructure existing in the rural areas and hinterlands of the country. A combination of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cellular networks, utilizing a smartphone, supporting minimum features, as a common access point is a promising solution for remotely accessing an ECG monitor deployed in rural areas. The challenge however is in developing methods to reliably transmit ECG data over both the BLE link and cellular networks meeting all the QoS requirements of medical standard ECG monitoring application. In this paper we first list out a set of QoS requirements for ECG monitoring application, drawn from discussions with cardiologists and from studying existing literature. We then explore the feasibility of a BLE link meeting these requirements, with supporting results from tests performed with a prototype which we developed.

J	Ng, PC; She, J				Ng, Pai Chet; She, James			Denoising-Contractive Autoencoder for Robust Device-Free Occupancy Detection	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Autoencoder; Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon; occupancy detection	LOCALIZATION; IOT	Device-free occupancy detection is very important for certain Internet of Things applications that do not require the user to carry a receiver. This paper achieves the device-free occupancy detection with RF fingerprinting, which labels each zone with a 2M-dimensional fingerprint vector. Specifically, the fingerprint vector consists of received signal strength (RSS) values measured from M Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and also their corresponding temporal RSS variations. However, the unreliable RSS values caused two common issues with the fingerprint vector: 1) noise and 2) sparsity. To this end, we propose denoising-contractive autoencoder (DCAE) to jointly deal with these two issues, by learning a robust fingerprint prior to device-free occupancy detection. We validate the performance of our proposed DCAE with large-scale real-world datasets. The experimental results indicate the substantial performance gain of our proposed DCAE in comparison with state-of-the-art autoencoders. In particular, the classifier trained using the fingerprints learned by our proposed DCAE is able to maintain at least 90% accuracy when the noise factor or sparsity ratio increases to 0.6 and 0.5, respectively.

LoRaWAN adopts the MAC protocol is based on Pure ALOHA and the terminal can send packets at any time. However, the problem is that packet collisions frequently occur as the number of terminals increases. On the other hand, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is standardized for short-distance communication for IoT is now widely used in various IoT devices because it enables high speed and stable communication. Therefore, we proposed a method that can reduce the traffic on the LoRaWAN by dynamically selecting LoRaWAN and BLE when the terminals move in an environment where it can use both systems. However, it is necessary to consider the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements which are the application requirements of the terminal because LoRaWAN and BLE is standardized supposed different target applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that can adaptively select a system by weighting the QoS realizations of each system such as the packet error rate predicted using the spectrum database and the power consumption during communication with the application requirements of the terminal.

To Enable the wide range of IoT use cases, several communication technologies are introduced. Among the others, short range radio technology is an essential part of IoT for enabling the local area networks. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) version 5 is recently developed by Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) which claims to be better suit for IoT use cases. However, the complexity of BLE 5 protocol and the lack of system-level simulator hinder the detailed analytical study of this new technology. To this end, we develop comprehensive system-level tool for simulating BLE 5. Some of the most important features of BLE 5 are developed and results are investigated in this paper. We investigate the BLE 5 with new physical (PHY) layer from networking perspective by analyzing end-to-end delay, battery life time, packet error rate and throughput in open office environment. To this end, we investigate the scalability of the network for different PHYs. The results show that, in this case study, the coded PHYs have weaker performance when network becomes congested.

In the system, the user is localized primarily based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements of BLE signals. The UWB part of the system is periodically used to improve localization accuracy by supplying the algorithm with measured UWB packets time difference of arrival (TDOA). The proposed scheme was experimentally validated using two algorithms: the EKF and the UKF. The localization accuracy of both algorithms is compared.

Monitoring and fault diagnosis strategies can then be applied. A battery or an energy harvesting system charging a rechargeable battery typically powers IoT devices. The energy harvesting unit and rechargeable battery supply the sensors and wireless communications modules. Therefore, the energy harvesting unit must be correctly sized to optimize the availability and reliability of IoT devices. This paper applies a power balance of the entire IoT device, including the energy harvesting module that includes two thermoelectric generators and a DC-DC converter, the battery, and the sensors and communication modules. Due to the small currents typical of the different communication phases and their fast-switching nature, it is not trivial to measure the energy in each phase, requiring very specific instrumentation. This work shows that using conventional instrumentation it is possible to measure the energy involved in the different modes of communication. A detailed energy balance of the battery is also carried out during charge and discharge cycles, as well as communication modes, from which the maximum allowable data transfer rate is determined. The approach presented here can be generalized to many other smart grid IoT devices.

In this work, an architecture for real-time tracking using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and iBeacons in hospitals is proposed. The proposed system is to locate not only humans but also other facilities such as medicines. It consists of four different frameworks: server communication, user interaction, cross-platform communication and indoor localization. A wearable BLE-enabled device or any smartphone can be used in our system. The first stage of the tracking system is setting up and calibrating the BLE iBeacons for initialization. Then the Received Signal Strength is collected from the BLEenabled devices carried by users. These data are analyzed and calculated using our improved Least Square Estimation approach to estimate the actual location of users. Experimental results show that in a crowded environment, our tracking system achieves resolutions of the order of 12cm. This will be further integrated with other sensors such as accelerometer or heart rate monitor to improve the real-time healthcare monitoring experience.

Within the SSI model, a digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a secure and trusted manner. However, in order to perform various operations such as messaging and credential exchange, these usually require internet access. In some situations, this is not possible, and entities should be able to communicate independently of any external infrastructure in an offline setting. The objective of this paper is to design a proof-of-concept that would allow for secure, trustworthy, and privacy-preserving decentralized peer-to-peer communication without the need for any external networking infrastructure. For this, we investigate a particular case involving DIDComm and Bluetooth LE. We identify requirements for the architecture and propose an architectural framework that allows two entities to securely communicate. To show our concept's feasibility, we evaluate the existing technologies that could be used in the proposed architecture. Our findings indicate that this approach has the potential to enable a wide range of interesting use cases and can be integrated into existing digital identity wallet solutions to extend the capabilities of offline messaging in a secure and decentralized manner that goes beyond the current models that often rely on Internet connectivity.

The LE device could produce health vital signs as a fruitful data source for further analytic process. However, sending continuous data is not recommended due to limited power and computation resources on the smartphone. Thus, the BLE framework for desktop applications was developed. Nevertheless, compatibility becomes an issue in the developing system which interacts with LE devices. This study conducted an evaluation and experiment with existing BLE frameworks which are Core Bluetooth and PyGATT. Two programs that represent each BLE framework was developed and Polar H10 used as an LE sensor device.

Contact Tracing Apps aid people in COVID-19 infection prevention. Our proposed work focuses on developing a Contact Tracing App named CT-19 using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When users run CT-19 App on their smartphone, it broadcasts and records unique private key along with private keys broadcasted from nearby smartphones. When a patient is informed that he/she has COVID-19 infection, the health authority uploads private key from their phone to a central server (only with the consent of patient). Periodically central server broadcasts these keys to all the users who has installed CT-19 App. Once broadcasted keys are received, CT-19 App checks whether any already stored keys match with this received broadcasted key. If it matches, then it implies that user was in physical proximity to an infected individual. Based on this information user can take some precautionary steps like undergoing COVID-19 tests/quarantine. When a user runs an app on his/her smartphone, user privacy is extremely crucial. Our proposed app CT-19 protects user privacy by neither capturing nor keeping the user's GPS or phone number.	[Satyam, Deepak; Maheswari, B.

As one of the LBS, the indoor positioning system (IPS) has become a research hotspot. Bluetooth technology has become one of the preferred indoor localization technologies due to its low cost and convenient installation. At present, most Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based localization methods use fingerprinting approach. However, in the presence of large-scale BLE sensors, the traditional fingerprinting approach will take up a lot of computing resources or even can not be calculated. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of mobile devices will also affect the localization accuracy. In this paper, we designed a dynamic selector to solve the problems caused by large-scale BLE sensors, and a dynamic weighted nearest neighbor (DWNN) indoor localization algorithm was proposed. Experiments show that the indoor localization method proposed in this paper designs a dynamic selector to solve the problem of large-scale BLE sensors. In addition, the device heterogeneity has been solved and higher localization accuracy has been achieved.

In low power ad-hoc networks, radios are duty-cycled and the latency until a packet meets a reception phase of another device is determined by a random process. Most research considers slotted protocols, in which the points in time for reception are temporally coupled to beacon transmissions. In contrast, many recent protocols, such as ANT/ANT+ and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) use a slotless, periodic-interval based scheme for neighbor discovery. Here, one device periodically broadcasts packets, whereas the other device periodically listens to the channel. Both periods are independent from each other and drawn over continuous time. Such protocols provide 3 degrees of freedom (viz., the intervals for advertising and scanning and the duration of each scan phase). Though billions of existing BLE devices rely on these protocols, neither their expected latencies nor beneficial configurations with good latency-duty-cycle relations are known. Parametrizations for the participating devices are usually determined based on a "good guess". In this paper, we, for the first time, present a mathematical theory which can compute the neighbor discovery latencies for all possible parametrizations. Further, our theory shows that upper bounds on the latency can be guaranteed for all parametrizations, except for a finite number of singularities. Therefore, slotless, periodic interval-based protocols can be used in applications with deterministic latency demands, which have been reserved for slotted protocols until now. Our proposed theory can be used for analyzing the neighbor discovery latencies, for tweaking protocol parameters and for developing new protocols.

However, beacon deployments remain rare. In this paper we introduce Bellrock, a framework that repurposes static personal devices (phones, laptops, etc.) as proximity beacons without revealing the location of the device owners, and provides conventional beacons with access control. This is done by using mutable pseudo-anonymous identifiers that can be unmasked by a cloud service. We develop Bellrock as a general framework, describing the repurposing scheme and the anonymisation techniques, before applying it to Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. We implement and demonstrate the scalability of the de-anonymisation server, which uses a series of heuristics. We implement a Bellrock client on Android and demonstrate negligible impact on battery lifetime. We evaluate Bellrock using extensive real-world office worker movements. We find that Bellrock was able to provide proximity locations for 8,542 of the 21,796 failed locations that would have occurred without it. We further find that office workers were in range of one or more of their co-workers over 90% of the time, indicating Bellrock can provide relative proximity information even in the absence of a conventional beacon deployment. Overall, we find that Bellrock is both feasible and practical, providing a beacon deployment where there was none, or supplementing existing deployments.

They can also be very useful in medical applications, as an individual's indoor movements can be indicative of his/her clinical status. Research for indoor localization systems is ongoing and there are numerous solutions with different hardware or algorithmic approaches, for different use cases. Ease of setup and cost are significant factors when using indoor localization systems for medical applications. This paper proposes an indoor localization system with room-level accuracy, focusing on an easy installation procedure that can be easily followed from non-technical staff, as well as on low cost, so that it can be widely adopted. The proposed system has been mainly designed for behavioural monitoring of adults in an indoor environment. The system operates by tracking a carried device based on the processing of RSS (Received Signal Strength) measurements from Bluetooth Low Energy beacons placed in the area. The proposed system has been evaluated in realistic settings and and achieves an accuracy of 95.31% in room estimation.

Researchers aim to improve the indoor positioning system's performance by proposing algorithms using the supervised learning method, particularly the K-nearest-neighbors-based (KNN-based) fingerprinting method. This research focuses on studying the indoor localization system's precision using Bluetooth low-energy Received Signal Strength (BLE-RSS) fingerprinting for static scenarios. In the scenario, we use the traditional offline phase to collect the BLE RSSI data and then estimate the user's position in the online phase based on on-the-fly RSSI measurement and data from the offline phase. In real-world experiments, the system's performance has been evaluated in many scenarios to determine the optimal value, such as the value of K in KNN algorithm, and the number of beacons that need to be deployed.

These peripheral devices include not only firmware-defined bare-metal peripherals but also mobile application defined peripherals where a mobile app turns a smartphone into a peripheral instead of their usual central role. However, this role reversal increases the attack surface and brings vulnerabilities in bare-metal Bluetooth peripherals to mobile apps where relevant security and privacy have not been well studied. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents PeriScope, an automated tool to unveil the security and privacy vulnerabilities at the link layer of app-defined Bluetooth peripherals in the procedures of broadcasting, pairing, and communication by systematically analyzing their companion mobile apps. PeriScope has analyzed 1,160 Bluetooth peripheral apps from Google Play and identified 69.13% of them that broadcast device or personal identifiable information in cleartext, and, in addition, there are 95% pieces of data managed by these apps (e.g., personal health data and digital keys to unlock doors) to exchange with connected devices can be accessed without authentication. Finally, a set of guidelines for secure app-defined Bluetooth peripherals development is also provided.

A wide range of indoor positioning algorithms have been developed for various applications. In this work a new hybrid indoor location positioning technique is presented which utilizes smartphones and low cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags without any further infrastructure. The proposed method supports centimeter range positioning accuracy in its fine-positioning mode. The method includes coarse and fine location positioning. In the coarse positioning mode, a solution using received signal strength is employed while in the fine positioning mode an acoustic positioning technique is utilized. To ensure a high accuracy, the positioning system uses multilateration algorithm where only time synchronization between audio receivers is required. Experimental results using a commercially available BLE tags indicate that the proposed method, can determine indoor locations with less than 5 centimeters accuracy even in a noisy environment.

Beacons can be used to provide a tailored user experience with each encounter, yet can also constitute an invasion of privacy, due to their covertness and ability to track user behavior. Therefore, we hypothesize that user-driven privacy policy configuration is key to enabling effective and trustworthy privacy management during beacon encounters. We developed a framework for beacon privacy management that provides a policy configuration platform. Through an empirical analysis with 90 users, we evaluated this framework through a proof-of-concept app called BEACON PRIVACY MANAGER (BPM), which focused on the user experience of such a tool. Using BPM, we provided users with the ability to create privacy policies for beacons, testing different configuration schemes to refine the framework and then offer recommendations for future research.

This paper presents an experimental investigation of the indoor positioning algorithms based on the signal strength received from the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We have implemented and compared several positioning algorithms (Proximity Localization, Centroid Localization, Weighted Centroid Localization, Weight-Compensated Weighted Centroid Localization Based on RSSI, Fingerprinting and Trilateration Localization). We also proposed and implemented a fuzzy logic based scheme to select the most fitting algorithm depending upon the size of the room, the number of beacons available and the strength of the signal. We have evaluated our scheme in real-world conditions (office building). The experimental results show that the algorithm of fingerprinting localization is the most suitable one. Finally, we propose a fuzzy logic system for the selection of an indoor localization algorithm based on the size of the room, the number of available beacons, and the strength of RSSI signal.

However, despite extensive research on indoor localization techniques, localization technologies are still not ready for deployment in large and complex environments such as shopping malls and hospitals, where navigation assistance is needed most. We identify six key challenges for accurate smartphone localization related to the large-scale nature of the navigation environments and the user's mobility. To address these challenges, we present a series of techniques that enhance a probabilistic localization algorithm. The algorithm utilizes mobile device inertial sensors and Received Signal Strength (RSS) from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We evaluate the proposed system in a 21,000 m(2) shopping mall that includes three multi-story buildings and a large open underground passageway. Experiments conducted in this environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technologies to improve localization accuracy. Field experiments with visually impaired participants confirm the practical performance of the proposed system in realistic use cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their low cost and robustness make them a fit choice for ambient assisted living or other healthcare applications. Nevertheless, similar to many other radio-frequency based technologies, beacons pose serious challenges when it comes to developing applications that require predictability. Moreover, the multipath propagation characteristics of Bluetooth beacons prevent ambient intelligent researchers to solely rely on using theoretical models to describe their behaviors. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bluetooth beacons behaviors. We describe the observed pattern of the signal through a series of experiments totalizing more than 3 million samples.

To alleviate this issue, this work presents WiBeacon, which repurposes ubiquitously deployed WiFi access points (AP) into virtual BLE beacons via only moderate software upgrades. Specifically, a WiBeacon-enabled AP can broadcast elaborately designed WiFi packets that could be recognized as iBeacon-compatible location identifiers by unmodified mobile BLE devices. This offers fast deployment of BLE LBS with zero additional hardware costs and low maintenance burdens. WiBeacon is carefully integrated with native WiFi services, retaining transparency to WiFi clients. We implement WiBeacon on commodity WiFi APs (with various chipsets such as Qualcomm, Broadcom, and MediaTek) and extensively evaluate it across various scenarios, including a real commercial application for courier check-ins. During the two-week pilot study, WiBeacon provides reliable services, i.e., as robust as conventional BLE beacons, for 697 users with 150 types of smartphones.

Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach does not require the installation of a mobile application and only requires the occupants to provide the MAC address of their Bluetooth-enabled smartphone devices. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated by conducting a two-week data collection effort in a university office environment where the occupancy patterns identified are used to develop various occupancy profiles for different types of occupants.

Commercial devices can provide precise and reproducible readings; however the drawbacks in size as well as spatial and temporal resolution limit their use in a number of applications. In this paper, we present complete systems of pH measurement incorporated with wireless communication. The pH sensors were developed by electrodeposition onto polymer-based gold electrodes to form the iridium oxide sensing film. The wireless schemes were achieved by using an active method via Bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) communication and a passive method via load modulation-based (LM) inductive coupling. Both approaches were validated against probe calibrations for comparisons, showing promising results. Thus, our proof-of-concept systems hold promise to be applied in numerous practical scenarios, supporting research as well as process and environmental monitoring.

Until recently, such insights have been confined to large, visible or captive animals. However, the rapid development of miniature sensors for consumer electronics is allowing ecologists to monitor the natural world in ways previously considered impossible. Here we describe miniature (<1 g) proximity loggers we have developed that use Bluetooth Low Energy transmission to register contacts between individuals. Our loggers are open source, low cost, rechargeable, able to store up to 2000 contacts, can be programmed in situ and can download data remotely or through a mobile phone application, increasing their utility in remote areas or with species which are challenging to recapture. We successfully trialled our loggers in a range of field realistic conditions, demonstrating that Bluetooth Low Energy is capable of logging associations in structurally complex habitats, and that changes in received signal strength can be equated to short range changes in distance between loggers. Furthermore, we tested the system on captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and captive multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis). The ability to include other sensors is retained in our prototypes, allowing for the potential integration of physiological and behavioural inference into social networks derived from our approach. Due to its open source nature, small size, flexibility of use and the active research currently being undertaken with Bluetooth Low Energy, our approach is a valuable addition to the biologging toolkit. Data accessibility Logging data and the R code used to download and manipulate the data will be made available as example data for R functions / R package to manipulate logger data.

It uses an optical tag scanner to read a barcode or QR-code tag that encodes the prescribed medicine and lights up the corresponding cell in the medicine cabinet. The scanning subsystem used by the pharmacist is connected to the database wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy Technology (BLE) for easy deployment. The indicator subsystem uses a novel row-column scanning circuitry to minimize the number of general-purpose input/ output (GPIO) pins that are required of the microcontroller unit (MCU) for maximum scalability and minimum hardware. Experimental results in a real pharmacy setting show the proposed system to be effective in minimizing dispensing errors while meeting cost and performance targets for commercial use.

The BLE IP system utilizing tags presents an ideal economic approach for large facilities with a limited number of tracking elements (gateways). In this investigation, data collection campaigns were conducted in an indoor facility fitted with BLE gateways to aggregate Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprints. Performance of a collection of well-known ML algorithms in tern is of accuracy of positioning of the desired objects, in addition to training complexity and online tracking speed were evaluated. ML algorithms of increased accuracy and efficiency were identified and tabulated in both of the offline and online phases. It is also envisaged that as part of this practical study, the results will serve to identify proper economical topologies and configuration in real-life installations for tag-based BLE IP systems.

A key technical challenge in achieving this goal is providing a clean and reliable estimation of location from a variety of low-cost, uncalibrated sesnors. Many current techniques rely on Particle Filter (PF) based algorithms. They have proven successful at effectively fusing various sensors inputs to create meaningful location predictions. In this paper we build upon this large corpous of work. Like prior work, our technique fuses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons with map information. A key contribution of our work is a new sensor model for BLE beacons that does not require the mapping from RSSI to distance. We further contribute a novel method of utilizing map information during the initialization of the system and during the resampling phase when new particles are generated. Using our proposed sensor model and map prior information the performance of the overall localization is improved by 1:20m on comparing the 75th percentile of the cumulative distribution with traditional localization techniques.

A 2.4-GHz, Hybrid 10-Mb/s BPSK Backscatter and 1-Mb/s FSK Bluetooth TX With Hardware Reuse	IEEE MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS COMPONENTS LETTERS			English	Article						Backscatter communication; backscatter; Bluetooth low energy (BLE); hardware reuse		This letter presents a hybrid architecture for wireless transmitters that reuses the same hardware and antenna to selectively operate in either backscatter or conventional modes, with a minimum of added complexity. A single FET stage is used as both a Class-C power amplifier for a conventional 2.4-GHz, 1-Mb/s frequency shift keying Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transmitter with peak efficiency eta approximate to 78%, as well as a 10-Mb/s BPSK modulator in an ultralow power backscatter mode. A transmitter energy consumption of 81 nJ/b at an output power level of + 14 dBm is achieved in the 1-Mb/s conventional mode, while only 32 pJ/b is required in the 10-Mb/s BPSK backscatter mode. It is shown that the data rate of the backscatter mode can be decoupled from the conventional mode, such that the backscatter link can operate at ten times the rate of the conventional link, while achieving over three orders of magnitude power savings. This approach is equally applicable to other communication standards, such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b), Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), and so on.

Our goal is not only to train a neural network that predicts the observable behavior of an automaton but also to learn its structure, including the set of states and transitions. In contrast to previous work, we constrain the training with a specific regularization term. We evaluate our approach with standard examples from the automata learning literature, but also include a case study of learning the finite-state models of real Bluetooth Low Energy protocol implementations. The results show that we can find an appropriate architecture to learn the correct automata in all considered cases.

Low cost and small form devices allow data transfer and processing without cumbersome cabling. Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), that include an accelerometer, a gyroscope and sometimes may include one magnetometer, are used to determine body movement profile. Despite their inherent inaccuracy, these sensors are used for computing three-dimensional space object orientation. These computations are usually implemented with sensor fusion algorithms within devices that have enhanced computational capabilities. This paper presents a work that aims at estimating the limb and body trunk movements of a pedaling user/patient in a bicycle like device. The presented study has been undertaken within the Exobike project. The Exobike is a bicycle like exoskeleton where the lower limbs and the trunk of a user/patient are to be monitored using IMU data transferred through a radio frequency Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. This paper focuses on the use of IMU sensors and a type of recursive filters to estimate movement profile.	[Fonseca, Joana; Ramos, Vanessa; Amaro, J.

Measurements on its wireless performance in a real residential environment with thick brick walls, demonstrate that SPW-1 can fully cover a room and - in most cases - the adjacent room, as well. SPW-1 is a research platform that is aimed to be used both as a data collecting tool for health-oriented studies outside the laboratory, but also for research on wearable technologies and body-centric communications.

We evaluate the position of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitter based on the angle of arrival (AoA) mechanism proposed by the Bluetooth standard using Software Defined Radio (SDR). The system is comprised of a phased array antenna, an analog section for the conversion of Radio Frequency (RF) signals to the baseband, followed by a digital section for AoA estimation. The experimental results validate the proposal with precise estimates and a high resolution for the AoA. The proposed approach can be used for digital beamforming to increase the operating range or decrease the level of power consumed by BLE devices in IoT applications.

Our system builds a Bluetooth Low Energy-based multi-hop communication network using smartphones. As a low-cost alternative to pile sensors, the system uses smartphones as sensor terminals to collect data. The smartphone sensors are placed in mountainous areas, which are prone to slope failures, and establish a MANET using their built-in BLE interface. If a smartphone detects ground movement, its collected acceleration data and GPS location data are sent to a server via the BLE network. These functions are executed by an application running on the smartphones. Hence, in the proposed system, it is possible to use the smartphone as the sensor terminal as long as one that has sufficient performance for use as the sensor terminal is prepared. To show the effectiveness of the system, we performed multi-hop communication experiments using Downhill in mountains that are at risk of landslides. Results show that Downhill is able to use effectively in the warning area of slope failure.

These tags are used to track objects, navigate people, and deliver contextual advertisements. However, in spite of the wide interest in tracking BLE tags, the primary methods of tracking them are based on signal strength (RSSI) measurements. Past work has shown that such methods are inaccurate, and prone to multipath and dynamic environments. As a result, localization using Wi-Fi has moved to Channel State Information (CSI, includes both signal strength and signal phase) based localization methods. In this paper, we seek to investigate what are the challenges that prevent BLE from adopting CSI based localization methods. We identify fundamental differences at the PHY layer between BLE and Wi-Fi, that make it challenging to extend CSI based localization to BLE. We present our system, BLoc, that incorporates novel, BLE-compatible algorithms to overcome these challenges and enable an accurate, multipath-resistant localization system. Our empirical evaluation shows that BLoc can achieve a localization accuracy of 86 cm with BLE tags, a 3X improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline.

This paper studies the critical problem of localizing the vehicle for user based on BLE received signal strength (RSS) provided by pre-installed BLE Access Points (APs) inside vehicle. Multiple APs are employed to reduce the error caused by RSS fluctuation on distance estimation. Fusion algorithms including Extended Kalman Filter, Monte Carlo Localization and Iterative Trilateration are compared based on experiments in vehicle. Experimental results show that distance estimation based on Extended Kalman Filter gets high accuracy in both long distance and short distance scenario.

This research established the effect of Perspex on Bluetooth transmission in an indoor environment. This research extends on our previous research which evaluated RTLS technologies, RTLS constraints, and an energy efficient design model for sensor detection in indoor environments. Perspex was chosen for this research as it is used as a common shield used to minimize COVID transmission in an office environment. In general, the 3 mm and 5 mm Perspex did not have a significant impact on Bluetooth transmission.

In cases or reports relating to the coronavirus, there are many terms or diction used by the Indonesian government, one of which is ODP (Insider Monitoring). Unsupervised ODP is one of the reasons for the increasing number of positive cases of COVID-19. Based on existing references, there are no studies that develop applications to monitor ODP. So that we will build a mobile-based ODP TRACKING prototype that aims to prevent the COVID-19 that can be caused by ODP by using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology. The ODP Tracker application requires users such as the community, COVID-19 Village Handling Task Force, puskesmas, sub-district & district handling units, and the system administrator. Each of these users has a different role in the application but is related to one another.

The ability for a single node to participate in more than a piconet and to assume both the role of master and slave makes it possible the formation of multi-hop networks that can be used in several emerging application scenarios. Additionally, the inherent low power consumption at the cost of contained throughput makes this technology appealing for Internet of Things (IoT), where power memory and capacity constrained devices exchange messages at relatively low data rates. In this paper, we devise a two layers BLE mesh-based networking paradigm obtained by generalizing Android BE-MESH for hardware-independent sensor networks. Each node enforces a plug-and-play architecture which makes it able to autonomously switch between client and server role, discover and connect to existing scatternets and relay messages through them, making the network able to extend and self re-organize in a distributed fashion. To have our implementation ready for IoT systems we based it on the ESP32 off-the-shelf board. We describe both the implemented functions as well as some practical results proving the effectiveness of the framework in some tested configurations.

Context is here defined in terms of the set of surrounding devices (Bluetooth Low Energy enabled smartphones, WiFi hotspots) and the current calendar event. Contextify is a context-aware Android application which detects the current context and organizes the notes taken within context, allowing a form of context-based retrieval. Thus, the detected context represents location, other people present (referring to their BLE equipped smartphones as user proxies), and events. Users can easily retrieve notes when they return to the context where they created them. A context similarity algorithm derived from the Jaro-Winkler string similarity algorithm is used to compare contexts. Each note is tagged by the user and the system suggests the most appropriate tag, among the already used ones, at annotation creation time: the suggestion is based on the similarity of the current context with the contexts associated with previously tagged notes.

Therefore, a wearable exercise intensity monitoring device can assist user to manage their exercise intensity. Heart rate (HR) is an index to indicate the exercise intensity. In this paper, we proposed a high accuracy HR detection method and implemented it on a wearable and low power device for exercise intensity monitoring. This device consists of a two-electrode ECG amplifier, a MSP430 microprocessor and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module. Moreover, the device can transmit the HR to a Smartphone via the BLE. The accuracy of HR detection method is verified in both resting and dynamic conditions. For resting condition, we use a commercial ECG simulator as signal input and the accuracy of HR detection is 100 percents. For dynamic condition, we use treadmill test. Three subjects (2 male, 1 female) walking in six speeds from 1.8 km/h until 6.3 km/h and running in 7.2 km/h. The accuracy of HR detection is 99.7 percents.

On one end, the ability to detect and locate moving objects is a plus. On the other end, the amount of energy needed to power the tags poses some limitations to its operation. Moreover, as energy harvesting solutions are not always suited, the tags are usually powered by batteries, thus needing recharge or replacement. Therefore, monitoring and estimation of the energy consumption of the tags are required to operate correctly. This contribution presents an experimental setup and methodology to collect data on energy consumption of the tag, using Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth 5.0) for different operation modes, namely the transmission power and the data rate. This methodology allows the estimation of energy needs according to the requirements and adopts energy-saving strategies. The experimental setup uses the Silicon Labs EFR32BG13 family and performs energy measurements via the Simplicity Studio 5 Energy Profiler and the X-NUCLEO-LPM01A board for comparison purposes. The results obtained are presented and discussed.

This is expected to reduce the risk of infection that can be caused by penetrating the tissue in the human body. Hemoglobin measurement still generally use the invasive method, ie by taking and testing blood samples from patients. Therefore, it is proposed solving this problem using PPG signals recorded from the patient's finger using non-invasive method. The signal acquisition is done reflectively by irradiating the finger using 4 LEDs with different wavelengths and then the photodiode will capture the light that is not absorbed by the network. The hemoglobin level can be determined by calculating AC and DC components at each wavelength using linear regression method. The device will connect with smartphone using Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 and will store the hemoglobin value that was measured. In addition, the application will show if the user is in normal condition or anemia as well as tips for people with anemia. The test results of this noninvasive device indicate 1.56 gr/dL RMS with maximum error 3.7 gr/dL and a standard deviation of 0.245 gr/dL. The results were obtained by comparing to invasive tools.

This can enable robust and efficient workspaces to be developed which can be used to improve the lives of those who use them. Global Positioning System (GPS) has a simple implementation and accuracy up to five meters when it is used for outdoor system. However, being able to accurately and efficiently locate devices indoors has been a major challenge in smart buildings. Since GPS cannot be used indoors, there is a need for other wireless technologies which are capable of accurately tracking a target. In this paper, we compare three commonly used wireless technologies for indoor localization: Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), andWiFi. The technologies are compared in terms of localization accuracy and power consumption. According to the experimental results, WiFi is the most optimal technology for use in an indoor localization system, followed by BLE. WiFi was found to be the most accurate and precise technology with an averaging error of 0.5183 m and variance of 0.0979 m. However, in terms of power consumption WiFi was the worst using 216.71 mW while BLE was the best only using 0.367 mW.

These positioning systems use several techniques and technologies to estimate the position of each object, and face several requirements such as position accuracy, security, range of coverage, energy consumption and cost. This paper describes a practical implementation of a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) based localization system that combines multilateration and Kalman filter techniques to achieve a low cost solution, maintaining a good position accuracy. The proposed approach was experimentally tested in an indoor environment, with the achieved results showing a clear low cost system presenting an increase of the estimated position accuracy by 10% for an average error of 2.33 meters.

Key features for this growth are its high data rate and its ultra low energy consumption, making it the perfect candidate for piconets. However, the lack of expandability without serious impact on its energy consumption profile, prevents its adoption on more complex systems which depend on long network lifetime. Thus, a lot of academic research has been focused on the solution of BLE expandability problem and BLE mesh has been introduced on the latest Bluetooth version. In our point of view, most of the related work cannot be efficiently implemented in networks which are mostly comprised of constrained-resource nodes. Thus, we propose a new energy efficient tree algorithm for BLE static constrained-resources networks, which achieves a longer network lifetime by both reducing as much as possible the number of needed connection events and balancing the energy dissipation in the network.

To address these issues, this paper presents an interactive framework, Notify-and-Interact, which leverages the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon infrastructure to notify and a smart-phone to interact, such that it transforms a passive interactive system into an active one. The proposed framework is demonstrated in the Ping Yuan and Kinmay W Tang Gallery, where a series of wildlife artworks are exhibited. Engagement conversion rate is measured, and users' quality of experience (QoE) is surveyed through likert assessment. Artworks with Notify-and-Interact outperforms the QR code with a high engagement conversion rate at the interaction stage, i.e., 86% over 53%, and an average engagement time of 55.67s over 28.69s, respectively. The mean opinion score (MOS) shows that around 80% of the users expressed high satisfaction with the installed Notify-and-Interact framework in the gallery.

This paper presents a statistical model that captures the processing time spent throughout a production line using RSSI data acquired from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network. First, a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is formulated based on the characteristics of production processes. Then, a learning problem is discussed for the re-estimation of state duration probability distribution using the forward-backward algorithm. The Kullback-Leibler Divergence is used to verify the accuracy by comparing between the original and estimated state duration probability distribution with a score of 0.0573. Finally, physical experiment was performed to evaluate the proposed method.

Research has shown that simplifying the forms and enriching them with contextual information can improve the quality and quantity of user feedback. We propose a context-aware survey approach by monitoring the user context with Bluetooth Low Energy devices.

Among them, the Bluetooth Low Energy( BLE) which has been widely adopted in the most of smartphone plays a major communication channel for the range of industrial applications as well as the personal applications. However, since BLE supports only the star topology, it is impossible to configure more complex network topologies, and, in turn, the coverage of the network is limited. In this paper, we propose a method to implement the tree topology network using the BLE. By switching the mode of the BLE module in each network node, it can communicate between nodes at the different layers of the tree topology. Using this approach, the coverage of BLE can be extended widely to other wireless sensor network. The approach proposed in this paper can enable BLE as well as the wireless sensor network( WSN) be used for IoT applications.

The limitation of current contact tracing systems in that a reception of a single beacon is sufficient to reveal the user identity, potentially exposing users to malicious trackers installed along the roads, passageways, and other infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a method based on Shamir secret sharing algorithm, which lets mobile nodes reveal their identity only after a certain predefined contact duration, remaining invisible to trackers with short or fleeting encounters. Through data-driven evaluation, using a dataset containing 18 million BLE sightings, we show that the method drastically reduces the privacy exposure of users. Finally, we implemented the approach on Android phones to demonstrate its feasibility and measure performance for various network densities.

Introduction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) solved the issue well for outdoor scenarios, however, it is not a reliable solution for indoors, where satellite communication (line-of-sight in general) cannot be maintained. Additionally, there are usually many obstructions (i.e. walls), which block or distort the signals or many signal sources causing interference and noise. Thus, indoor positioning requires different and smarter approaches. iBeacon, is new device-to-device communication technology that relies on Bluetooth Low Energy. In this work, we tested accuracy of a known method used to estimate the distance between two devices communicating through the iBeacon technology. Moreover; effects of the output power, placement of the devices, existence of walls and the possible radio interference, on the accuracy of that distance estimation are investigated.

We expect indoor localization to play an important role in indoor public spaces in the future. We model the probability of reception of a packet as a generalized quadratic function of distance, beacon power and advertising frequency. Then, we use a Bayesian formulation to determine the coefficients of the packet loss model using empirical observations from our testbed. We develop a new sequential Monte-Carlo algorithm that uses our packet count model. The algorithm is general enough to accommodate different spatial configurations.

However, BLE devices could contain a number of vulnerabilities at the BLE link layer during broadcasting, pairing, and message transmission. To detect these vulnerabilities directly from the bare-metal firmware, we present FIRMXRAY, the first static binary analysis tool with a set of enabling techniques including a novel base address identification algorithm for robust firmware disassembling, precise data structure recognition, and configuration value resolution. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on the BLE firmware from two leading SoC vendors (i.e., Nordic and Texas Instruments), and implement a prototype of FIRMXRAY atop Ghidra. We have evaluated FIRMXRAY with 793 unique firmware (corresponding to 538 unique devices) collected using a mobile app based approach, and our experiment results show that 98.1% of the devices have configured random static MAC addresses, 71.5% Just Works pairing, and 98.5% insecure key exchanges. With these vulnerabilities, we demonstrate identity tracking, spoofing, and eavesdropping attacks on real-world BLE devices.

The TI Sensor Tag is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) device which consumes very low power during its operation and it uses single coin battery for months of life. It uses the Bluez Library for reading the data from different sensors of Sensor Tag. Now-a-days the traffic on the road has been increasing drastically due to increase in number of vehicle users. On the other hand the simple time based traffic control system is not sufficient for controlling the uneven traffic on the roads during peak hours, which calls for a new Traffic control system. The gesture technology has become very popular for HMI (Human Machine Interface), which provides a virtual environment for controlling devices by giving Gestures. Here we used the Ti Sensor Tag for Hand Gesture Recognition.	[Yasmeen, Gandluri; Arun, S.; Swaminathan, J. N.; Jilani, S. A.

In this work we evaluate experimentally the performance of a proximity-based indoor positioning system built with off-the-shelf beacons in a realistic environment. We demonstrate that the performance of the system depends on a number of factors, such as the distance between the beacon and the mobile device, the positioning of the beacon as well as the presence and positioning of obstacles such as human bodies. We further propose an online algorithm based on moving average forecasting and evaluate the algorithm in the presence of human mobility. We conclude that algorithms for proximity-based indoor positioning must be evaluated in realistic scenarios, for instance considering people and traffic on the used radio bands. The uncertainty in positioning is high in our experiments and hence the success of commercial context-aware solutions based on BLE beacons is highly dependent on the accuracy required by each application.

Inertial sensors widespread the so called embedded systems also prompted for the development of algorithms to cope with their inherent inaccuracy. These sensors, with small form factor and low cost, present an advantage for computing three-dimensional space object orientation. Also radio frequency communication devices are frequently associated with inertial sensor and embedded systems. Radio frequency communication protocols allow immediate data transfer and processing without cumbersome cabling. This work presents a survey of a number of relevant sensor fusion algorithms. The identified algorithms are implemented and its performance tested. Also a Yaskawa Motoman robotic arm is used to implement a set of predefined movements that granted the mandatory test accuracy and repeatability conditions. A Bluetooth Low Energy device has been implemented to transfer the inertial sensor data to a PC computer running a Windows operating system.

Through an ECG, characteristics such as patients' heartbeats, heart conditions, and heart disease can be analyzed. Unfortunately, most available healthcare devices do not provide clinical data such as information regarding patients' heart activities. Many researchers have tried to solve this problem by inventing wearable heart monitoring systems with a chest strap or wristband, but their performances were not feasible for practical applications. Thus, the aim of this study is to build a new system to monitor heart activity through ECG signals. The proposed system consists of capacitive-coupled electrodes embedded in an armband. It is considered to be a reliable, robust, and low-power-transmission ECG monitoring system. The reliability of this system was achieved by the careful placement of sensors in the armband. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) was used as the protocol for data transmission; this protocol was proposed to develop the low-power-transmission system. For robustness, the proposed system is equippedwith analysis capabilities-e.g., real-time heartbeat detection and a filter algorithm to ignore distractions from body movements or noise from the environment.

However, the Global Positioning System, currently the most widely used positioning technology, cannot provide accurate positioning services when obstructed by obstacles. Consequently, this system can only provide outdoor application services such as outdoor navigation and tracking. In 2013, Apple Inc. released iBeacon, a positioning technology based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE). This device transmits Bluetooth signals within a specific range, in which the signals are received by other smartphones to calculate distances for providing indoor positioning-related services. In this study, the iBeacon transmission power level is adjusted to significantly increase Bluetooth signal differences in indoor environments. Therefore, it can reduce received signal strength indicators (RSSI) similarity for some reference points by adjusting the power level. Subsequently, radio frequency signals are filtered using a modified moving average filter to reduce signal variations after reception. Next, pattern matching and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) algorithm are integrated to facilitate positioning. The integration of the modified moving average filter with the KNNs algorithm increases the positioning accuracy by 23.08% during the online phase. This finding can thus improve location-based services.

The roll-call and pen-and-paper method cannot monitor student presence for the whole duration of the class session. Attendance checking systems using mobile technology and the Internet of Things attempt to mitigate these problems, but it also introduces new ones such as inclusivity, cost, and complex implementations. This study investigates the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, a mobile application, and a web server to create an attendance checking mechanism capable of eliminating queues and attendance cheating, monitoring student presence, and automating records. We created two procedures for sending information to our server, to determine the general advantages and disadvantages of each in terms of features, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Procedure 1 mainly uses our Android application which was able to automate and record attendance checking in the background. Procedure 2 uses the ESP32 which was capable of scanning for information from these Android smartphones. Both of these Procedures send information to the web server to create reports based on available records. Overall, Procedure 1 served as the more scalable implementation due to its added features such as alarm systems, and ease of monitoring. However, Procedure 2 was simpler to set-up and more energy-efficient for smartphones since it relied on processing capabilities of the server.

We apply spatial division multiple access (SDMA) to BLE system to deal with massive number of connection requests of BLE devices expected in the future. According to specifications, each BLE peripheral device is assumed to have CFO of up to 150 [kHz] due to hardware impairments. ICA can resolve spatially multiplexed signals even if they include independent CFO. After the ICA separation, the proposed scheme compensates for the CFO. However, the length of the BLE packet preamble is not long enough to obtain accurate CFO estimates. In order to accurately conduct the CFO compensation using the equivalent of a long pilot signal, preamble and a part of estimated data in the previous process are utilized. In addition, we reveal the fact that the independent CFO of each peripheral improves the capability of ICA blind separation. The results confirm that the proposed scheme can effectively compensate for CFO in the range of up to 150 [kHz], which is defined as the acceptable value in the BLE specification.

This paper aims at overcoming the limitations of black-box fuzzing. We present a stateful black-box fuzzing technique that uses a behavioral model of the system under test. Instead of manually creating the model, we apply active automata learning to automatically infer the model. Our framework generates a test suite for fuzzing that includes valid and invalid inputs. The goal is to explore unexpected behavior. For this, we test for conformance between the learned model and the system under test. Additionally, we analyze behavioral differences using the learned state information. In a case study, we evaluate implementations of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol on physical devices. The results reveal security and dependability issues in the tested devices leading to crashes of four out of six devices.

Bluetooth for Internet of Things: A fuzzy approach to improve power management in smart homes	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Power consumption; Fuzzy logic controller; Bluetooth Low Energy; Internet of Things	ENERGY	Thanks to the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), the research and the implementation of home automation are getting more popular because the IoT holds promise for making homes smarter through wireless technologies. There is a main requirement that make a wireless protocol ideal for use in the IoT, that is the energy efficiency. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has a high potential in becoming an important technology for the IoT in low power, low cost, small devices. However, specific techniques can be used in such a way as to further reduce the energy consumption of BLE. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic based mechanism that determine the sleeping time of field devices in a home automation environment based on BLE. The proposed FLC determines the sleeping time of field devices according to the battery level and to the ratio of Throughput to Workload (Th/Wl). Simulation results reveal that using the proposed approach the device lifetime is increased by 30% with respect to the use of fixed sleeping time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One approach is their usage as sensory systems; by exploiting their embedded sensors, it is possible to get data about users. Typically, such sensors are high end, and it is relatively easy to use them by means of Applications. Data access is handled by Android, which decreases sensor performance, as sampling rate, but greatly eases fruition of such information. On the other hand, many useful sensors are available, today, only externally from the smartphone; typically, they can be connected by Bluetooth Low Energy, a widespread standard for Internet of Things. However, this task is cumbersome for a lot of reasons, e.g. the fact that external sensors can be manufactured by different producers with their own proprietary software approach and solutions. The SAndroidE framework allows an easy connection to external sensors/development kits, managing them and their data as if they were embedded in the smartdevice. This work proposes an experimental characterization of measurements by external sensors, highlighting possibilities and limits of the proposed solution, even in complex scenarios.

Users can invite friends through other users and become friends after consent of each other to share their living information. Here, crowdsensing is adopted by using Bluetooth Low Energy attached on mobile phones to collect proximity sensing information. The online social network data from users is extracted, such as expanding co-friend relationship, establishing a relationship chain through the interaction between friends. In this paper, a strategy is proposed to explore the co-friend's affinity incurring the relationship with common preferences for potential users. The friend recommended weighting strategy is derived to make a recommendation of friends among virtual and real communities. Moreover, the system is designed and implemented to realize in the actual environment and to analyze the data to prove the strategy which helps to find potential friends among users.

The lack of continuous on-trip assistance for public transport users discourages many travellers. Thus, the main objective of this work is to design a personal digital travel companion for outdoor location and event detection based on Bluetooth Low Energy, which can be used for intelligent transport technology. After analysing the functional requirements, the proposal is implemented as a mobile application for beacon-based event detection. The system includes an algorithm aided by fuzzy logic to determine the action to be carried out by the user at all times, being able to distinguish between different possible events when more than one beacon is detected. To defend the scheme against possible attacks based on beacon forgery or user tracking, the proposal includes different forms of authentication for data sent from beacons and data sent from the mobile application. The results obtained in simulations show that the proposed system is a viable guidance solution for public transport, including energy saving as one of its main advantages.

However, in a complex BLE network, it can be challenging to select the optimal reference beacon, and accurate positioning becomes difficult. Fortunately, if the BLE network is displayed on a map, we can intuitively grasp the structure and density of the beacons in each area, which is important information for accurate positioning. Therefore, in this study we developed a map-aided indoor positioning algorithm to model the relationship between beacons in the positioning area in a parking lot. Specifically, the algorithm split all beacons into multiple cell areas to find the optimal reference beacon in that area. Then, the optimal reference beacon is used to find the preferred reference beacons among the real-time beacons. Finally, the positioning results were calculated and evaluated according to the preferred beacons. According to the results, our method can optimize the selection of reference beacons in different areas. The average positioning accuracy was 2.09 m and the results can be scored accurately. The results verify that our algorithm can effectively use map information to guide the selection of reference beacons in complex environments.

The proposed system is designed particularly for patients with breathing problems (e. g. respiratory complications after surgery) or sleep disorders. We introduce the use of accelerometer sensor to detect changes in the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest; whereas these changes provide an accurate measurement of respiration rate as well as tidal volume variability. The complete system was comprised of wearable calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. The experiments are conducted with 8 subjects and the overall error in respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.2% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. We also present a method for Tidal Volume variability (TVvar) estimation while validated using Pearson correlation. The mean value of the correlation coefficient between TVvar derived from the accelerometer and spirometer for all subjects and three breath patterns is 0.87 which shows a high correspondence of two signals. Furthermore, the results indicate that the accelerometer driven TVvar achieves the average MSE 1.6E-03 +/- 3.69E-03 compared to the reference.

The system has three major features, such as indoor location, indoor navigation, and physician-patient communication. The experimental results revealed that the proposed localization algorithm achieved 1.48-meter average error.

We conducted a preliminary experiment with a test application to examine whether BLE-based ID logs can be used to analyze daily social behaviors, such as how a child spent the day with his or her friends. The results suggest that the history of behavior with a child's friends was acquired accurately.

Several researchers have tried to find methods to reduce the number of reference points - which need to be manually collected - while maintaining the positioning results, but have focused on other technologies, such as XBee or WLAN, and more specifically Wi-Fi. In this work, a comparison between different fingerprint generation techniques is made in a Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Indoor Positioning System using Received Signal Strength Indicator measurements. Various databases are collected using three Android phones. These data are employed to train different methods that will generate fingerprints to reconstruct the missing points in the databases. The methods used are Inverse Distance Weighting, Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression and Generative Adversarial Networks. After this comparison, it has been found out that all these techniques could reconstruct part of the missing points and improve the positioning results. However, Generative Adversarial Networks achieved the best reconstruction throughout all of the databases.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons installed in a building can benefit the performance of occupancy detection systems, by providing information on an occupant's location. However, BLE beacons operate by broadcasting advertisement messages, and this renders them vulnerable to network attacks. Here, we evaluate the effect of two types of malicious spoofing attacks on a BLE based occupancy detection system, and propose an attack detection method. The building blocks of the system include BLE beacons installed inside the building, a mobile application installed on occupants' phones, and a remote control server where we perform occupancy detection using machine learning. Our real -world experimental results indicate that the attacks can significantly affect the system's performance. Also, our proposed detection method is able to accurately detect an attack by an adversary with physical access, with accuracy ranging from 84% to 91%.

The problem though is that even if the only requirement is room-level localization, those systems are most of the times not cost-efficient and not easy to set-up, since they often require time-consuming calibration procedures. This paper presents a low-cost, threshold-based approach and introduces an algorithm that takes into account both the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and the geometry of the rooms the beacons are placed in. Performance evaluation was done via measurements in an office environment composed of three rooms and in a house environment composed of six rooms. The experimental results show an improved accuracy in room detection when using the proposed algorithm, compared to when only considering the RSSI readings. This method was developed to provide context awareness to the international research project named SmartHeat. The projects aims to provide a system that efficiently heats a house, room by room, based on the habitants' habits and preferences.

The field commissioning of WSANs is generally considered to be time consuming and labor intensive. To increase the efficiency of commissioning process, an on-site diagnosis is extremely important. In this paper, a novel real-time and non-intrusive on-site diagnosis (OSD) for WSANs in BASs is proposed. It implements Out-of-Band Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to transmit diagnosis information without interference on the normal traffic of the BA field network, which has been validated through experiments. By proper utilization of our OSD system, installers can obtain a comprehensive knowledge of the network, which make commissioning much more efficient and cost effective.

At the same time, the configuration and adaptation of these systems to their users' preferences are still mostly manual. To achieve a better personalization of these systems comprehensive virtual profiles of their users, including as much information as possible, is needed. One of the most relevant information of a user virtual profile is his location. With the rise of the bluetooth low energy protocol and the appearance of the beacon technology, indoor positioning of smartphone owners can be added to these virtual profiles. However, the lack of a beacon standard and the low level information provided by these devices is hindering its adoption. To solve this, this paper presents a Beacon Management System that abstracts applications developers from the low level details of the different beacons protocols and allows the management of unregistered beacons. The proposed system has been integrated into the People as a Service computation model and in the commercial platform nimBees to improve the creation of virtual profiles in IoT applications.

The technique was found to provide valuable information for monitoring the fracture healing process and for improving the rehabilitation. This paper introduces a new electronic osteosynthesis implant, which uses supercapacitors as an energy storage for short term autonomous operation. Moreover, a bluetooth low energy (BLE) transceiver is integrated into the system, which covers larger distances and is less sensitive to misalignment than the commonly used inductive data transmission. This improves the usability of the proposed system for the patients. The system can continuously sample and transmit strain values at a sampling rate of 5 Hz for more than 10 min without being recharged. More than 60 cm of distance in any practically relevant direction can be covered by the BLE data transmission if the implant is placed 5 cm deep in a phantom.

Furthermore, a specially tailored mesh-routing algorithm is required in order to achieve battery longevity and node accessibility. In the paper, we propose an improved BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) mesh-routing algorithm for an IoT Smart Home application. The proposed algorithm is based on a time-slotted medium-access scheme, which enables communication nodes to sleep and/or exchange information. In order to achieve compatibility with any BLE-enabled device, such as mobile phones/tablets, routing and data information is transmitted via Eddystone beacons. Performance analysis of the proposed BLE mesh-routing algorithm is carried out using an OMNeT++ discrete simulation environment and Mixim framework. Validation of the proposed algorithm is completed on the basis of measurements from a real-life test network. The results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the IoT applications where the energy efficiency of the communication nodes is a key priority and propagation delays are not critical.

J	Huang, C; Liu, H; Wang, W; Li, JY				Huang, Cheng; Liu, Hao; Wang, Wei; Li, Jianyu			A Compact and Cost-Effective BLE Beacon With Multiprotocol and Dynamic Content Advertising for IoT Application	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Advertising; Internet of Things; Transceivers; Protocols; Intelligent sensors; Hardware; Cost-effective Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacon; dynamic content advertising; multiprotocols advertising	BLUETOOTH LOW-ENERGY; INTERNET; SYSTEM; DESIGN; THINGS	Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacons have been used in a variety of IoT applications. This article proposes a compact and cost-effective BLE beacon, which only uses a 2.4-GHz Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) transceiver and an ultralow power 8-bit 16-MHz microcontroller unit (MCU). The minimum requirements and the data processing procedure for commonly used GFSK transceivers to generate the BLE-compatible advertising packages are also provided in this article. Benefited from the compact architecture and the simple generation procedure, the BLE-compatible packages can be directly controlled to broadcast at any given radio frequency (RF) channel or time. Based on the flexible characteristics of our proposed beacon, the multiprotocol and dynamic content advertising are developed in this article. With the help of multiprotocol and dynamic content advertising, the proposed beacons can be used to provide more sophisticated services. Since the broadcast channels and time are freely controlled, the proposed BLE beacons are also very suitable for anti-collision applications with custom-defined channels and time intervals. The experimental results show that the proposed beacon can broadcast BLE-compatible protocol data units (PDUs) at a minimum interval of about 1 ms. The measured average current is about 51 uA when the advertising interval is 800 ms. Different protocols and dynamic content PDUs generated by the proposed beacon can be properly received by BLE-enabled devices, proving that they are fully compatible with the BLE specification. The measured bit rate of the proposed beacon in dynamic content advertising is about 198.4 kb/s.

Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons, small radio frequency broadcasters that advertise their unique identification, have been highlighted for their possible usage in the IoT infrastructure, as a sensor network of BLE Beacons is capable of providing contextual and locational information to the users. However, as the size of the wireless sensor network has grown, finite battery capacity has proven to be a major challenge. Due to the limited battery capacity, Beacons require periodic maintenance and battery replacement, which results in increased beacon management cost and complexity. This paper attempts to remedy this problem through the integration of an energy harvesting mechanism with BLE Beacons, and explore the possibilities of using solar power to operate these devices. Experimental results for BLE Beacon power consumption and solar panel power output characteristics are presented, and therefore baseline parameters of the power requirements for sustainable BLE Beacons are established. Furthermore, a preliminary design of a solarpowered BLE Beacon is presented. It has been shown that a typical BLE Beacon with a transmission power of 0 dbm and advertising interval of 800 ms can be powered by a solar panel with surface area of 300 cm(2), and a lithium ion rechargeable coin cell battery, LIR2450, with a nominal voltage of 3.6 V can be recharged by a solar panel with a surface area of 88 cm(2).

HAPIN Investigators	The use of bluetooth low energy Beacon systems to estimate indirect personal exposure to household air pollution	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Household air pollution; Microenvironment; Fine particulate matters (PM2.5); LPG Intervention; Indirect exposure	SOLID-FUEL USE; PARTICULATE MATTER; BIOMASS FUELS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; CHILDREN; COMBUSTION; PNEUMONIA; COOKING; COHORT; URBAN	Household air pollution (HAP) generated from solid fuel combustion is a major health risk. Direct measurement of exposure to HAP is burdensome and challenging, particularly for children. In a pilot study of the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial in rural Guatemala, we evaluated an indirect exposure assessment method that employs fixed continuous PM2.5 monitors, Bluetooth signal receivers in multiple microenvironments (kitchen, sleeping area and outdoor patio), and a wearable signal emitter to track an individual's time within those microenvironments. Over a four-month period, we measured microenvironmental locations and reconstructed indirect PM2.5 exposures for women and children during two 24-h periods before and two periods after a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel intervention delivered to 20 households cooking with woodstoves. Women wore personal PM2.5 monitors to compare direct with indirect exposure measurements. Indirect exposure measurements had high correlation with direct measurements (n = 62, Spearman rho = 0.83, PM2.5 concentration range: 5-528 mu g/m(3)). Indirect exposure had better agreement with direct exposure measurements (bias: -17 mu g/m(3)) than did kitchen area measurements (bias: -89 mu g/m(3)). Our findings demonstrate that indirect exposure reconstruction is a feasible approach to estimate personal exposure when direct assessment is not possible.

The bPod is an integrated system comprised of a potentiostat analog-front-end (AFE), a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) microcontroller, and a chemical sensor, exemplified here by a Clark-type DO sensor, which enables monitoring of dissolved oxygen content. The Clark-type electrochemical sensor performs chronoamperometric measurement of DO percent saturation, and the BLE microcontroller wirelessly transmits data to a smartphone while submerged in aqueous media. After several electrode design modifications, the bPod showed a linear electrochemical current response corresponding to DO percent saturation levels with a sensitivity of 37.5 nA/DO% and limit of detection of 8.26 DO%, covering concentration ranges relevant for mammalian culture processes within bioreactors. The wireless bPod provides a free-floating capsule architecture for monitoring DO and can be adapted for an array of electrochemical sensors, targeting different process parameters for diverse bioprocess monitoring applications.

Currently, the cares of elders and children existed some problems of management for several years. Therefore, the IoT is expanded to position and monitor walks of elders and children in a local area. However, the proposed positioning or monitoring systems have high costs and power consumption. In addition, most proposed systems are demanded to match up a smartphone, but the smartphones bring other problems for elders and children. Therefore, a wearable device positioning system, in this study, is proposed. This study main aims at addressing the challenges for those proposed systems to develop a low cost and power consumption system by wearable devices and raspberry pi boards through Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transmission.

In this paper, we proposed an indoor localization approach based on received signal strength (RSS) and Bayesian filter. In the following sections, we describe our virtual modeling method of environment and the way we take object's movement sequences as history conditions in Bayesian filter. The experiment results show that our solution provides accurate tracking results (within 80 centimeters for moving object). The contribution of this research is that it provides a general implementation utilizing Bayesian filter which is able to estimate location precisely with off-the-shelf hardware. And Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is employed which reduces power consumption considerably. Meanwhile the accuracy is sufficient for pedestrian tracking in real application scenarios where BLE devices can be easily deployed.

Distance measurement focused on Bluetooth technology based mainly on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), which is used to calculate the distance between a transmitter and a receiver.

It has become fundamental to wearable health monitoring devices. The human vital signs, such as heart rate (HR), Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and respiration rate, can be clearly extracted from the PPG signal. In this paper, we applied reflectance pulse measurement method on an organic optoelectronic device to measure the PPG signal. We fabricated a monolithic device, a red (625nm) organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and an organic photodiode (OPD) sensitive at the aforementioned wavelength. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the OLED and the OPD were 7% and 47%, respectively. In this work, we utilized a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for sending the measured PPG signal to the central side, desktop computer. The data traffic of the BLE module was 2 kbps at the minimum connection interval 7.5 ms. The reflectance method showed very good results of (1.5) percent error of the heart rate compared to the commercially reference we obtained.

The BLE standard is being developed further to support a wide range of applications spanning smart homes, wearables, and myriad appliances as part of IoT (Internet of Things). These new applications bring forth an important challenge: connection maintenance with low energy consumption in dynamic channel environments. In this paper, we investigate effective solutions to this technical challenge. First, we show using experiments that the current design of using fixed connection intervals incurs significant performance degradation under dynamic link conditions. To overcome the problem, we mathematically find an optimal connection interval that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining connectivity for a given link condition. Then, we design a simple yet effective connection interval adaptation mechanism for BLE, named CABLE. We implement the proposed solution on real embedded devices, and using extensive testbed experiments and simulation verify that CABLE leads to significant performance improvement while providing resilient connectivity in dynamic link environments.

Key features included in Bluetooth Specification version 4.1 are the ability for a single node to be part of multiple piconets, and the ability for a node to act dual mode, as both a piconet master and slave. These features allow the possibility of multi-hop routing spanning multiple connected piconets. Although multi-hop routing is theoretically possible with version 4.1, no multi-hop routing algorithm has never been presented which exploits this possibility. In this paper we propose an approach to scatternet formation and multi-hop routing for networks using BLE version 4.1. We define procedures for device discovery, communication between piconets and forming multi-hop scatternet. Our approach has the following properties, 1) it can be used with existing Bluetooth hardware, 2) the protocol is fully distributed, so global connectivity information is not required for formation and routing, and 3) it supports ad-hoc network formation. We have implemented our approach using real Bluetooth SoCs including the Broadcom BCM434x chipset which is used in the iPhone 6. Our experiments demonstrate the routing delay and throughput using networks containing different numbers of nodes in order to demonstrate the impact of network size on performance. As the network size increases, our protocol does not incur a large delay and achieves better resource utilization.

We focus on measuring real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate monitoring using a smartphone case. With the increasing number of cardiac patients worldwide, this design can be used for early detection of heart diseases. Unlike most of the existing methods that use an optical sensor to monitor heart rate, our approach is to measure real-time ECG with dry electrodes placed on smartphone case. The collected ECG signal can be stored and analyzed in real time through a smartphone application for prognosis and diagnosis. The proposed hardware system consists of a single chip microcontroller (RFduino) embedded with Bluetooth low energy, hence miniaturizing the size and prolonging battery life. The system called "smart case" has been tested in a laboratory environment. We also designed a 3-D printed smartphone case to validate the feasibly of the system. The results demonstrated that the proposed system could be comparable to medical grade devices.	[Mahmud, Md. Shaad; Wang, Honggang; Esfar-E-Alam, A.

However, the fingerprint acquisition and broadcast process in a dense BLE network is very challenging owing to: 1) the likelihood of packet collision; and 2) the length-constrained packet. To this end, we exploit a compressive sensing (CS) framework allowing each node to acquire no more than M measurements from a very dense network, in which the number of nodes N is far greater than M. By aggregating the M-dimensional compressed fingerprint vector from s < N nodes, the receiver is able to reconstruct the fingerprints broadcast by all N nodes. This is the very first work that implements CS on a low power device for fingerprint acquisition. Our proposed compressive RF fingerprinting (CRF) has been demonstrated with real and dense BLE networks, consisting of 300 nodes randomly distributed around a confined area. We also conducted extensive simulations to verify the performance of three different reconstruction algorithms. The low reconstruction error at the receiving end indicates the feasibility of our proposed CRF in achieving efficient fingerprint acquisition for dense BLE networks.

An estimation technique using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) tags becomes most attractive and promising among other techniques for estimating location because a majority of smartphones supports BLE. The BLE tags transmit advertisement (ADV) packets periodically, which include a unique ID related to each tag. When a smartphone receives the ADV packet, the smartphone sends a query to the server to retrieve the location-based information for the ID. To provide such a service continuously, operators have to monitor whether BLE tags work well and repair them in the event of a problem. These operations are difficult because they require physical labor that cannot be automated for a large number of BLE tags spread over a wide area. Therefore, we evaluated the operations of BLE tags quantitatively by the metric of operational costs. We established an environment composed of 54 BLE tags in a four-story building and measured the lifetime of the battery, the service availability ratio, and the operational costs. Through the experiments, we obtained various results regarding the battery management of the BLE tags and the effectiveness of redundant deployment.

IoT Metadata Creation System for Mobile Images and its Applications	2017 11TH IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON SERVICE-ORIENTED SYSTEM ENGINEERING (SOSE)			English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)	APR 06-10, 2017	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, San Jose State Univ		metadata; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); digital snapshots; proximity sensing		This paper proposes the capturing of IoT data and their embedding as metadata in digital snapshots, including photos, audios, and videos. Specifically, we focus on IoT devices based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Technology, which is used for not only data communication but also proximity sensing and is ubiquitous in wearables, smartphones, personal tags, indoor-navigation beacons, and home-automation devices. The IoT metadata can cover different levels, from the radio signal strength and the media-access controller (MAC) address to device name, indoor location, temperature, humidity, air quality, and advertising messages. These IoT data can readily augment metadata such as timestamp, GPS location, and camera settings already captured by today's cameras and saved in digital photo files. With such IoT metadata, the user will have much richer ways to understand the subject and environment of the scene being captured by the photo or media, such as the subject's fitness condition, the advertised events, and the tagged personal items at the scene. These metadata will enable new ways of searching, querying, and organizing the photos and the associated objects. Moreover, a novel mechanism we propose is the ability to pair with a remote device whose identity and routing information is captured as IoT metadata, so that an authorized user can then pair with it at a later time remotely. We contend that IoT metadata capturing can bring significant benefits to the users.

This paper talks about our experiences with iBeacon and establishing its effectiveness in indoor positioning. We placed multiple beacons in a room and recorded received signal strength (RSSI) at designated points (fingerprinting) to create a RSSI fingerprint database. This was used to establish location of a user in real time based on the measured RSSI in the user's mobile device. We found beacon signal strength is inconsistent and is dependent on height, position, direction of device and obstacles. RSSI fingerprinting is time consuming and must be redone if beacons are moved or if room is rearranged. Our conclusion was that iBeacon was more suitable for applications around proximity rather than positioning.	[Deepesh, P.

Sensing technologies are promising solutions that can provide cost-effective answers to these challenges. In this paper, we focus on long-term in-house activity monitoring that aims at early detection and prevention of such conditions. In this context, we present and experimentally evaluate an ultra low-power (less than 100-mu W long-term average power consumption) on-body activity sensing prototype system that is based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE). As part of a larger smart home monitoring architecture, the role of the presented system is to collect and reliably deliver acceleration data to the upper layers of the architecture. The system evaluation incorporates a thorough power consumption study that facilitates meaningful battery lifetime estimations, an insightful coverage study in an actual residential environment, and the investigation of energy-efficient packet loss mitigation techniques.

In this paper, we present FineLoc, a fine-grained self-calibrating localization system based on the freely-deployed Bluetooth low energy (BLE) nodes and crowdsourced data, which can profile more detailed layout information of the indoor space. We first reveal that existing systems can only generate inaccurate floor plans owning to the coarse-grained Wi-Fi reference information. Then, we utilize the increasingly popular BLE beacon nodes as the source of reference information, with which a series of dead-reckoning optimization and new schemes particularly for finer-grained indoor map construction are presented. We implement a prototype FineLoc system, which is deployed in around 11,000 m(2) areas. Our experimental results with the prototype show that FineLoc can achieve 80 percent localization errors within 1.6 m, 1.4 m, and 1.1 min the library, classroom building, and office building, respectively, with an average density of deployed BLE nodes less than 2.6/100 m(2).

In the context of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) this generally reflects in a human watching the video recordings of the activities carried out by the target user to assign a label to each video frame. The label can refer, for example, to the nature of the performed activity, or to the time series collected through sensors worn by the user or present in the environment. This paper deals with the automation of the data annotation process in the HAR context by presenting a methodology that (i) maps Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons distributed in the environment to the locations where a human typically performs activities like eating, cooking, working, and resting, and (ii) associates the data collected by sensors embedded in the smartwatch worn by the user (i.e., acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetometer) to the nearest BLE beacon. In this way, data gathered through the smartwatch are automatically annotated with the human activity associated to the nearest beacon.

A beacon application in users smartphone connects an offline physical beacon with an online service produced by a service provider. However, since the BLE beacon separately operates by each service provider, users need to run multiple providers applications to access different providers service. This leads to much energy and resource consumption which potentially hinders other common uses of the smartphone. In this paper, we proposed GS1beacon, a GS1 standard based integrated BLE beacon service platform which could find the desired service regardless of providers applications, and provide multiple services in a single BLE beacon. To realize this, we construct a global discovery system by using an Object Name Service (ONS) and unify format of a BLE beacon ID by using a GS1 ID keys. Additionally, we prototyped GS1beacon service platform and showed its feasibility through case study, and performance evaluation.

This node is used to monitor the body temperature and heart rate of a human through a mobile application. Thus, it includes a temperature sensor, a heart pulse sensor, a low-power microcontroller, and a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) module. The power supply of the node is a lithium-ion rechargeable battery, but this battery has a limited lifetime. Therefore, a photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting system is proposed to prolong the battery lifetime of the sensor node. The PV energy harvesting system consists of a flexible photovoltaic panel, and a charging controller. This PV energy harvesting system is practically tested outdoor under lighting intensity of 1000 W/m(2). Experimentally, the overall power consumption of the node is 4.97 mW and its lifetime about 246 hours in active-sleep mode. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate long-term and sustainable operation for the wearable sensor node.

For this purpose, it is also important to present the collected data using an efficient visualization technique. In order to exploit this opportunity, this paper presents the design considerations for a low-cost, environmental data acquisition, processing and visualization system which is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and can be deployed and scaled in residential and industrial settings. We propose and develop a low power wireless sensor network, which is capable of working with relatively distant sensors.

Many researches to conserve electrical consumption have been presented. Providing residents with information on their energy consumption has become a feasible option to promote energy saving in residential sector. In this Paper, the electrical energy monitoring systems are designed based on a non-intrusive sensors, Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) and Factorial Hidden Markov Model algorithm (FHMM).

BLE beacons can be mounted in shoes for convenience, and a shoe-mounted directional antenna is expected to efficiently radiate the beacon signals to the data server of the monitoring system. In this paper, a directional array antenna with planar or curved structure was designed on the shoe surface for this purpose. The antenna was designed to sweep diagonally upward from 10 degrees to 50 degrees, and the simulated and measured S-11 performances revealed reasonable agreement. The antenna was assumed to be used in an urban environment, and a directional patch array antenna with dielectric lens was also designed to receive beacon signals by mounting it on utility poles. According to a feasibility experiment result of elderly wanderer position identification, the designed directional antenna can provide an almost 100% position identification rate if a wanderer is within 20 m from a smart phone user.

Examples in the literature have proven the reliability of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based communication systems and indicated that it could be employed in sensor data transfer applications. Therefore, our solution to the aforementioned issue is independent joint modules that comprise a motor driver, a microcontroller for running servo control loops, and a BLE device that enables the module to communicate with the main processor of the robot without the need of bulky cabling. Target applications for this method are mobile robots that encapsulate onboard processors and actuators that are deployed within a short range.

However, the design of such systems still poses challenges, including restricted physical size, limited computational resources, and the availability of constrained energy sources. In this paper, we present a practical design space exploration of a body-worn system for prosthetic hand control based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The sEMG method is a well-established sensing technology that provides the detection of electrical activity produced by the physiological contractions of muscles. The presented wearable system is designed to acquire sEMG signals for successive recognition of the performed motion and the control of the prosthetic hand, allowing to regain a considerable amount of life quality for a broad patient community. The main guiding requirements for the presented wearable system include real-time data acquisition from up to 32 sEMG channels, reliable wireless data streaming, long mobile autonomy (several days lifetime), non-intrusive mounting, and compact size. We present the system's hardware and software architecture focusing on the comparison of various communication design options such as recent Bluetooth low energy and low-power WiFi technologies.

Many of these systems use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal strength data to estimate the distance between two persons. The quality of this method depends on many factors and, therefore, does hardly deliver accurate results. We present a multi-channel approach to improve proximity classification, and a novel, publicly available data set that contains matched IEEE 802.11 (2.4 & 5 GHz) and BLE signal strength data, measured in four different environments. We utilize these data to train machine learning models. The evaluation showed significant improvements in the distance classification and consequently also the contact tracing accuracy. However, we also encountered privacy problems and limitations due to the consistency and interval at which such probes are sent. We discuss these limitations and sketch how our approach could be improved to make it suitable for real-world deployment.

Many of these devices rely on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a communication protocol for their control or the transfer of data. Trivial attacks can easily target these devices to compromise them due to their low security features and inherent vulnerabilities in their software and communication components. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack against BLE devices while collecting datasets of network traffic data exchange with and without the attack. Secondly, we study the use of machine learning to detect this attack by combining unsupervised and supervised techniques. We applied and compared two unsupervised techniques to reconstruct the model of BLE communications and detect suspicious data batches. We then applied a classification method based on Text-CNN technique to classify packets as normal or attack inside each suspicious batch. Our model reconstruction results show that we are able to discriminate normal and attack models with high precision and our classification method achieves high accuracy (approximate to 0.99) and low false positive rate (approximate to 0.03).

One of the cases is the diversity of communication protocol used in IoT devices. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a multi-protocol gateway that can receive several protocols at once, i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy and ZigBee from IoT devices. The gateway is powered by a single board computer which is equipped by required transceiver module. A python script is used to control the process in the backend, along with MySQL for data storage and a frontend user interface built by Lazarus. A dashboard that displays the collected data and the network topology is provided to validate the work of the gateway. As the result, the gateway is able to accept all of the three communication protocols at the same time and display the data in real time in the dashboard. The result also shows that each protocol has different delay and packet delivery ratio. The WiFi protocols is found to have the largest delay which is 362 ms, and also the lowest packet delivery ratio which is 97%.

For the development of 131,E applications, testing is important; however, two major problems exist in that physical device preparation is costly and replay testing is difficult. To avoid these problems, we propose a novel approach to BLE application testing that employs emulation using the newly designed BluMoon architecture, which is a BLE emulation system with utilization software. The BluMoon emulation system design follows the communication model of actual BLE. However, BluMoon uses software -implemented pseudo controllers instead of physical controllers. Interaction with remote devices is emulated through exchange of virtual packets, where each virtual packet encapsulates an entire BLE link layer packet format in its payload. Here, we implement a pseudo controller with an advertising function, establishing a connection and exchanging data. We also evaluate the BluMoon implementation performance and measure the resource usage at Moon execution, the received packet loss rate, and the response time of HCI command execution. The results show that BluMoon exhibits performance satisfactory for practical application, for all measured items.

However, existing works use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for cross-technology modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10bps). Our approach, called BlueBee, aims at achieving much higher CTC throughput thus extends CTC applications. We proposes a new direction by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance (i.e., BLE and ZigBee) and transparency by selecting only the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at the BLE senders and ZigBee receivers. Our implementation on commodity device testbeds shows that BlueBee can achieve a more than 99% accuracy and a throughput 10,000x faster than the state-of-the-art CTC reported so far. Here we demonstrate using BlueBee on a smartphone to control several smart light bulbs attached with ZigBee radio.

We could determine the degree of familiarity by using personal information gleaned from a social networking service. For a real-time service, we usually use video data. Unfortunately, this data is closely related to a user's privacy, so the user may feel uncomfortable about its use. Therefore, in this study, we set out to devise a real-time familiarity analysis model using a minimal amount of information and a Bluetooth low-energy beacon. Unlike the traditional approach, the devices receiving the beacon signal are placed on a desk, wall, or ceiling and the user carries a beacon. The beacon transmits only its ID and a received signal strength indication (RSSI) signal. Using the device for receiving the beacon signal, a user's location can be monitored so that the server can analyze the intragroup and calculate the degree of familiarity between users. This study addressed those situations arising in a party-like event, in a school, in a company, etc. to attempt to analyze the degree of familiarity by determining a person's location at specific times. This technology could also be applied to exhibitions, parks, and amusement parks to determine the most popular exhibits, spots, and facilities in real time.

In such a scenario, the company support service may take advantage of a dynamic coupling and interaction among the Cloud, mobiles (as personnel-borne equipment), and IoT devices (as bolt-on addition to the, possibly legacy, CPE). For this purpose, a software architecture for the collection and transmission of metrics of interest through a combined system, featuring a Cloud instance and a mobile-based agent, has been implemented. The reference architecture is composed of IoT-Cloud and edge/mobile devices, specifically smartphones and embedded boards, the latter equipped with a Cloud-controlled agent as a software component, with the goal to collect useful metrics from hardware devices of an energy substation, as a way to support remote and on-site diagnostics through technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy. We present the reference architecture, its implementation, and some preliminary results on the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

However to correlate the diverse data from distributed sensor nodes possess a huge challenge in terms of defining a global time in the network and thereby generates a demand for time synchronization in the network. Before employing time synchronization in such a CPS based network it is required to carefully consider number of parameters including precision, security, reliability, processing time, memory requirement and energy costs. In this paper an energy-efficient clock synchronization method using two-way message exchange protocol which was recently proposed and theoretically proved namely pairwise-broadcast synchronization (PBS) and another similar method called timing-sync protocol for sensor networks (TPSN) were implemented. For this purpose a novel autarkic hardware pair was designed to enable the interoperability with existing infrastructure. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) medium was taken into consideration to ease the medical certification procedure and low power consumption. An experimental evaluation of the methods focusing on their reproducibility, precision, and performance overhead was discussed.

In particular, two different methods are studied to detect the user's position, the first based on proximity and the second based on fingerprinting techniques with self-training. The proposed methodology allows a very easy-to-use deployment by the user and with a very low economic cost. A set of experiments have been carried out to assess the performance of the proposed techniques presented in this paper, where a real user has captured data for several days at home. The results obtained show that the fingerprinting-based method is the most effective to accurately detect the user's position and the transitions performed between the different areas of interest at home.

While current home automation systems provide localization at a GPS level, they do not identify users' locations within a building. The smart home technology market is growing rapidly and this feature can differentiate a product line by adding unique capabilities for the consumer. The objective for this system is to use individualized location determination to improve lifestyle areas in the home in passive and non-intrusive ways. Being passive is important in that users should not have to take extra steps (e.g., pushing a button when they enter a room) as they move throughout their house. Being non-intrusive is important because users should not have to wear anything extra (e.g., a special armband) or have personal information scanned (e.g., facial recognition camera). The system will use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to identify and track users' movements throughout a house, where the BLE signal of an individual will be associated with a smartphone or fitness wearable that they normally carry with them. A unique aspect of this project is the implementation of a flipped BLE architecture, which is implemented with a Texas Instruments development board that acts as a beacon to identify users based on their BLE signals from their smartphones and wearables. This architecture is "flipped" because most BLE beacons rely on a smartphone to "see" the beacons whereas the beacons in this system are "seeing" the smartphones. After identifying BLE devices in proximity to the beacon, the prototype system will record readings on the beacon locally, store data in an SQL database, and clean and process data through a PHP script. Different use cases for the BLE system within a house were considered. The final prototype will focus on a Smart Thermostat application which automatically adjusts where a thermostat reads the indoor temperature based on the location of the users. Results include a fully functioning prototype that can be used to demonstrate feasibility of the home automation use cases. Test results from the prototype include using a factorial experiment to measure the effect of distance and obstacles on the signal strength readings as well as performance on the system through a range of scenarios.

A number of efforts have been exerted to achieve high positioning accuracy. However, there exists no technology that proves its efficacy in various situations. In this paper, we propose a novel positioning method based on fusing trilateration and dead reckoning. We employ Kalman filtering as a position fusion algorithm. Moreover, we adopt an Android device with Bluetooth Low Energy modules as the communication platform to avoid excessive energy consumption and to improve the stability of the received signal strength. To further improve the positioning accuracy, we take the environmental context information into account while generating the position fixes. Extensive experiments in a testbed are conducted to examine the performance of three approaches: trilateration, dead reckoning and the fusion method. Additionally, the influence of the knowledge of the environmental context is also examined. Finally, our proposed fusion method outperforms both trilateration and dead reckoning in terms of accuracy: experimental results show that the Kalman-based fusion, for our settings, achieves a positioning accuracy of less than one meter.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also been concerned about the unknown rate of repeat and prolonged use of ultrasound detectors. Fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) and HR monitoring devices based on bio-potential acquisition have been developed; however, they are bulky and intrusive, thus not widely accepted. Here, we present innovative non-contact electrode ECG sensors on a small unobtrusive patch which could be attached to the abdomen, or inside garment, incorporated with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless communication, to transfer the acquired data to a smartphone. An Android app was developed to extract the mixed maternal/fetal ECG (f/mECG) signals. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple and robust scheme to provide accurate 24/7 monitoring of f/mHR, with the potential to expand to f/mECG monitoring in the home setting.

The focusing technique, combined with the frequency-scanning behavior of LWAs, allows for obtaining well-defined radiation patterns in the vicinity of the antenna, which properly overlap to obtain the scanning monopulse functions. This is not possible with conventional far-field focused antennas, in which the radiation pattern is very distorted in the near-field region. As a proof of concept, examples using the three advertising channels provided by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol are shown. These channels (#37, #38 and #39) arc placed at 2.402, 2.426 and 2.48 CHz, respectively.

Devices in IoT must be low powered in order to extend their lifetime. BLE compatible AltBeacon is aptly suited for this purpose. We have developed an application to show how various disparate technologies are integrated together to form IoT paradigm. We use a fixed AltBeacon node which allows an application running on a smart phone to determine its proximity with respect to the AltBeacon node. Once the application finds that it is within the proximity of the AltBeacon node then we can control various IP enabled devices through RESTful Service. We have proposed a software framework which can be used to automate IoT based on the proximity. This framework can be extended to control any of the IP enabled devices for Home Automation and Industrial Systems. From our experiments we determined that 1.5m is an optimum range for proximity.

The Bluetooth protocol is utilized in many low-cost devices to implement wireless data transmission. We begin by framing Bluetooth as two distinct protocols: Bluetooth Classic (BTC) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We evaluate currently available Bluetooth penetration testing tools including Bluelog, BTscanner, Redfang, Spooftooph, BlueRanger, Bluesnarfer, BlueMaho, Bluepot, Ubertooth, Crackle, BTLEJuice, Gattacker, and Blue Hydra for both BTC and BLE. The survey demonstrates that these tools have a limited range of capabilities and most tools are only compatible with a single protocol, but not both. This discovery motivates the development of BlueFinder, an open-source range-finding tool compatible with both BTC and BLE devices. We evaluate BlueFinder in both line-of-sight (LOS) and beyondline-of-sight (BLOS) environments to develop a distance estimation technique based off the log-distance path loss model. The model generates parameters by minimizing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Data is collected by quantifying the received signal strength (RSS) of incoming packets at varying distances and recording their values for later statistical evaluation. The model distance estimate is a function of three parameters: reference distance, RSS, and the path loss exponent. A calibration test run utilizes experimental and iterative simulation techniques to produce the model parameter values. Initial experiments show that statistically meaningful results are not achieved by using raw RSS alone, so we use mean RSS to achieve a fit with less than 20% MAPE at distances ranging up to 1,000 meters. The model is validated against a BTC electrocardiogram machine and a BLE wearable heart rate monitor in a warwalking scenario. An evaluation between BlueFinder and Blue Hydra finds that our model provides a significant improvement when operating at distance greater than 50 meters.

However, while wireless technology is far advanced it has yet to be accepted by the medical sector, primarily through concerns of cost, reliability and interoperability. Bluetooth low energy meets all of these requirements and has the added advantage that it will be able to communicate with the Bluetooth chips likely to be fitted to the next generation of mobile phones. That means patient data could be transmitted to a medical facility via the cellular network eliminating the need to build expensive specialised communication links. But while Bluetooth low energy specification promises much, there are some technical challenges - such as protection of privacy - to overcome.

This is of particular relevance when these technologies are deployed as part of capillary networks. The physical layer parameters of BLE and IEEE 802.11ah are modeled, together with a detailed and accurate indoor propagation scenario that accounts for wall losses, ray tracing multi-path, and diffractions. A real case office building scenario is considered for practical evaluation. The minimum density of BLE central devices and IEEE 802.11ah access points that guarantees a predetermined coverage level is derived and compared between the two technologies. It is shown that BLE requires five times the number of central devices than IEEE 802.11ah access points to guarantee 95% coverage. IEEE 802.11ah benefits from the use of lower frequency band, higher transmit power and better receiver sensitivity than BLE, which permits a low cost and effective deployment of Internet of Things applications. Mesh capabilities and range extension for BLE are therefore essential for the success of BLE within the Internet of Things framework.

While many alternatives were proposed to improve security, passwords are still included in any authentication procedure today. With the proposal of FIDO and FIDO2/WebAuthn a very promising approach was presented in the last years that may replace passwords at some time since it also enables password-less authentication in addition to work as a second factor for any web authentication. Although FIDO2/WebAuthn solves many problems of passwords using public/private key cryptography and the possibility to use strong authentication mechanisms like biometrics, it is still not capable of detecting an attacker once a successful login has happened. In this paper we evaluate the extension of FIDO2/WebAuthn to enable continuous authentication in the web. While this extension would enable the many proposals of continuous authentication for system or device protection to be used for web authentication, it allows the exchange of the relying parties' security requirements on the one hand and the authenticator's capabilities on the other hand, too. We evaluate our extension using an Android-based roaming authenticator communicating via Bluetooth Low Energy and show that the FIDO2/WebAuthn extension mechanism is suitable. While a real world deployment would require modifications in the different browser implementations, we further point out the challenges resulting from the different implementation levels and the high dynamics in the standard development such as different notification windows or parallelism issues.

However, the learning procedure of radio signals in fingerprinting is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, an affinity propagation clustering (APC)-based fingerprinting localization system with Gaussian process regression (GPR) is presented for a practical positioning system with the reduced offline workload and low online computation cost. The proposed system collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) data from the deployed Bluetooth low energy beacons and trains them with the Gaussian process model. As the signal estimation component, GPR predicts not only the mean RSS but also the variance, which indicates the uncertainty of the estimation. The predicted RSS and variance can be employed for probabilistic-based fingerprinting localization. As the clustering component, the APC minimizes the searching space of reference points on the testbed. Consequently, it also helps to reduce the localization estimation error and the computational cost of the positioning system. The proposed method is evaluated through real field deployments. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the offline workload and increase localization accuracy with less computational cost. This method outperforms the existing methods owing to RSS prediction using GPR and RSS clustering using APC.

The study on the architecture and networking is quite necessary for the development of BLE Mesh. In IoT, the BLE devices are often used for voice, audio and data services. To satisfy the demands of diverse services and the mobility of the nodes, a hierarchical BLE mesh network (HBMN) architecture is proposed consisting of Hub Layer, Mesh Layer and User Layer. The HBMN architecture combines the star-network and mesh topology. Besides, the networking process of HBMN from the unprovisioned devices is also investigated in this paper. Moreover, two important performance measures have been analyzed and derived including networking time and single-hop delay. Finally, the access delay of one node is measured on the nRF52832 hardware platform. In addition, the networking time and single-hop delay of HBMN are evaluated and compared with the traditional BLE scatternet. The results show that the average single-hop delay of the BLE scatternet is 1.74 times as long as HBMN averagely and HBMN has a superior performance on the networking time when the network has a large number of devices.

Because IoT devices are primarily battery-driven, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networking is appealing to conserve battery life. The importance of battery life in a mobile ad hoc network increases the sensitivity of the network to cyberattacks intended to impact battery life. A Battery Exhaustion Attack can overwhelmingly exhaust the batteries of network nodes by making malicious service requests. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection and prevention approach for this type of attack. This approach requires the suspicious nodes to switch connection to the neighbors of its connected nodes periodically. When a suspicious node is identified as malicious, it is blacklisted to prevent future attacks. Even when a malicious node cannot be detected, its impact is distributed across the network in order to extend the overall network lifetime.

To come up with valuable services, several solutions to analyze the spatio-temporal trajectories of visitors have been put forward. However, they neither consider the inherent uncertainty of the underlying indoor positioning technologies - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), RFID, etc. - nor other visitors' features apart from the spatio-temporal ones (e.g. the level of interaction with the museum displays). For that reason, the present work introduces RECITE, a framework to classify trajectories representing visitors' actions that copes with the aforementioned limitations of existing solutions. Firstly, RECITE states a novel mapping process for a BLE-based indoor positioning system to accurately detect the visitors' locations. On top of this mechanism, RECITE includes an ensemble of fuzzy rule classifiers able to tag the visitors' ongoing trajectories in real time considering both spatio-temporal and other behavioural factors. Finally, the framework has been evaluated in a case of use scenario showing quite promising results.

The blePRC supported set-top boxes would implement common components and associated interfaces, such that IoT device vendors could develop application services for IoT devices, and users could deploy these services on their set-top boxes and control related IoT devices with their smartphones via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, thereby eliminating the need to install several vendor-specific gateways at home. As BLE technology is designed for device-to-device communication, the bleRPC framework provides a means for a service in a bleRPC supported set-top box to distinguish between remote applications in the same user smartphone. Consequently, this study also contributes to providing application-level authentication and access control mechanisms for BLE-based service.

However, the state-of-the-art CTC designs have intrinsic limitations in the throughput due to their use of coarse-grained packet-level information. In contrast, we propose to exploit the fine-grained signal modulation information via a technique called PHY-layer emulation to boost CTC throughput. We can embed a legitimate packet of a target technology, e. g., ZigBee, within the payload of a source technology, e. g., WiFi or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). At the mean time, we require no modification at the hardware or firmware at either sender or receiver. We can achieve 8,000x throughput from WiFi to ZigBee and 10,000x throughput from BLE to ZigBee compared to the state of the art. We also have a demo showcasing how our designs can be implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones for smart light bulbs control.

The use of wearable health devices has skyrocketed in recent years, allowing continuous assessment of physiological parameters in patients and research cohorts. While most health wearables monitor the heart, lungs and skeletal muscles, devices targeting the brain are currently lacking. To promote brain health in the general population, we developed a novel, low-cost wireless cerebral oximeter called FlexNIRS. The device has 4 LEDs and 3 photodiode detectors arranged in a symmetric geometry, which allows for a self-calibrated multi-distance method to recover cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation (SO2) at a rate of 100 Hz. The device is powered by a rechargeable battery and uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless communication. We developed an Android application for portable data collection and real-time analysis and display. Characterization tests in phantoms and human participants show very low noise (noise-equivalent power <70 fW/root Hz) and robustness of SO2 quantification in vivo. The estimated cost is on the order of $50/unit for 1000 units, and our goal is to share the device with the research community following an open-source model. The low cost, ease-of-use, smart-phone readiness, accurate SO2 quantification, real time data quality feedback, and long battery life make prolonged monitoring feasible in low resource settings, including typically medically underserved communities, and enable new community and telehealth applications.

An outstanding example is the BLE beacon-based electronic attendance system (BEAS) used in many universities today to increase the efficiency of lectures. Despite its popularity and usefulness, however, BEAS has not been thoroughly analyzed for its potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we neutralize a university's BEAS by maliciously cheating attendance (i.e., faking attendance while the subject is not physically present at the location) in various scenarios using signal imitation attack, and investigate its possible vulnerabilities. The BEAS exploited in this paper is a commercial system actually used in a well-known university. After the exploitation experiment, we analyze the system's weaknesses and present possible counter-measures. Furthermore, additional attack methods are shown to re-counteract those possible counter-measures and to discuss the fundamental challenges, deficiencies, and suggestions in electronic attendance systems using BLE beacons.

This technology is widely employed to collect patients' vital signs, to provide wireless connectivity to medical equipment, and to enable communications between devices carried by hospital personnel, patients and visitors. This paper presents a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of the interferences, from different wireless technologies, on the performance of a BLE-based body area networks operating over the 1 Mbit/s physical layer (PHY). The interfering technologies addressed are ZigBee (802.15.4), Wi-Fi (802.11), and the newly introduced BLE version 5.0 (coded PHY). The results for the latter are supported by real-life measurements, which are reported in this paper, thus giving some insight into the practical performance of this new technology. The presented numerical results provide guidance on how to manage these various technologies to minimize the packet error rate (PER) of the communications emanating from the on-body BLE enabled devices.

The ULP is reached by using single-stage inverter-based operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA) instead of two or more stages OTA. The effects of the low voltage gain and resistive loading are reduced by using a process and temperature robust negative transconductor connected to the virtual ground. The ultra-low voltage operation is reached by using only two stacked transistors and PMOS bulk forward bias. The CxBPF operates well down to 0.4V power supply and the experimental results present power dissipation of only 10.9 mu W/pole, 1 MHz bandwidth centered at 2 MHz, image rejection rate of 34 dB, and 12.7 fJ FoM.

A Power-Efficient BLE augmented GNSS Approach to Site-Specific Navigation	2020 IEEE/ION POSITION, LOCATION AND NAVIGATION SYMPOSIUM (PLANS)	IEEE-ION Position Location and Navigation Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/ION Position, Location and Navigation Symposium (PLANS)	APR 20-23, 2020	Portland, OR	IEEE, ION		Bluetooth Low Energy; indoor positioning; active RFID; LoRa	TRACKING; WIFI	The demand for site-specific localization is increasing. For example, locating patients in hospitals, monitoring worker safety, and guiding visitors in museums are all desired. Active RFID is one of the most common approaches to delevoping site-specific navigation systems. In comparison to passive RFID technologies, active RFID devices can provide wider coverage, basic bidirectional communication functionalities, and it generally requires fewer access points and lower installation costs. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are widely used to perform outdoor positioning. An advantage of GNSS is that ground infrastructure is not required, only a GNSS receiver, but its performance is degraded by the presence of line-of-sight blocking and multipath. Although BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) based indoor positioning has been broadly studied, using BLE augmented GNSS for real-time pedestrian positioning is uncommon and ambitious. Low power consumption is the key to creating wearable localization devices. The power consumption of GNSS devices increases when the GNSS reception is poor. For active RFID tags, a BLE based localization system can be used to augment the GNSS when the GNSS reception is degraded, even taking over the positioning task to put GNSS into rest. The wearable device is required to wirelessly send its position to a central control system. There are numerous possibilities for this backhaul communication system, however only low data rate is required, and the solution should be low power. LoRa is a recently developed modulation scheme that provides long-range and low power consumption, albeit at a low datarate. This paper proposes a power-efficient scheme for site-specific navigation in which the best estimate of position is determined through data fusion of GNSS and BLE. An algorithm also provides a seamless transition between measurement sources and a low-power accelerometer enabled adaptive smoothing filter of the trajectory. The careful use of low-power modes for GNSS, inertial sensing and the microcontroller, combined with a LoRa backhaul, provided a power-efficient navigation solution. Measurements within an office environment demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed site-specific navigation system.

As a demonstration study, we need a continuous and instant localization and trajectory collection system. We have developed a localization system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and smartphones in our college campus. The system has been established to realize automated student roll call with 1,600 BLE beacon emitters installed on our campus. We can estimate the location of a smartphone in our campus by analyzing received BLE beacons and their RSSIs (Received Signal Strength Indicators). In this paper, we demonstrate how we collect human trajectory data and how we can detect specific human behaviors from the collected data. We have obtained human trajectory data from 169 research participants comprised of 671 trips during the study held as a college festival event. Each research participant walked around with his/her smartphone. The smartphone continuously received BLE beacons during the event and periodically sent them to the server as a trajectory. We apply comparative sequential pattern mining to the obtained trajectory data and extract sequential patterns that are different between male trajectories and female trajectories. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of human trajectory data collection by a BLE beacon system and data analysis by comparative sequential pattern mining.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and IEEE 802.15.4 are two low-power wireless standards that are widely used in sensor network applications. They share the same unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum. To be able to employ both technologies in the same environment in a heterogeneous network, the creation of a proper coexistence mechanism is imperative. In this paper, we propose and develop a cooperative mechanism for the coexistence of co-located IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE networks in the time domain. This mechanism tries to avoid overlap of communications in these networks in order to decrease the chance of Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) and thus packet drops. The proposed mechanism does not impose any protocol change. The performance of the proposed mechanism is evaluated by using real hardware devices. The experimental results show that the overall packet reception ratio improves up to 12%.

J	Ng, PC; She, J; Park, S				Ng, Pai Chet; She, James; Park, Soochang			High Resolution Beacon-Based Proximity Detection for Dense Deployment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Proximity detection; bluetooth low energy beacon; proximity-based services; deployment density	DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; BLUETOOTH; LOCALIZATION; LOCATION; OPTIMIZATION; INTERNET; PEOPLE; ENERGY; SYSTEM	The emergence of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons has promoted the development of proximity-based service (PBS), which is a context-aware application delivered subject to the Proximity of Interest (Pol). Most commercial applications use the sequential proximity detection with a fixed scanning mechanism to identify the target Pol. Such sequential execution, though is able to produce reliable detection, suffers severe performance degradation especially when the number of deployed beacons in the vicinity increases. To understand the effects of dense deployment, we conduct an empirical investigation and derive the statistical properties of both received signal strength (RSS) and signal inter-arrival time. In light of the statistical insights, this paper proposes a high resolution proximity detection using an adaptive scanning mechanism fusion with a spontaneous Differential Evolution (AS+sDE). This novel approach enables the receiver to adapt its scanning duration conditioned on the deployment density and make an almost spontaneous detection in parallel with the scanning. The feasibility of the proposed approach is verified by both simulations and real-world implementations. For a density of <= 5 beacons/m(2), AS+sDE achieves a superior performance with a high accuracy rate, i.e., on average < 1 s is spent to guarantee at least 90 percent accuracy.

However, the need for specialized receiver systems has limited the use of backscatter in wireless sensing applications. To address this need, we introduce the first backscatter-based wireless sensor tag that can stream sensor data to any of the billions of existing Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) devices, including smartphones, tablets, and PCs. The FPGA-based "BLE Backscatter Sensor Node" (BBSN) uses an external carrier source and requires no modifications to smartphone, tablet, or PC hardware or software whatsoever. The device transmits a 1.0 Mbps data stream with BLE-compatible frequency-shift keying modulation. The backscatter modulator consumes only 158 pJ/bit, making it over 60X more energy efficient than a conventional BLE active radio (>10 nJ/bit).

Since LBSs are in the process of being ubiquitous, it is essential to find a low-cost and low energy solution for localization. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for indoor localization is a smart choice for giving economical solutions to the industry with additional advantages like trouble-free connection to other gadgets. We propose an improved RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) based fingerprinting technique in which data is first augmented and then classified using Machine Learning algorithms. This indoor localization technique facilitates us to recognize the XY-position of the user node (UN) or tag, which receives signals from the anchor nodes (ANs). The fluctuations in the RSSI values were large, because they were affected by multipath propagation and other factors in the indoor positioning environment. The fingerprinting data was augmented to overcome these drawbacks, to decrease the computational cost, to guarantee the precision of the framework by increasing the accuracy and also to be equipped for Machine Learning calculation. The augmentation strategy was actualized by utilizing accessible RSSI esteems at one location, wherein Random Forest gave the highest test accuracy of 96% surpassing all existing methods.

However, the massive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things (IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary through careful medium access arbitration. In this paper, we pro pose a new protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT. Basically, we leverage the emerging Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and promote the integration of a BLE transceiver and a Cognitive Radio module (CR) within the WBAN coordinator. Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR, an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a time-slot within the (FBTDMA) frame to retransmit using such IMC.

We can acquire basic kinematics and dynamics mechanism parameters (spatial position, speed, acceleration, vibration, angular rate, orientation, etc.) and some environment condition (local/remote temperature, humidity, pressure, electromagnetic noise) by MEMS sensors. Acquired data are sent to remote application in desktop computer. This system can replace expensive and separate diagnostic tools by small integrated solution with one wireless communication interface (with limitation of MEMS sensors precision). This solution can be battery powered with long operation time, because there is used new wireless technology based on Bluetooth 4 protocol (Low Energy/Smart Bluetooth). Some of integrated MEMS sensors measures same variable on different measuring principle. For example angle can be acquired from three different sensors: magnetometer, accelerometer or gyroscope. Combination of these sensor data can significantly improve value accuracy. The designed diagnostic tool can serve as an inertia measuring unit IMU or Wireless IMU (WIMU).

Dense Deployment of BLE-Based Body Area Networks: A Coexistence Study	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GREEN COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Body area network; Bluetooth low energy; wearable sensors; coexistence; energy efficiency		The issues of cross-technology interference and coexistence in the unlicensed 2.4-GHz spectrum band among various technologies including WiFi, ZigBee, and classic Bluetooth have been studied extensively. However, it remains relatively understudied for Bluetooth low energy (BLE), especially in densely deployed scenarios. In this paper, we develop a testbed to conduct our experimental studies, focusing on BLE and its coexistence capabilities when being deployed in a dense environment, under possible interference from WiFi and ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4. One scenario of interest is a network of several co-located BLE-based BANs, each of which is designed in a star topology with one gateway and multiple BLE sensor nodes. The second scenario represents a highly heterogeneous network where each BAN now carries both BLE and ZigBee sensors, while being exposed to interference from external WiFi transmission. Experiments are carried out on our testbed, which are built based on low-cost, light-weight off-the-shelf components and state-of-the-art BAN protocols. Our results show that the performance of BLE is relatively robust to interference from other BLE transmissions as well as those from nearby ZigBee and WiFi devices. In addition, the deployment of the testbed on human bodies results in no performance degradation for the network.	[Quang Duy La; Duong Nguyen-Nam; Ngo, Mao, V; Hoang, Hieu T.; Quek, Tony Q.

The proposed framework includes the following functionalities using only the received signal strength indicator obtained from the BLE sensors: 1) determining the location of the user, 2) estimating the user's moving direction, and 3) detecting the proximity of landmarks next to the user. We evaluate these functionalities individually. Moreover, we incorporate the proposed framework in PERCEPT indoor navigation system and test it with BVI users in a large public venue. Testing results show that the location, moving direction, and landmark proximity computed by the framework, although not very accurate, provide sufficient information to enable BVI users to independently navigate in large indoor venues. This conclusion aligns with Nobel Prize winning findings that confirm the spatial nature of the entorhinal-hippocampal system and the existence of a positioning system in the brain.

Instead of using passive radio frequency identification technology, the proposed system employs initiative Bluetooth low-energy communication technology. When an athlete is injured, they can immediately transmit a rescue request that contains their estimated location and the time of the injury. Upon receiving the rescue request, medical staff can respond rapidly. This study included three parts. First, the time required for a rescue team to receive a request from an injured athlete was estimated based on past international city marathon race records. Then, a software simulation was performed to extract the simplest transfer parameter requirements for system positioning. Finally, experimental samples were produced for field verification, and the rescue notification timing system was developed. This approach was found to successfully deliver 97.4%-99.9% of the athletes' request messages within 3-4 min and maintains the error range of the rescue locations under 15 m. It is appropriate for use in city marathons owing to its simple structure, low weight, low cost, and need for only common commercial technologies that are ready for mass production.

In this paper we suggest using a BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) profile adaptor which Interoperates data between objects based on DDS(Data Distribution Service), a real time standard middleware. With this BLE profile adaptor, BLE devices and other protocoled devices can interoperate data and by using the profile based Standard data format we can obtain wide interoperability between devices regardless of the BLE device's type or manufacturer.

BLE offers secure communication through a set of pairing strategies. However, these pairing strategies are obsolete in the context of IoT. The security of BLE based devices relies on physical security, but a BLE enabled IoT device may be deployed in a public environment without physical security. Attackers who can physically access a BLE-based device will be able to pair with it and may control it thereafter. Therefore, manufacturers may implement extra authentication mechanisms at the application layer to address this issue. In this paper, we design and implement a BLE Security Scan (BLESS) framework to identify those BLE apps that do not implement encryption or authentication at the application layer. Taint analysis is used to track if BLE apps use nonces and cryptographic keys, which are critical to cryptographic protocols. We scan 1073 BLE apps and find that 93% of them are not secure. To mitigate this problem, we propose and implement an application-level defense with a low-cost $0.55 crypto co-processor using public key cryptography.

Adversarial Robustness of Machine Learning-based Indoor Positioning Systems	DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN INFORMATION SCIENCES V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Disruptive Technologies in Information Sciences V	APR 12-16, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	SPIE		Machine learning; Indoor positioning systems; Bluetooth low energy; Received signal strength indicator		Determining position within an indoor environment can be difficult when GPS signals become too weak. For this reason, alternatives are desired for indoor positioning systems (IPSes). The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is one alternative solution for IPSes. BLE is a low power wireless technology used for connecting devices with each other. There are two different methods for using BLE for localization: deterministic, and machine learning (ML) models. Each method uses a measured received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to determine distances from fixed, known locations. Deterministic models rely on empirical equations relating signal strength to distance, while ML uses collected signal strengths, or fingerprints, to learn positions. This paper assesses the robustness of an IPS system we built that uses BLE and ML by executing a distance fraud attack. A distance fraud attack causes intentional miscalculations of positions. The attack executed on the system assumes the attacker has network access and has compromised some small fraction of the receiving nodes. The results show a significant difference between the calculated positions of the system operating under benign conditions and operating under attack. We explore one possible defense against this attack by training an ML system for attack identification.

J	Lee, J				Lee, Jaeho			Multichannel WPAN Protocol for Coexistence Under Densely Deployed Bluetooth LE in ISM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bluetooth low energy; coexistence; medium access control; performance analysis; IEEE 802.15.4	WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES; WI-FI; INTERNET; THINGS	With the dramatic growth of Bluetooth low energy (BLE), the indoor radio environment suffers from complex spectrum interference in the 2.4-GHz Industrial Scientific and Medical equipment (ISM) band, because BLE unconditionally transmits data without any carrier sensing or energy detection. With some recent trends reintroducing traditional wireless personal area networks standard for supporting the deployment of Internet of Things (e.g., Thread), IEEE 802.15.4 is spotlighted again, requiring mitigation of the mutual interference problem in the ISM band. For suitable coexistence under densely deployed BLE, this paper considers key impact phenomena of BLE characteristics, including studying a channelization and frequency-hopping mechanism. It finds a solution that can efficiently prevent problems by designing a multiple spectrum access scheme employing the same channelization that comes with BLE. To investigate the performance, this paper constructs a 4D Markov chain model describing the behavior of one communication node, and adopts an analytic matrix method to solve the model. The numerical results and experimental output are presented for further evaluation.

J	Alhazmi, R				Alhazmi, Raid			Design BLE Hub application for Positioning Accuracy of iBeacon Technology in Indoor Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY			English	Article						Global positioning; location tracking; Global Positioning,System (GPS); Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)		Global positioning and location tracking have become one of the common applications in various industries, especially in supply chain and logistics, smart cities, public transport systems etc. Location and tracking applications in the outdoor environment use Global Positioning System (GPS) to track the location of a device. For example, am application installed on a smartphone can use the phone location and generate maps and routes from the device location to a specific location as requested. However, location tracking and positioning in indoor environment have to rely on other technologies as the area covered is very small compared to GPS in outdoor environment. In addition, GPS may not be able to provide accurate information in an indoor environment. Currently, indoor location positioning and tracking is mainly based on the technologies such as WiFi, RFID, Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy etc. Similar to these indoor positioning technologies, iBeacon, is new device-to-device communication technology that relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). iBeacon technology is used in BLE communication for determining the distance between two devices. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is the strength of the beacon's signal as seen on the receiving device such as smartphone, used for positioning and location tracking. However, there are many signals' distortions and/or obstructions such as water, people body, thick walls and etc. in indoor communication between devices, which can affect the range and RSSI while estimating the distance between two communication devices. To address this issue, BLE Hub application design for smartphone, which can reduce distortions and/or obstructions of iBeacon signals is provided and discussed.

It affects the memory of the affected individual by causing neuron degeneration. Such cognitive disability leads people to roam around places since they are ignorant about location. They may go afar from the safe area to traffic prone areas which cause serious, life threatening issues to them. Proposed study introduces a technology that involves a wearable device for Alzheimer disease affected elderly patients and listening device given to care takers or doctors. This system detects and notifies caregivers about the departure of people to risk locations from their residence zone. This system uses Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) communication technology that utilizes transmitter and receiver fixed to elderly individual as wearable device and in residence respectively. Based on the signal strength between the transmitter and receiver, the distance estimation between the elderly and the receiver is calculated with the help of a Raspberry Pi(Rpi) and an alert notification is sent to doctors/caretakers when the distance exceeds safety limit.

Within the technologies and methods currently in use for indoor localization, the approaches that rely on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) anchors, Received Signal Strength (RSS), and lateration are among the most popular, mainly because of their cheap and easy deployment and accessible infrastructure by a variety of devices. Nevertheless, such BLE- and RSS-based indoor positioning systems are prone to inaccuracies, mostly due to signal fluctuations, poor quantity of anchors deployed in the environment, and/or inappropriate anchor distributions, as well as mobile device hardware variability. In this paper, we address these issues by using a collaborative indoor positioning approach, which exploits neighboring devices as additional anchors in an extended positioning network. The collaborating devices' information (i.e., estimated positions and BLE-RSS) is processed using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network by taking into account the device specificity in order to estimate the relative distances. After this, the lateration is applied to collaboratively estimate the device position. Finally, the stand-alone and collaborative position estimates are combined, providing the final position estimate for each device.

The diversity of applications and protocols and the custom needs for each environment introduce a big challenge for IoT applications, demanding the support of communication and message exchanges in implementations that aggregate diverse protocols. The paper addresses the design of an open-source multiprotocol gateway which supports two communication protocols, namely, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa. The proposed gateway represents the bridge between the devices and the network server and transports the received messages via a standard format readable by the network server. The messages between the gateway and the network server are transported over the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The paper details the implementation of the proposed multi-protocol gateway and highlights its benefits. In particular, the proposed gateway demonstrates support for multiple protocols on the same hardware base and eliminates the need of using multiple hardware components for each type of protocol.

Bluetooth (BT) and BLE are predominantly available in smartphones and are very useful for device-to-device communication. Most Bluetooth accessory (BTA) devices like BT headset, BT speaker and BT car-kit support only single connection. This behavior of BTA devices will hinder today's expectation of seamless continuity across multiple devices. User will encounter a connection failure, when user tries to connect a Smartphone to BTA device, which is already connected to other device. However, the reported reason for connection failure is "connection failed to be established" and is different from the exact reason, which is, "remote device is already connected". This is because BT device cannot differentiate between non-availability and the case where device is not responding. This will leave the user confused on which steps can ensure a successful connection. Device to device (D2D) communication can solve this connection issue and avoid confusion. To the best of our knowledge, this paper for the first time proposes a new concept that uses BLE's advertisement and scanning features to solve this connection issue by providing a connection shift from an already connected device, to the device that is trying to connect with the same BTA device. We have developed a prototype of our concept to present the results of connection shift and to provide analysis on difference in the time taken for connection shift during multiple attempts.

While traditional contact tracing approaches are gradually being replaced by peer-to-peer smartphone-based systems, the new applications tend to ignore the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem that is steadily growing in smart city environments. This work presents a contact tracing framework that logs smart space users' co-existence using IoT devices as reference anchors. The design is non-intrusive as it relies on passive wireless interactions between each user's carried equipment (e.g., smartphone, wearable, proximity card) with an IoT device by utilizing received signal strength indicators (RSSI). The proposed framework can log the identities for the interacting pair, their estimated distance, and the overlapping time duration. Also, we propose a machine learning-based infection risk classification method to characterize each interaction that relies on RSSI-based attributes and contact details. Finally, the proposed contact tracing framework's performance is evaluated through a real-world case study of actual wireless interactions between users and IoT devices through Bluetooth Low Energy advertising. The results demonstrate the system's capability to accurately capture contact between mobile users and assess their infection risk provided adequate model training over time. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic put a heavy strain on the healthcare system of many countries. Governments chose different approaches to face the spread of the virus and the contact tracing apps were considered the most effective ones. In particular, by leveraging on the Bluetooth Low-Energy technology, mobile apps allow to achieve a privacy-preserving contact tracing of citizens. While researchers proposed several contact tracing approaches, each government developed its own national contact tracing app. In this paper, we demonstrate that many popular contact tracing apps (e.g., the ones promoted by the Italian, French, Swiss government) are vulnerable to relay attacks. Through such attacks people might get misleadingly diagnosed as positive to SARS-CoV-2, thus being enforced to quarantine and eventually leading to a breakdown of the healthcare system. To tackle this vulnerability, we propose a novel and lightweight solution that prevents relay attacks, while providing the same privacy-preserving features as the current approaches. To evaluate the feasibility of both the relay attack and our novel defence mechanism, we developed a proof of concept against the Italian contact tracing app (i.e., Immuni). The design of our defence allows it to be integrated into any contact tracing app. To foster the adoption of our solution in contact tracing apps and encourage developers to integrate it in the future releases, we publish the source code.

Typical SDMA scheme requires estimations of channel state information (CSI) using orthogonal pilot sequences. However, the orthogonal pilot is not embedded in the BLE packet. This fact motivates us to apply ICA detector into BLE. In this case, there are three problems to be addressed. First, ICA requires a lot of samples for maintaining the accuracy of signal separation capability. Then, ICA suffers from phase ambiguity. Finally, noise enhancements are caused by ICA detector. To deal with all problems, we propose a unified design of ICA, differential detector, and SIC for SDMA of BLE. Regarding the packet error rate (PER) performance, computer simulations validate the proposed design.

This study presents a heating e-textile belt to provide the needed temperatures for thermotherapy using conductive thread as heating element. The belt was controlled wirelessly using an Android mobile application connected to the microcontroller through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The belt was set to provide temperatures of 33 degrees C to 44 degrees C for 5 to 30 minutes from four heating quadrants using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) as a control system. Bekinox 50/1 (BK 50/1) conductive thread heating element was tested for the accuracy of its produced temperature during a recommended thermotherapy session with a target temperature of 44 degrees C for 30 minutes. Using two-tailed paired-sample t-test, the result indicates that the heating e-textile belt produced temperatures that are reliably the same as the set temperature with T-score of 2.2130 and reference value of 2.262.

In Current scenario it is seen to be undergoing series of transition as the industry is moving towards digitization and is therefore ahead to connected mobility. Therefore the transports in today's generation have shifted from a conventional vehicle to intelligent vehicle which are equipped with advanced communication systems which alert or assist the driver. When the vehicles go online it becomes the part of intelligent transportation system with advanced connectivity features. This upcoming technology is said to be creating a new era of connected vehicle services. Here in this paper the implementation of V2V and V2I implementation of communication is using Beacons (Bluetooth Low Energy) and LoRaWan technology. This technology not only increases the safety aspects but on the also will provide ability to talk to nearby vehicles and infrastructures.

Since the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is not available at indoors, IPS research has been focused with alternative wireless technologies. Among them, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) have been widely used. In this paper, we discuss the RSS features of Wi-Fi and BLE measured under uniform conditions. Then, we show the typical weighted k-nearest neighbor (Wk-NN) fingerprinting positioning using Wi-Fi and BLE beacon individually for the IPS application. In addition, we propose a hybrid Wk-NN fingerprinting employing both BLE and Wi-Fi signals. The experiments were performed through real field deployments. The obtained results show that distance estimation and fingerprinting positioning accuracy using BLE is moderately better than Wi-Fi under identical AP deployment and signal attenuation condition. In addition, the proposed hybrid method shows better location accuracy compared to the BLE beacon and Wi-Fi when used individually.

The proposed method generates the whole list of error patterns, leading to a received syndrome containing up to a given maximum number of errors. Our approach is table-free, is computationally efficient, and can instantly correct erroneous packets when the output list contains a single element. A performance study is conducted, and shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing ones in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as it can correct all single- and double-error patterns as well as most triple-error cases when considering small payloads used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

In CIPSs, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can be used to exchange positioning data and provide information (the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)) to establish the relative distance between the actors. The collaborative models exploit the position of actors and the relative position among them to allow positioning to external actors or improve the accuracy of the existing actors. However, the traditional protocols (e.g., iBeacon) are not yet ready for providing sufficient privacy protection. This paper deals with privacy-enhancing technologies and their application in CIPS. In particular, we focus on cryptographic schemes which allow the verification of users without their identification, so-called Anonymous Attribute-based Credential (ABC) schemes. As the main contribution, we present a cryptographic scheme that allows security and privacy-friendly sharing of location information sent through BLE advertising packets. In order to demonstrate the practicality of our scheme, we also present the results from our implementation and benchmarks on different devices.

WMS leverages bluetooth low energy (BLE) in low power wide area networks (LPWANs) by dynamically changing the operating radio based on the proximity among herd of wild animals. This approach will facilitate ultra-low power IoT devices to be deployed for sustainable wildlife monitoring application. In addition we present an analytical model to investigate the performance of the proposed IoT network in terms of energy consumption under a wildlife monitoring use-case. The simulation results show that the dual radio network leads to a higher energy efficiency when compared to the network utilizing only LPWAN. Moreover, our network readily doubles the network life time for various data traffic rates.	[Ayele, Eyuel D.; Meratnia, Nirvana; Havinga, Paul J.

However, it is not designed for intermittent connectivity and opportunistic networking. Hence, the vast infrastructure that BLE-equipped devices such as smartphones, wearables, and sensors provide, remains untapped, even with its potential for data collection, sharing, or emergency communication in disaster scenarios. This paper introduces DISRUPTABLE to unfold this potential: A universal BLE-based store-and-forward architecture for delay-tolerant and opportunistic networking. Tailored to the resource constraints of IoT nodes and the feature set of BLE, DISRUPTABLE enables opportunistic interactions between BLE-equipped devices, providing a resilient network even when established communication over cellular networks or Wi-Fi fails. In our evaluation, we show that in a highly dynamic pedestrian scenario in downtown Stockholm, broadcasts reliably inform pedestrians in 7.1 seconds, while unicast messages arrive within 20 minutes in 48.1% of cases.

As a new technology in the Internet of Things (IoT) market, it is crucial to investigate the performance of Bluetooth Mesh. However, while a fundamental feature of Bluetooth Mesh is its suitability for energy-constrained devices, this aspect has not yet been properly considered in the literature. In this paper, we model the current consumption, lifetime and energy cost per delivered bit of a battery-operated Bluetooth Mesh sensor node. The model is based on measurements performed on a real hardware platform. Evaluation results quantify the impact of crucial Bluetooth Mesh parameters. Among others, we have found that a sensor device running on a simple 235 mAh battery, and sending a data message every 10 s, can achieve a lifetime of up to 15.6 months, whereas the asymptotic lifetime is 21.4 months.

The Dual Bloom Filter, consisted of the Interest Bloom Filter and the Forwarder Bloom Filter, achieve targeted forwarding and fair reward distributions among coupon forwarders. Particularly, the Interest Bloom Filter narrows down the target receivers (i.e. potential coupon users or forwarders) by user interest matching check, and the Forwarder Bloom Filter records all the coupon forwarder IDs in a space-efficient way. We use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to enable non-intrusive coupon transmission without manual connection setup. We conduct both large-scale simulation-based and implementation-based evaluations on our system. The simulation results show that our system realizes fast coupon propagation and fair reward distributions. The implementation is based on Android phones, such as Google and Samsung phones. The implementation results indicate that our system is capable of real-world deployment. We conclude that B-2-Coupon can effectively facilitate efficient and non-intrusive coupon distribution among mobile users.

With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), more and more devices get connected, each being a potential data source. One such potential source of constant data feed are sensor devices. Sensors that monitor a wide variety of environmental data such as air pressure, temperature, humidity, air constitution for specific components, etc. produce enormous amounts of data. We could easily envisage various ways of processing this data to suit various business needs. While there are various ways to monitor environmental data using complex hardware and software, there are costs associated with those approaches. One of the most important costs involves the power requirements of equipment itself. In this paper, we present an approach to monitoring environmental data using commodity hardware like the Raspberry Pi, commodity software and sensor elements. This should help serve as a simple proof-of-concept for building a power-efficient and economical environmental monitoring solution that can be scaled based on the expanse over which environmental data monitoring is desired. This solution may also be easily leveraged for other industrial applications given the vast types of sensor hardware that integrate easily with the Pi board. The use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) integrated in the Pi board, along with Beacon technology for data transmissions helps serve the purpose of a power efficient solution.	[Srinivasan, V.

Older adults often have low-activity and rather routine lives, which means that these routines can be an indicator of their physical and cognitive state in order to lead an independent life and healthy ageing. Therefore, it is important to be able to generate precise routines, as well as to monitor them, to trigger alarms in case of significant variations. This proposal defines routines based on the time spent in each of the monitored rooms. The daily time in each room is estimated trough a Bluetooth Low Energy-based indoor localization system. The localization is obtained through the Bluetooth received signal strength, which is processed with different supervised algorithms and fused with the acceleration measured by the mobile receiver, obtaining an accuracy above 96 %. From these data, the sample has been synthetically expanded to generate four different routines, on which the proposed algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis and Affinity Propagation clustering has been tested, obtaining very promising results.

However, not much prominence has been shown in analyzing certain factors that may affect the outcome of the fingerprinting method while designing the localization system. In this paper, we conduct a study to infer if a reduced number of receivers equipped with higher gain antennas can provide improved Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fingerprinting performance in a complex indoor environment. The evaluation is performed in a standard domestic apartment with an activity centric approach using a single wearable beacon and multiple receivers. A rank based route selection algorithm is used to list the candidate positions or routes that indicate the most likely path on which the subject was travelling. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits of implementing the inverse fingerprinting method with a trajectory based prediction model and also examine the effect of surrounding electrical interference. Experimental results indicate that an increased antenna gain in addition to deploying an adequate number of receivers have a positive effect on the overall ranking accuracy.

Among the wireless communication-based indoor positioning methods, the way using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has the advantage of being able to build an infrastructure at a low cost and use it in an environment with limited power supply. However, multipath and noise caused by wireless environment may degrade the location measurement accuracy. Machine learning-based methods have been proposed to resolve the problem, but they utilize only Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). BLE beacon can use extended advertisement according to user's intention, and the resulting change in PHY affects RSSI. This paper shows the effect of PHY on indoor positioning accuracy and proposes a deep learning-based indoor positioning method. We demonstrate that additional learning of BLE beacon's advertisement reception rate can increase accuracy. The accuracy of the location-prediction model was increased by 8.93% compared with the RSSI-only model, and the mean error distance was reduced by 15.02cm. In addition, even in the locations where advertisements were not collected, the locations were predicted with an error of 133.64cm using the data collected from a nearby location.

Among the central elements of such a state is the presence of humans and their number. For a smart office building, such information can be used for saving energy and safety purposes. While acquiring presence information is crucial, using sensing techniques that are highly intrusive, such as cameras, is often not acceptable for the building occupants. In this paper, we illustrate a proposal for occupancy detection which is low intrusive; it is based on equipment typically available in modern offices such as room-level power-metering and an app running on workers' mobile phones. For power metering, we collect the aggregated power consumption and disaggregate the load of each device. For the mobile phone, we use the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) nodes deployed around workspaces to localize the phone in a room. We test the system in our offices. The experiments show that sensor fusion of the two sensing modalities gives 87-90% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In many applications, both technologies need to be used in the same environment to fulfill application requirements. However, since they share the same 2.4 GHz ISM band, such networks may suffer from cross-technology interference, which decreases the reliability of the network. To solve this problem, we propose a cooperative coexistence solution for BLE and TSCH networks in which joint time-slot and channel hopping synchronization are performed. The proposed solution uses a scheduling matrix to model the resource usage of the networks. Following this, the overlaps in this matrix are eliminated by rescheduling the transmissions of the networks. The proposed solution does not require any protocol change. The performance of the proposed cooperative coexistence mechanism is evaluated using experiments with real wireless devices. The results of those show that our proposed solution considerably decreases Packet Error Rate (PER); an improvement of up to 45% PER is observed.

Both devices were fabricated on the same substrate with a red organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and an organic photodiode (OPD). Both were designed with a circular OLED at the center of the device surrounded by OPD. One device had an OLED area of 0.06 cm(2), while the other device had half the area. The gap distance between the OLED and OPD was 1.65 mm for the first device and 2 mm for the second. Both devices had an OPD area of 0.16 cm(2). We compared the power consumption and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of both devices and evaluated the PPG signal, which was successfully collected from a fingertip. The reflectance-based organic pulse meter operated successfully and at a low power consumption of 8 mu W at 18 dB SNR. The device sent the PPG waveforms, via Bluetooth low energy (BLE), to a PC host at a maximum rate of 256 kbps data throughput. In the end, the proposed reflectance-based organic pulse meter reduced power consumption and improved long-term PPG wireless monitoring.

J	Sultania, AK; Delgado, C; Blondia, C; Famaey, J				Sultania, Ashish Kumar; Delgado, Carmen; Blondia, Chris; Famaey, Jeroen			Downlink Performance Modeling and Evaluation of Batteryless Low Power BLE Node	SENSORS			English	Article						batteryless; Bluetooth Low Energy; energy harvesting; IoT; low power node	SENSOR	Deploying low maintenance and long-life systems is an important requirement of emerging commercial Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Such systems can be envisioned in which the connected devices are powered by energy harvested from ambient sources and stored in long-lifetime capacitors rather than short-lived and polluting batteries. However, due to the unpredictable nature of ambient energy harvesting, such batteryless IoT devices might not always have enough energy to initiate communication. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) specification defines support for Low Power Nodes (LPNs) using the friendship feature, where the LPN is associated with a neighbouring friend node (FN). The LPN can receive downlink (DL) data and remain connected to the network via the FN that buffers the LPN's incoming packets while allowing the LPN to save energy by sleeping or turning itself off. This novel BLE feature makes the LPN highly suitable to support the connection of batteryless ambiently-powered IoT devices. While the LPN can decide when to transmit uplink (UL) packets and does not depend on the FN to receive downlink (DL) data, the LPN needs to poll its FN to receive the buffered packets. However, the DL packet latency increases with this process due to the buffering time at the FN. Therefore, in this work, we present an analytical model to characterize the performance as a function of DL data latency and packet delivery ratio (PDR) of a batteryless LPN powered by different harvesting powers and capacitor sizes. This would help to optimally choose the correct configuration of the batteryless LPN for its network deployment. We also compare the analytical model and simulation results, showing consistency with an average error of 2.23% for DL data latency and 0.09% for the PDR.

Many technologies have been used for indoor positioning system but requirement is low cost, energy efficient and stable technology. To fulfil this requirement, Bluetooth low energy(BLE) tags are used due to its low cost and energy efficiency for positioning of user in the indoor building. Our approach is deployment of BLE tags on the ceiling of rooms and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of tags is calculated. When any smart phone enters within the range of BLE tags which are already deployed in the rooms, the tag with high received signal strength will be nominated and information of that tag along with the information of user will be uploaded to the Web server.

Experiments soon showed that RSSI values measured by devices vary significantly even when conducted under identical setups. As a result, BLE beacons can be used for what they are designed, i.e., proximity detection. However, setting up indoor positioning systems that cover complete floors and buildings with acceptable accuracy and out of the box is far from being straightforward. This paper evaluates setups for BLE indoor positioning at an inhouse fair to position dedicated smartphones among visitors and exhibition stands. It investigates how established positioning approaches, namely trilateration, fingerprinting, and centroid, respond to the impact of the crowd. Experiments show for the.95 percentile that the weighted centroid technique WCWCL achieves the highest position accuracy of 5.7 meters in the crowded space. Fingerprinting, on the other hand, is heavily impacted by the crowd. While most accurate in an empty/uncrowded space, its accuracy decreases to 11 meters in the crowded space. Further, the paper shows that for a setup with randomly distributed beacons a density of one beacon per 40 square meter is a sweet spot beyond which accuracy does not further increase.

The real time simulator is a simulation using the data collected in real time, which is effective in reduce prediction error and support quick decision making. Because of a high analytical cost in the conventional work measurement, it is difficult to continuously collect workers' position and motion data of the cellular manufacturing system in real time. For this purpose, we built an experimental cellular manufacturing line that is able to easily collect the data in real time using the Bluetooth low energy beacons. Next, we analyzed the collected data to extract production cycle time of each product. Finally, we constructed a real time simulation to combine the analyzed workers' position data and a discrete event simulation. The results of the real time measurement with BLE beacons have revealed that, the method is as good as the video camera analysis, but it has a few failures to extract the start of the production cycle time. The results of the real time simulation were able to decrease the prediction error than using the standard work time.

The scattering technology reflects and modulates an incident continuous wave (CW) signal such that the scattered signal is receivable by a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) receiver of a regular mobile telephone. The modulation performs a 4 MHz frequency shift of the incident CW signal combined with frequency shift keying for information transmission. The relative low range of frequency shifting allows a controlling of the modulation by a low energy micro-controller (MCU). The MCU receives its operational energy from an RF harvesting circuit, which accumulates and intermediately stores the energy of the incident CW signal. The MCU operates as signal generator and generates a modulation control signal by using its internal asynchronous components such as RC oscillator and counter, and uses an external 1 MHz crystal as time base for digitally changing the frequency of the oscillator in dependency of the information to be transmitted. Thus, the reception of unidirectional BLE advertising messages combines scattering technology and RE energy harvesting. Based on this technology, we achieved a 50% power efliciency improvement at the transponder tag, i.e. 9.2 mW active mode power consumption, which is encouraging and promnotes expectations of further progress in this direction.

Functions such as turning on and off lights can occur automatically or locking and unlocking doors can be done using LBS. By knowing the location of a user, appliances can be automated to function once the user is near them. Through the use of indoor localization, a user's position can be calculated. When designing an indoor localization system the density of transmitters plays an important role in maximizing the accuracy obtained. Increasing the number of references can improve the accuracy by providing additional information that the system can use in calculating a location. However, placing too many transmitters in the area can create interference in signals and negatively impact the localization results, while not having enough transmitters will hinder localization as not enough information is available. In this paper, we examine the optimal number of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to be used for indoor localization to optimize localization accuracy. Two algorithms were compared: trilateration and nonlinear least squares applying two types of filtering: moving average, and Kalman. Nine different types of systems were developed and compared in terms of accuracy and precision. According to experimental results placing six beacons in an environment will produce the optimal results. Using a nonlinear least squares algorithm with the three closest references with a moving average filter produced the lowest error of 1.149 meters with a standard deviation of 0.698 meters.

In this work, we propose a two-step model-based indoor positioning algorithm based on Bluetooth Low-Energy, a pervasive and energy efficient standard protocol. In the first (i.e. ranging) step a Kalman Filter (KF) performs the fusion of both RSSI and Time-of-Flight measurement data. Thus, we demonstrate the benefit of not relying only on RSSI, comparing ranging performed with or without the help of ToF. In the second (i.e. positioning) step, the distance estimates from multiple anchors are combined into a quadratic cost function, which is minimized to determine the coordinates of the target node in a planar reference frame. The proposed solution is tailored to reduce the computational effort and target real-time execution on an embedded platform, demonstrating a limited loss of performance. The paper presents an experimental setup and discusses meaningful results, demonstrating a robust BLE-based indoor positioning solution for embedded systems.

It leverages BLE to employ the user devices to act as mobile beacons. Its potential applications include community-based social networking, localized advertising, and instant reviewing. To evaluate the potential for this system and inform design, we conducted an exploratory interview study of 27 participants of a hypothetical localized content-creating system. Using a design prototype and multiple scenarios as prompts, we asked questions regarding users' perceptions of the potential benefits and challenges of a users-as-beacons system, focusing in particular on their privacy concerns and needs. Our results indicate that users do perceive the benefit of increased trustworthiness of user-beacons, but do not have expectations of greater location or behavioral tracking privacy. We highlight multiple design challenges of this system in supporting the trustworthy, relevant, and timely sharing of posts between people in a community.

These devices communicate with each other via a communication protocol, such as Zigbee or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the subject of this paper. Communication protocols are notoriously hard to implement correctly and a large set of test-cases is needed to check for conformance to the standard. Many of us have encountered communication problems in practice, such as random mobile phone disconnects, difficulty obtaining a Bluetooth connection, etc. In this paper, we research the application of industry strength Model-Based Testing (MBT) within the IoT domain. This technique contributes to higher quality specifications and more efficient and more thorough conformance testing. We show how we can model part of the BLE protocol specification using the Axini Modeling Platform (AMP). Based on the model, AMP is then able to automatically test the conformance of a BLE device. With this approach, we found specification flaws in the official BLE specifications as well as conformance errors on a certified BLE system.

Since various sensors and communication chips have been integrated into smartphones, it has become feasible to provide indoor positioning using phones. This paper proposes such a solution based on a smartphone, combining Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) in the particle filter framework to realize real-time and reliable indoor positioning. First, the smartphone's built-in accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope are used to provide data measurements and formulate a feasible method for PDR. Second, a range-free weighted centroid algorithm is proposed to realize BLE-based localization with low computation complexity. However, a single positioning technology has limitations, e.g., the cumulative error of PDR and the received signal strength fluctuation of BLE. Finally, to exploit the complementary strengths of each technology, a fusion framework utilizing a particle filter is proposed to combine PDR and BLE-based methods and provides more stable and accurate positioning results. Experiments are conducted on a floor in a campus building. Experimental results show that our proposed fused positioning method offers more accurate and stable performance in the long run compared with single PDR or BLE-based positioning. The achieved average positioning error is 1.34 m, which is reduced by 24.16% compared with PDR positioning and 10.60% compared with BLE-based positioning. Moreover, about 95% of the positioning errors are smaller than 1.7 m. The proposed fused positioning method has a vast application prospect in indoor navigation, indoor user tracking, and interactive experience for indoor visitors.
